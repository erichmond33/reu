    "text": "A few weeks ago I got news that my dear Aunt Sandy passed away and went to be with the Lord. It didn\u2019t take me by surprise. She had the worst case of brain cancer of the worst kind. Outside of a miracle, there simply was no chance of recovery. What did surprise me was that she developed cancer at all. Just a month and a half ago, Aunt Sandy was living a normal life with no problems and no signs of cancer. Fast forward two weeks and she\u2019s lying on a hospital bed immobilized and virtually unresponsive. It all happened so fast and it came out of nowhere.\nThe recent passing of Aunt Sandy reminds me that dying could happen sooner rather than later. In fact, I have a chronic G.I. disorder that\u2019s eluded diagnosis. It\u2019s not a stretch for me to imagine it turning terminal at some point (not that I\u2019m in any perceivable danger at the moment).\nBut my own health struggles coupled with the loss of my aunt has forced me to think a lot about my own dying. Bear in mind, I\u2019m not talking about death. I\u2019m talking about dying. There\u2019s a difference. Death is the cessation of life that ushers you into the next. Dying is the duration of time that precedes death where your body is an observable state of accelerated decline. Put more simply, dying is having one foot in the grave; death is having both. I\u2019ve thought a lot about death before and what awaits me in the next life. But until now I\u2019ve given little thought to what my own deathbed experience will look like (assuming, of course, God chooses to give me one). What will happen in those final moments as I wait for death to come? And what do I want those precious last minutes to look like?\nI\u2019m thankful that the deathbed doesn\u2019t have to be a terrifying, lonely, or depressing ordeal. The Apostle Paul says as much in a little known part of a well known verse, \u201cFor to me to live is Christ, and TO DIE is gain\u201d (Philippians 1:21). He doesn\u2019t say death is gain, which is what I know we\u2019re all tempted to make him say. Death certainly is gain because pain stops and eternal bliss begins. But Paul says \u201cto die is gain.\u201d Dying\u2014the process that leads up to death, however short or long it may be\u2014that is gain. It is gain for the believer to go through those last moments, however long and agonizing they may be. It almost sounds too good to be true, doesn\u2019t it? To experience gain on your deathbed. I don\u2019t know about you, but I want a little piece of that pie. I want to be able to say on my deathbed along with the Apostle Paul, \u201cDying is gain.\u201d So I decided to put together a small wish list for what I would like any dear family and friends to do for me when that day comes. Here\u2019s how you can make my deathbed experience gain. And I hope this will serve as an encouragement to you when you have to be the one sitting by someone\u2019s bedside or actually in the bed yourself.\nRead me the Gospel. Reading Scripture to a dying loved one is very common for Christians, so I don\u2019t necessarily want to state the obvious or beat a dead horse, but I would feel irresponsible if this wasn\u2019t on at the top of my list! And yet while this is standard for any Christian deathbed experience, I do have a special request here. I love familiar deathbed passages like Psalm 23, John 14:7, Revelation 22:1-5, Romans 8:38-39, and a host of other promises and reassurances about my passing and soon-to-be reunion with Jesus. But I don\u2019t just want to hear about \u201cwhat will be.\u201d I\u2019m actually more interested in \u201cwhat has been.\u201d No offense, but I\u2019m about ready to experience \u201cwhat will be\u201d for all eternity. But what I want to remember is why I get to experience \u201cwhat will be\u201d in the first place. Take me to the gospel. Talk to me about the work of Christ. For example, don\u2019t just encourage me with the wonderful truth that I can\u2019t be separated from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39). Give me the basis for why God will never forsake me (Romans 8:31-34), that it\u2019s based on a zealous and concrete act of God to justify me through His heroic Son Jesus Christ. Rehearse for me the doctrines of predestination, imputation, substitutionary atonement, redemption, adoption, and union with Christ by reading for me those Scriptures that illuminate these profound truths. Take me to Ephesians 1:4. Guide me through Romans 5:12-21. Put on repeat 2 Corinthians 5:21. Preach to me 1 Peter 1:18\u201319. Recite John 1:12. Pray me through all of John 17. Scratch that. Expand it to John 14 through 17. I won\u2019t care that it\u2019s long. I don\u2019t have anywhere else I need to be at that point. I\u2019m not going anywhere. The single greatest way you can make my deathbed gain is to give me the gospel one more time.\nPray with me. I love watching Christians encourage dying saints with statements like, \u201cPraying for you!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re in my prayers!\u201d It\u2019s great to watch the body of Christ encourage one another with these assurances. But when I\u2019m dying, I personally don\u2019t just want to know that you\u2019re praying for me. I want to know what you\u2019re praying for me about and, if given the opportunity, I even want to hear you pray. It\u2019ll be nice to get a message like, \u201cYou\u2019re in my prayers, James.\u201d But it\u2019ll be music to my ears when I hear you say, \u201cI\u2019m praying that your faith remains strong, James, and that the Lord will keep you secure until you rest safely in His arms.\u201d You want to thrill my heart and send shivers down my spine? Explain to me what you\u2019ve been praying or just take the time to pray with me. The more specific you can get with me about what you\u2019re praying and how you\u2019re praying, the more encouraged I know I\u2019ll be. Telling me you\u2019re praying for me reminds me that you love me. But praying for and sharing your requests with me reminds me how God loves me. I want both, don\u2019t get me wrong. But (don\u2019t take this personally) I want the latter more. So let me know what you\u2019re praying. You and I will be better off for it!\nRaise the roof with theologically rich music. You heard me. Let\u2019s rock the hospital halls with great hymns of the faith and deep modern worship music. Give me a balanced combination of older classics and newer stalwarts. So, that rules out the old timey stuff, like the \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away\u201d songs\u2014as fun and apropos as those may be. Give me, instead, the \u201cBe Thou My Vision\u2019s.\u201d Give me the \u201cHow Firm A Foundation\u2019s.\u201d And while you\u2019re at it, give me 2.0, \u201cJesus Firm Foundation.\u201d Give me the Getty\u2019s \u201cBy Faith\u201d or Enfield\u2019s version of \u201cLead On, O King Eternal.\u201d And on a purely personal note, please don\u2019t go for the slow, melodic songs that everyone wants to associate with death. Pick some upbeat ones. Just because you\u2019re sad doesn\u2019t mean you have to make me sad too on my way out. I\u2019m headed for paradise, people, and I don\u2019t want to have to explain to my eternal Champion why I have a frowny face for my first few seconds of glory. I want my first encounter with my Savior to be pure elation! So make it a seamless transition. Obviously, I\u2019m speaking a little tongue-in-cheek here. There\u2019s an appropriate amount of grief that\u2019s expected and needed. But please don\u2019t make me depressed in my final hours! I fail to see how that\u2019s Philippians 1:21 gain.\nBe sensitive to everyone else. When a traumatic event takes place in the life of a family, it\u2019s inevitable that emotions will be all over the place and tensions are going to run high. Often the person on the deathbed\u2019s the most calm and relaxed of the bunch. But those of us beside the deathbed can quickly develop a sinful tendency that redirects our grief and frustration into anger and backbiting towards others. We\u2019re careful with what we say to the dying, but then take out our frustration on everyone else. But when I\u2019m on my deathbed, I don\u2019t just want you smiling at me. I want you smiling at everyone else. There\u2019s got to be nothing more discouraging for the bed-ridden on his last leg than to watch the most precious people in his life squabbling. I actually don\u2019t think this will be a problem for the people in my life at the moment, but I realize that\u2019s not always the case with every family. Be sensitive to others and put the same kind of energy into your relationships with them as you do with the person on his deathbed.\nGet some sleep. If you\u2019re the type who\u2019s deeply relational and loves to worry, this is gently meant for you. I know you love me, but God loves me too. Please get some sleep. You don\u2019t need to worry. He\u2019ll take care of me when you drift off. If I\u2019m on my deathbed, I\u2019m not getting any better and I probably don\u2019t want to be. So please don\u2019t concern yourself too much with me. Take care of yourself. You obviously still have more life to live than I do and I don\u2019t want my last picture of you to be one of a worried wreck. Believe that God\u2019s in control, because He is, and that you\u2019re not, because you aren\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing you can do to change my situation by losing sleep. So do you and me a favor and get some rest. Your healthy rested face just might bring a bigger smile to mine.\nThis entry was posted in Theology by James Street. Bookmark the permalink.",

    "text": "Living overseas as an American has it\u2019s great points but sometimes it has a lot of challenges that you don\u2019t think about. For instance, most of the rest of the world uses the Metric system. Which makes a lot of sense as the Metric system is much simpler and easier to remember.\nThat said, if you grew up in America, you likely don\u2019t have the foggiest idea how hot or cold it is when someone gives you a temperature in Celsius. Stay with me here and we\u2019re going to have a quick math lesson so that you can do a basic conversion in your head. Then you won\u2019t look silly having to ask if it is hot or cold the next time someone gives you a forecast.\nDouble the temperature in Celsius and add 30.\nIf someone says it was 30 degrees Celsius then you simply double it (to 60) and add another 30 to get 90. 30 degrees Celsius is pretty hot.\nIf it\u2019s only 10 degrees Celsius then double it (to 20) and add another 30 to get 50. A bit chilly.\nIf you\u2019re like us and live in the frigid North and someone tells you it\u2019s going to be -30 degrees this weekend, double it (-60) and add 30 to find out it\u2019s\u2026really stinkin\u2019 cold outside.\nIncidentally the further you get from freezing the less accurate this is so don\u2019t use this rule for cooking unless you want some unpleasant surprises.\nAsking questions of those who have \u201cbeen there\u201d is a great way to prepare yourself for the crazy adventure that is moving to China. Even though you can never be completely prepared for such a drastic change, knowing what to expect goes a long way to making the transition much smoother. I was so thankful to have a fellow expat friend who generously fielded numerous questions before our move. It was such a huge help to us, and one of the main reasons I decided to start this blog. I recently received a question from a reader, and I thought I\u2019d share the questions and response in case it helps someone else in a similar situation.\nMy family has LOVED all the information we have learned from reading all of your posts. I\u2019m sure we haven\u2019t gotten through everything yet, but we are learning from it. If all goes according to plan we (my husband and I, as well as our 3 kids) will be moving to Shenyang the beginning of 2012. I was hoping that ya\u2019ll could help me with a few questions. For one, I wondered what host site you use for your blog? The one you guys have set up is exactly what we would like to have in place.\nSecond, how hard has it been to stay connected technology wise? Like I said, we have 3 kids. I have read that there are ways around the government blocks online, but I have read so many positive and negative things now that I\u2019m just confused. It is very important to us to try to keep our technology connections so that our kids don\u2019t feel completely cut off. At this point we don\u2019t even know whether to purchase computers from the US before we leave or China once we get there. We really want to be able to contact family and share all the adventures they are having.\nAgain, we have really enjoyed reading about all of your experiences (although I gotta say I literally gagged last night reading about the taxi driver chewing on his hack!!! I already know that the first time I hear that sound and realize what it is\u2026.I will most likely puke! Oh well, that will just be another story to share, lol) We look forward to any future posts and any information you guys can share with us.\nI recently received a question from a reader asking for advice and insight on their upcoming move to Shenyang. I thought the question and response might be helpful for someone else as well, so with permission I\u2019ve posted our correspondence. If you\u2019re currently on expat assignment and have something else to add, I\u2019d love for you to chime in on the subject in the comments. If you\u2019re not yet an expat but also have questions, feel free to ask away and I or my fellow expats will try to fill in with what we\u2019ve learned so far.\nThe more information we can share, the better off we\u2019ll all be.\nHi. My husband and I just returned from a job interview in Shenyang. The company flew both of us over for a look-see and interview. We were there for 3 days. (I know, who goes all the way to China and stays for just 3 days?) The work would likely be in both Shenyang and Yingkou, or perhaps mainly in Yingkou. It would be a 2-3 year contract.\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice you\u2019d like to share. My husband is supposed to let the company know what he wants for compensation and benefits. Are there benefits you\u2019d recommend asking for? What about Chinese taxes? Are there employers who pay taxes for their employees? We saw that the marginal rate goes up to 45%, and then we would owe US taxes as well. I read in China Daily while we were there that foreign workers will now be covered by the Chinese social security, medical and unemployment insurance, to the tune of an additional 11% payroll deduction. That wouldn\u2019t leave much for us!\nWe recognize the challenges we\u2019d face living in China, and think that we can not just manage, but truly come to enjoy the adventure. I\u2019ve enjoyed reading about your experiences, and look forward to having our own China stories to share.\nLB and I finally got the chance to go through some of your questions (I have no idea about a lot of the details like taxes and stuff.) We had a few thoughts on the subject between us. Not sure how it works out with you, but we were pretty fortunate to be sent by an international company who has quite a few expats here already. It was NOT a perfect process by any means (get ready to be flabbergasted over and over\u2026 and make sure you throw any expectations you have out the window. You\u2019ll be much better off for it.) but they do take care of us pretty well. Will you be working for a Chinese company as a foreign expert? Not sure how that will change the process, but it surely will. It is a different culture for sure. Make sure you get it all in writing, but realize even then, that doesn\u2019t always mean a whole lot when you\u2019re dealing with this culture. You\u2019ll still have to ask for things even if they\u2019re in the contract.\nYou\u2019ll want to keep these things in mind at the very least.\n1. Housing: Make sure they are providing you with housing. Most companies do. A budget of 15,000 \u2013 20,000 RMB per month should be sufficient for a furnished apartment or, in some cases a townhouse, in a nice complex/neighborhood although that will likely vary a lot depending on what city you\u2019re in. That will get you a very nice apartment in Shenyang.\nAnother option would be to negotiate a smaller monthly allowance for an unfurnished apartment plus a stipend for purchasing furniture or shipping your own furniture from the States. This was actually the option we chose, and I was really glad we did. It was great to be able to choose my own furniture and design my own home rather than feeling like I was living in someone else\u2019s house. I will say that if it hadn\u2019t been for the new Ikea in Shenyang though, I doubt this option would have worked out as well. Also, I don\u2019t think this is very common in China. Most apartments come furnished, I believe, but it worked out really well for us.\nOur company goes through a realty company who specializes in placing expats (We used KELT. There is alsoCentury 21 in Shenyang). It was a big help dealing with people who speak English and who\u2019s job it is to take care of the lease, dealing with the landlord, getting your proper permits, etc. We also don\u2019t deal with paying the rent at all. That is paid directly by the company. We do pay for utilities though. We\u2019ve been here almost a year and still occasionally contact them with any issues we have with our apartment (like yesterday, when we woke up to no electricity). Our realtor has become a great friend who I call on for all kinds of questions and translating. She was indispensable in the beginning when we were just learning to function here.\nIf they do agree to pay for your housing, make sure you are able to pick your apartment, or at least see where it is they want to put you. The exact apartment. Most apartments are privately owned and one building can have several levels of quality. I would suggest negotiating a \u201chousing allowance\u201d and then shopping for your own place. To me, it is the most important part about making this place feel like home. Especially for you as the wife since you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time there.\n2. Car and driver: I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019ll work out working both in Yingkou and Shenyang but google maps says it is about 2.5 hours drive. If you\u2019ll have to do a lot of commuting back and forth I would definitely make sure you are provided with a car and driver. Inside Shenyang, it is no problem getting around with the buses and plenty of taxis. We don\u2019t have a car and do fine without it, but I think if you\u2019ll be outside the city then you\u2019ll need one.\n3. Language lessons: You need to learn Chinese to really have a good experience here. It\u2019s a difficult language and some people don\u2019t bother learning it but I think you have a much less frustrating experience when you can break down the communication barrier even just a little. I would suggest asking for a set language budget or set number of hours of tutoring for both you and your husband. I think the companies I\u2019ve heard of usually offer 100 hours.\n4. Moving costs: Negotiate your shipping and moving costs. You\u2019ll probably need at least an air freight container. They come in several sizes. Another option is a sea freight container. They are much larger and are typically used if you want to bring your furniture from home. They take much longer to arrive however.\n5. Vacation time: This one has been a big issue for us. If you\u2019re going to want to travel a lot (and there is so much to see in Asia!) make sure you have enough time to take off to do it. I think you need at least 20 days, probably 25 would be better.\n6. Home flights: Will they pay for you to take a trip home once a year or twice a year? For both of you? If so, do you get extra days to compensate for the travel time or will you have to take vacation days? Something to think about considering it takes 3 days of traveling to get to the States and back.\n7. Taxes: This is the one I\u2019m not so sure about. You are responsible for taxes in both China and the US. You\u2019ll definitely need to hire a professional to take care of all the taxes. I would make sure that is also paid for by the company. Most companies here take responsibility for paying the Chinese taxes. (I\u2019m not sure about the China Social Security thing, haven\u2019t heard anything about that.) Our company takes care of all the taxes here and our pay stays the same. They also offset the taxes in the US so that we pay the same as we would if we were still employed in the US. One other thing to remember is that all of the benefits they pay for such as your car and driver, your housing, etc. is considered taxable income by the US government even though it isn\u2019t showing up in your bank account. Add it all up and that first tax bill will make your eyes pop out of your head.\n8. Getting paid: You want to get paid in the US if possible. There are two ways it is done here. One company that I know of pays 75% of your income in the US and 25% in Chinese RMB. Even at 25% most people don\u2019t spend that much and end up with lots of RMB left to change at the end. It is a real pain and quite difficult to change money back from RMB to US dollars. Our company pays 100% of our paycheck in to our US account and we then make a wire transfer (reimbursable at 1 per month) to our Chinese bank account in the amount we need. Either way works fine I think. Getting paid 100% in China is usually a huge hassle so I\u2019ve heard.\nSalary: Obviously it depends on the company, but generally, if you work as an expat for a foreign company you can expect your previous salary + 30-50% increase (b/c you have to live without Dunkin Donuts whole bean coffee and JIF peanut butter.) + cost of living adjustment + additional compensations listed above. I would say that most expats come to China for the money. But it is a GREAT experience even without the padding of the bank account!\nI really enjoyed hearing your guesses for the pop quiz. Thanks for playing along!\nWe had a few guesses on the original post, and a few more posted on Facebook.\nPop quiz\u2026 What is this?\nFound this taped to my door.\nWhat is it? What am I supposed to do with it?\nJust a little taste of what it\u2019s like living in a foreign country where you can\u2019t read or speak the language. Every day is an adventure. And the littlest simplest tasks become difficult.\nHint: You get something similar in the US and if I don\u2019t deal with it soon I\u2019m in trouble.\n1. Find the largest pot you have. If you have 2 or 3 large pots it works even better.\n2. Fill the pots with water and place them on the stove.\n4. Heat the water until you start to see bubbles.\n5. Using potholders (or folded up dishrags if like me you still don\u2019t have potholders), carry the pots of water one by one into the bathroom.\n6. Dump the hot water into the tub.\n7. Repeat steps 1-6 until you have enough water in the tub to bathe with. Turn on the faucet to add cool water if the water is too hot.\nHi. Just wanted to let you know we are having a problem with the hot water in the showers. Neither get hotter than luke warm. Definitely not hot enough to take a comfortable shower. The water in the kitchen sink gets quite hot, just not the bathrooms. Can we get this fixed soon?\nI just contacted with the management company and the staff told me the problem has existed about year.\nAfter the management company transformed the pipe system in Wulihe Plaza.\nAnd the problem extensively exist in the Wulihe Plaza.\nBefore the management company transform the pipe system again the problem can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be solved completely.\nBut there is a temporary solution is before you do the shower please call the management company 2388****, they will send a worker to make the water warmer.\nReally? You just want me to call you before I want to take a shower? Every day?\nAnd wait? This is the solution for the WHOLE building? 24 floors of apartments.\nIs there a guy whose sole job is to come heat up the water every time anyone wants to take a hot shower? There has to be. And how does he do it?\nAnd when that doesn\u2019t work: Refer to steps 1-7 above.\nSo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u2019ve been trying to get out of posting this little story. I mean, you don\u2019t really care to know EVERYTHING that happens to us on this little adventure, do you? Actually, I\u2019m not really sure you care to know any of it, but I\u2019m writing it down just the same. I was going to skim over this tidbit, but I realized\u2026 I just need to keep it real. Most of you already know what a dingbat I am anyway, and it\u2019s probably unlikely you\u2019ll even be surprised I\u2019d do something like this.\nOn Thursday morning, we met the realtor, Echo, at the apartment. She is Chinese, but speaks English ok and was appointed to answer questions and translate for us. When we arrived, a friend of the landlord was also there getting things ready, setting up the phone and internet, etc.\nI went to the kitchen first to check out the appliances and make sure everything was in working order. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this apartment, like the first, had a little TV in the kitchen. Both times, the realtor seemed really excited to show us this. To be honest, the first time I was unimpressed. Who has time to watch TV in the middle of cooking anyway? Besides that, most of the channels are in Chinese and the screen is only 6 inches across. Tiny.\nHowever, I knew from the first apartment that the TV wasn\u2019t just a TV. It was also a security camera! So cool! I know it may not be that exciting to you. But I was impressed.\nWhen I asked Echo about it, she mentioned that this one also had that capability, but she wasn\u2019t quite sure how to work it. She pushed a few buttons and we never could quite figure it out. I got bored for the moment and moved on. When I got back out to the living/ dining area, I noticed another screen mounted on the wall next to the door. I was sure this was a camera too. And I was determined to figure out how to use this thing. Not that I ever think we\u2019ll need it. I don\u2019t. But still, I must know how it works. It\u2019s just the way I am. No gadget can be left untouched.\nThere are 6 buttons on the panel. One of them has to work the camera, right? They are all labeled with Chinese characters, which I can\u2019t read of course, so without rhyme or reason I just decided to push them all until the camera came on. Easy enough.\nThe very first button on the right has red writing, looks the most to me like it would be a power or \u201cOn\u201d button. Wrong! As soon as I pushed it, it starts blinking red and a deafening alarm starts going off. I\u2019m in total \u201cOh Crap\u201d mode and start going down the line pushing every button on there to try and get it to stop. Well, Echo walks up beside me at that point and as I\u2019m going back down the line of buttons, frantically trying to find a combination that would shut the thing up. I start to push the same red button again, and Echo stops me.\nUmmm, WHAT?!? Did you say police??\nSo, I really didn\u2019t know much about China before we moved here (still don\u2019t, as a matter of fact), but the one thing I do know, is you want to steer clear of the police. (That really goes in just about every country, I think.) And I\u2019m pretty sure, you definitely don\u2019t want to call them to you, with a flashing red light and a blaring siren loud enough to wake the dead, for NO REASON! At this point, I\u2019m pretty much mortified. All the while trying to play it off like the siren just started going off by itself or the guy messing with the wiring set it off, and I was just \u201chelping\u201d by pushing buttons to try and shut it off.\nAs it turns out, I had very little to worry about. The alarm continued to go off for over an hour with no sign of the police. The landlord\u2019s friend did manage to reduce it to an intermittent blaring somehow. But it would only stay quiet for about 2 minutes before it would start again. I have to admit, about 45 minutes in, I\u2019m over the panic and getting a little annoyed. What if there really was an emergency? What good is that stupid little thing, except to trick button-happy foreigners into bursting their ear drums?\nWell, someone did eventually come and turn off the alarm. I was conveniently in another room at the time so I didn\u2019t get to see them fix it. I\u2019m not sure exactly how Echo explained the situation but it probably went something like: \u201cThat crazy white woman in there got all geeked out over the security camera. Apparently they don\u2019t have those in Iva.\u201d Yeah well, maybe not. But we have tractors. And cows. Where are your cows?\nOn a side note, none of the buttons actually turned on the security camera. We found out later, it comes on automatically when someone pushes the doorbell.\nSo how do you translate\u2026 ummm, oops?",

    "text": "ABOUT Loch Lomond I can claim one unwanted distraction. I know it from within as well as without, for with a friend, I\u2019ve been overturned in the 600ft-deep middle stretch between Rowardennan and Inverbeg, clinging desperately to an upside-down canoe and buffeted by a June north-easter.\nThe story, which happened about 20 years ago, could be called \u201cHow to Lose \u00a3250 of Cameras,\u201d and I would have left them ashore had I known then that the easterly airt is the dangerous one for canoeing on Loch Lomond. My companion had just told me to stop worrying about the squalls that were rocking the canoe, when an arrowhead of advancing rain and wind struck. I remember the canoe sliding into a trough, being lifted on to the crest of a wave, and then neatly turning over.\nThere was no time for fear as I strove to break free from a canoe which was holding me like a cork in a bottle. I had the strange vision of being in a dream, watching myself drown when my body was suddenly released and I felt myself going down and down into darkness. Again I had the feeling of seeing myself as on film turning over in the water like a seal in a tank and breaking through a greenish roof into daylight.\nIn front of me was the upside-down canoe with my companion clinging to it, shouting my name. A few strokes and I was beside him, trying to get a grip as it spun awkwardly under our combined weight. \u201cI was getting worried \u2013 you took a long time to come up,\u201d he said, I said it must have been my camera bag jamming my knees against the deck, acting as a plug.\nThe loch was so choppy we felt hidden by the waves, nor had we much hope of our cries being heard. On the credit side, however, was the certainty that we must be cast up on the far shore of the loch if only we could hang on long enough.\nAfter half an hour the cold was having a weakening effect on hands and arms. But we were lucky. We were spotted by two of our friends in single canoes. They came alongside and we transferred our grip from the over turned canoe to their sterns and were towed ashore by hard paddling.\nTo get warm, we ran up and down while our companions lit a bonfire on the beach. Clothing was wrung out, dry garments offered and a phone call was put in to Rowardennan to summon a vehicle to drive round the loch and take us back to the Youth Hostel.\nThis is what you call paying for your experience the hard way, and I felt lucky to have paid no more for it than a steep rise in insurance premium for the new cameras I\u2019d bought. Our accident had occurred because neither of us possessed any practical experience of canoeing. My friend admitted afterwards that his knowledge was mainly theoretical.\nJust how dangerous is Loch Lomond to people in small boats? Well, just over a hundred years ago Sir James Colquhoun, fourth Baronet of Luss, went over to shoot fallow deer on Inchlonaig with his keepers. It was December, and the venison was to be distributed among the people of the village. At the end of the day, the loaded boat was seen passing Inchconnachan only a mile and a bit from home at Rossdhu, but neither the boat nor its occupants were ever seen again.\nTo form an opinion about Loch Lomond you have to be out in it in all weathers. I asked my friend John Groome, who for nine years has lived on the lonely Craig Rostan shore and has to depend on a boat to collect mail, provisions, fuel and other necessities of isolated living.\nI\u2019d say it is a wicked loch,\u201d lie told me. \u201cIt looks O.K. until you try to cross. I\u2019ve been in real danger many times. I\u2019ve been lost for an hour in freezing fog, and it was not until I saw the lights of a car that I realised I was close inshore on the wrong side of the loch. I tried again, and found myself at Rowchoish, too far south \u2014 but at least I knew where I was. 1 was absolutely chilled when I got in. My boat now carries a compass.\nThe month is May. It is nearly two o\u2019clock in the morning and we have been tramping since 10 p.m. Marvellous at last to spread our sleeping bags under a sheltering rock on a grass shelf above the burn. Bliss to be here after the big effort of catching the last bus to Balmaha with a 10-hour working day in Glasgow shops behind us.\nLater that morning wood-smoke and the smell of frying bacon brings me to pleasant consciousness. Around me I can hear a tinkling of willow warblers, the trills of wrens, the jangle of redstarts and the hum of a Gaelic song from Matt, in his element cooking over a wood fire.\nFrom our eyrie on the MacGregor shore we feel as free as Rob himself, wage-slaves no longer, but with hearts light as the blue sky as we set off along the high contouring path in a scent of bluebells and rowan blossom. Below us, oak woods plunge to the shore and soon we are on the edge of the Cuilness gorge in a stronghold of the pied flycatcher.\nGreat views open behind us as we climb. Down across the loch is Inveruglas Isle, with the ruin of the McFarlane castle sacked by Cromwell. Beyond the plunge of the gorge are the rocks of Craig Rostan, peppered with MacGregor ruins. Among them are some old charcoal- burning \u201d bloomeries \u201d for smelting iron. We throw ourselves down, necks reclining on rucksacks.\n\u201d You canny beat it,\u201d says Matt as hee identifies the snow-veined peaks forming the headwall of Glen Falloch.\nWe can see the passes of the Lairig Arnan and the Dubh Eas which lead from Loch Lomond through to Loch Fyne, ancient cattle-droving routes which brought easy booty to the reiving MacGregors and McFarlanes, whose forays persisted long after they had died down in other parts of the Highlands.\nThe Government built a barracks at Inversnaid to contain Rob Roy, but he destroyed it before it could be completed\u2014a far-seeing chief .\nOn again we strike east for the twisting north ridge of Ben Lomond, crossing a big, peaty hollow where red deer rise from the hags and race for a rock outcrop to stand in elegant grace looking down on us.\nThis remotest bit of the Ben is, alas, coveted by hydro-electric engineers, who see in it a site for a reservoir. The plan is to build a big wall of concrete to seal the hollow so that water can be pumped 1200 feet from Loch Lomond into it. As on Ben Cruachan, the water could then be brought down to an underground power-house to make it one of the largest pumped storage schemes in the world, providing up to 2000 megawatts of electricity in its finished form.\nWe revel in the totality of the natural world around us as we dump our bags on the Cruinn a\u2019 Bheinn- Ben Lomond col, and fairly dance up the airy ridge curving to the top of the most southerly Munro in Scotland.\nThe view is all we hoped for. Yonder, Ailsa Craig and the \u201cSleeping Warrior\u201d of Arran, with, behind it, the dark outline of the Antrim coast from whence came the Celts who gave Scotland its name. Below us is the dark corrie of the Ben, with a wee burn tumbling out of it\u2014the beginning of the River Forth. Its course is signposted for us by the crag of Stirling Castle and the chemical retorts of Grangemouth where it reaches the sea. Westward lie Jura and Mull.\nFrom up here we can see clearly how man had such easy access to the Highlands from the Firth of Clyde, with Loch Long threading inland for 16 miles to end below the rock prongs of the Cobbler, an invitation to the Vikings to sail in, haul their longships two miles overland from Arrochar to Tarbet, relaunch in Loch Lomond and sack the shore and island settlements. Nor did they have to retrace to Loch Long after their raids, since they could navigate down the Leven, regain the Clyde below Dumbarton Rock, and join the main licet for the Battle of Largs where retribution was meted out to them.\nIt would be illuminating to know what the human population around Loch Lomond was like in those Viking times. It would be even more so if we could look back another 5000 years to the sight that met the eyes of the first Stone Age men to paddle their dug-out canoes on the loch, bows and arrows at flic ready, against human enemies or dangerous animals.\nPerhaps these Baltic colonists numbered only a few dozen. Certainly they settled at Balmaha, at Luss and at Inchlonaig as we know from the stone tools they left behind. Probing forward would be a cautious affair, with 27.45 square miles of water and 3-5 islands to explore. The woods would be dangerous, with brown bears roaming, and wolves preying on elk and reindeer. The tree-line would be much higher than we know now, and the red deer would be larger and more heavily-antlered animals than those of today.\nWhy is Loch Lomond so narrow and ravine-like in the north and so wide at its southern base? The answer is in the rock structure. The unyielding Highland schists would not be pushed apart, so the compressed and moving mass of ice dug deep since it couldn\u2019t expand. This is why the bed of the loch is 600 feet below sea-level between Tarbet and Inversnaid. But when the 2000 feet thick bull-dozer of ice got to Ross Point it met softer rocks and was able to push them aside and spread out. The islands of the south, which are the glory of Loch Lomond, are the gritty masses which withstood the passage of the ice.\nOne fish reflects the ice-age past, the powan, called the freshwater herring because it looks so much like one. The theory is that this plankton- eating white fish was forced to adapt to a freshwater existence when the land level rose with the removal of the great weight of ice as it melted. Thus, when the salt water hollow of Loch Lomond became fresh the powan adapted to its new way of life by spawning in the part of the year closest to Arctic conditions\u2014 midwinter.\nPowan are the commonest fish in the loch and are good to eat when freshly caught, but to get them you have to use a net since, being plankton eaters, they rarely accept a fishing line. Pike, on the other hand, give good sport, the British record being a Loch Lomond fish that weighed 47 lb. n oz. The roach reaches its northern limit here, but for the game fisherman the real challenge are the salmon and pink-fleshed sea trout which enter the streams from the loch to spawn.\nNo other Scottish loch can list so many species of fish as Loch Lomond with sea lamprey, lampern, brook lamprey, brook trout, minnow, perch, loach, eel, three-spined and ten-spined stickleback, roach and flounder. Small wonder that the odd individual has been able to support himself on catches from the loch.\nOne of the special pleasures of living on Lomondside is that there is no end to discovery. Look at the colour photograph of the Fairy Loch. How many people have been to this enchanted spot, easily visited from a roadside ruin a mile north of Inverbeg ? After a steep climb up the burn you enter a reedy recess with a lochan so enchantingly beautiful that you can almost believe the story that the fairies put their special dye into it.\nOr what about the Black Village on the steep hillside above Stuckgowan House Hotel ? Follow the drystane dyke uphill then climb obliquely left where the dyke makes a right-angled turn. The ruins look across to the white house of Cuilness and the sharpest impression of Ben Lomond. The people who lived on this lovely shelf high above the loch died in a plague.\nMotorists should take the chance of visiting Loch Sloy, by stopping-off at Inveruglas and asking for a permit to use the high-climbing hydro-electric road.\n\u201cLoch Sloy \u201d was the war cry of the McFarlanes, and their pipe tune was appropriate to them, Togail nam Bo \u2014 the lifting of cattle. The rocky corrie encircling the loch was their gathering place. This wild clan were not mere reivers, but took honours at Flodden, at Pinkie, and they saved the day at the Battle of Langside. Like the MacGregors their name was outlawed for a time. Some were exiled in Strath \u2018Aan and took the name of Allan or MacAllan. According to Seton Gordon their descendants are still distinguished by their Highland courtesy.\nLoch Sloy is in greater use today than at any time since it was built at the end of the war, and produces electricity seven days a week, not just at peak load. Up there, one inch of rain produces one million units of electricity as the water rushes through the mountain by tunnel to discharge to the power house through four big ugly pipes which should have been landscaped years ago. Ten years ago there was talk of converting it to a pumped storage system like Ben Cruachan, but, if the plans for Craig Rostan go ahead, we are to have two power schemes facing each other across the narrow loch.\nIn peace, perchance to dream.\nJohn did not write his poem from the standpoint of a selfish man who wants the Craig Rostan shore to himself. Far from it. He was a weekender himself until he retired from being an executive engineer in the Post Office in 1967 and found this place. Few men over 60 would have moved from Glasgow into a house badly in need of attention, since it meant hauling everything he needed across the loch by boat.\nJohn would list his pleasures over the last nine years of retirement as having time to listen, look and observe the pattern of thee year in very beautiful spot with three levels of appeal\u2014the water, the natural woodlands and the rugged hillsides, each of them offering big rewards for very little effort. He has got to know Cuilness in the way I try to know my own homestead country around Gartocharn.\nExcept that he has gone further\u2014 by becoming a practical conservationist for the benefit of others. Take the boat to Inversnaid for the magical walk to Cuilness and you will find the path gets better and better as you go down. Where there used to be head-high bracken there is now springy turf. Burns that can be difficult have aids to make crossing them easier. In discreet corners there are grassy flats that are invitations to campers.\nThere is also a little message or two for those who can read and take a subtle hint. How\u2019s this for a hint?\nThey keep down mice and Marauding dogs.\nPregnant ewes are Not used to youse. Be considerate.\nChanges go on all the time on Loch Lomondside. The latest is the new Alexandria by-pass, which misses out Balloch and sweeps from a height down on Duck Bay for a superb first impression of the broad loch with Ben Lomond dominating the islands over a wide sweep of open water.\nThe old shore road is a layby now, providing ample grass space for people to picnic and enjoy the sight of water-skiers and power-boats.\nLoch Lomond, considering all the pressures put upon it, remains a modern miracle as well as a place vital to our future economy, since one foot of depth supplies 5000 million gallons of water for drinking and industrial purposes. Yet you would never know it was a reservoir, thanks to good planning and the unobtrusive intake pipes 250 yards out from the pumping station at Ross Priory. Who would know that the level of the loch is controlled by barrage gates on the Leven?\nToday Loch Lomond is valued and used by more folk than ever before. Managing them is beyond the scope of the landowners. We have still to find the right balance between preservation, conservation and exploitation. At the end of the day the wondrous beauty of Loch Lomond is a public responsibility in which all of us must play a part.\nYou can read more of Tom Weir\u2019s escapades here, where a new column is published online every Friday.",

    "text": "One of the fundamental shortcomings of the empirical psychological literature on mental disorders, personality aspects, intelligence, or emotions is that there is a lack of depth regarding the discussion what these psychological constructs are. Researchers often use statistical models such as factor models and find 3 depression factors or 5 personality factors, but it remains entirely unclear what these factors represent. I have written about this in more detail here regarding the psychopathology literature for which this challenge is especially severe.\nI was asked recently by the Editor of Health Psychology Review to write a commentary on a paper by Peters & Crutzen entitled \u201cPragmatic Nihilism: How a Theory of Nothing can Help Health Psychology Progress\u201d (URL). While the paper covers a few interesting ideas, it was somewhat consistent with the majority of the psychological literature in ignoring prior discussion on what psychological constructs are.\nMany scholars have raised two related questions: what are psychological constructs such as cognitions, emotions, attitudes, personality characteristics, and intelligence? And how are they best modeled statistically? This commentary provides (1) an overview of common theories and statistical models, (2) connects these two domains, and (3) discusses how the recently proposed framework pragmatic nihilism (Peters & Crutzen, 2017) fits in.\nFigure 1. Schematic visualization of three types of statistical models for psychological constructs (PC). Left: reflective model where the latent variable (thick border) \u201cPC\u201d is the common cause for the ten observed indicators 1-10 (thin borders). Center: formative model where the latent variable is constructed from the indicators. Right: network model where the co-occurrence of all observed items is due to causal processes; there is no latent variable, and self-loops indicate that items cause each other over time.\nBoth the paper by Peters & Crutzen, and my commentary, were discussed by the clinical psychology blog Mad in America, and I hope they will spark other interesting debates.\nFried, E.

My thanks to Bianca Reisdorf for assistance with the analysis, and Teresa Hanley for her valued comments.\nWorldwide diffusion and use of the Internet is changing how we communicate, but also reconfiguring patterns of local and global communication \u2014 shaping what we know, and whom we know. Rather than undermining social networks and local communities in the ways feared by many critics of new media, use of the Internet is empowering \u2018networked individuals\u2019 and their communities \u2013 local and global. This general theme is based on a synthesis of empirical research, and analysis of data gathered on the use of the Internet by people living in Britain and around the world. Longer-term outcomes will depend on how networked individuals and institutions will use the Internet in a rapidly evolving regulatory context that could enrich or undermine digital Britain.\nThe paper is posted and available on SSRN at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1673426 Comments would be valued, as I expect to have an opportunity to revise this following a meeting at the Rowntree Foundation.",

    "text": "William connects a simple vent van to a solar panel.\nMonosun also sells solar water heaters.\nYet at the same time, the dawning of a \u201csolar power revolution\u201d is upon us, as more and more individuals and companies around the planet come to realise that renewable energy is a \u201cno brainer\u201d, whether in respect to the environment or investment.\nHere The Phuket News speaks with William Mono, owner of the island\u2019s leading solar company Mono Sun Technology, about solar power in Phuket, and Thailand.\nWhat are some of the trends with solar power in Phuket and the general region?\nMore and more residents and businesses are installing grid-connect systems, which feed the solar power back into the grid, and can theoretically roll back your meter. Whereas in the past we mostly installed stand-alone systems on remote islands, for instance, out in the sticks where there wasn\u2019t grid power, and the client needed to depend on battery systems. But now, I\u2019d say just in the past two years, 90% of our work has been grid-connect systems, in your ordinary residential neighbourhoods and at private homes.\nIs there still a demand for stand-alone systems?\nThere is still some demand for stand-alone systems, especially for clients off the grid, but such systems can be a little more cost-prohibitive because of the element of battery systems whereas grid-connect systems don\u2019t require a battery as you draw your electricity directly from the grid, which is essentially your battery. But even on many of the islands off Phuket, they\u2019re running off large diesel generators already, so they\u2019re more seeking hybrid systems to reduce their fuel consumption.\nWith grid-connect systems, there\u2019s a safety element that will shut off the power generation if the power goes out. This is necessary so workers don\u2019t get electrocuted when working on the grid. There are hybrid systems for clients who require back-up when the power goes out, but technically these aren\u2019t 100 per cent \u201clegal\u201d and have yet to be certified by the PEA.\nWhat\u2019s the return on investment (ROI) like for a solar system these days?\nAs costs for solar panels and equipment have drastically fallen, so has the ROI period. Whereas in the past, it could have been 10 to 20 years before you broke even, depending on the system, now you\u2019re looking at only 5-6 years, without subsidies, or only 3-4 years with subsidies. The systems will last 30 years plus, and we can offer warrantee guarantees of 25 years. So it\u2019s really a no brainer when you crunch the numbers. One example was for a large-scale system quote we did for a factory in Phuket. About 10 years ago, the client was looking to go solar, and the system they would have needed would have cost US$5 million, or upwards of B200 million at the time. Now, for the same sized system, with newer equipment would only be about B18 million. It depends on the size of the system too. Generally, the larger the system, the cheaper rate per kilowatt and thus shorter ROI period.\nSo Monosun can advise residents, businesses and organisations who want to invest in solar?\nIndeed, in addition to our regular residential and commercial clientele throughout Phuket and the rest of the kingdom, we\u2019re currently consulting with a local organisation about the prospect of constructing a large solar plant that would help curb Phuket\u2019s rising demand for energy, which mostly comes from coal and oil power plants off the island. Solar is definitely a viable and smart solution for Phuket\u2019s power issues, which will continue to grow as the demand rises as much as 10 per cent annually.\nAre there any buy-back programmes in Phuket right now?\nCurrently there aren\u2019t any new programmes for the residential sector. In the past, there\u2019ve been at least two types of incentives offered to the general public. More than a decade ago, they started with a buy-back programme for Very Small Power Producers (VSPP), which enabled those with a contract to sell excess power \u2013 that which they didn\u2019t use \u2013 back to the grid. In practice, most [VSPP contractees] didn\u2019t produce excess power, as you\u2019d need a fairly large power system to have excess. The latest incentive applied a \u201cfeed-in tariff\u201d (FIT) model, which stipulated that you sell all the power you generate back to the PEA \u2013 all of it, so you wouldn\u2019t use any of it. Under this programme, the government agreed to buy electricity at a subsidized rate of nearly B7 per kilowatt-hour, whereas the normal rate is only about B4.75. But they reached their quota already and stopped issuing contracts a few months back.\nAre there any government incentive programmes for private individuals or investors now?\nThe government recently launched a programme inviting private investors to invest in solar systems that would be installed on government land. Under this scheme, the investor would get a certain return from the sale of electricity, and the government unit which operates that land would also get a cut for their own coffers. If anyone is interested in the details, we\u2019re happy to consult and can serve as the go between. Just give us a call or email us.\nWhile renewable energy sources are what the future holds, none are financially practical now.\nAn ROI of 3-5 years on solar is only a dream.  At this time, solar-geo-wind provide no 100% payback of the start up and operational costs.\nSome day, sure.  Today, not a chance.",

    "text": "Great job Holly, now let's get out of there fast!\nDig away from the commotion and out of the way of those Rock Tombs. Stay underground for the whole round and try your best to draw as little attention as possible, letting that angry mob focus on the Skorupi chucking rocks everywhere.\nHolly bends down, turning her claws against the ground instead of her opponent. Serqet's eyes narrow--she's seen this before, and Holly's not getting away with it this time! The skorupi sweeps her claws up, summoning a cluster of rocks from beneath the ground. The dig their way up through the sand and burst up into open air, hovering in a cluster around Serqet. With an abrupt forward gesture from the skorupi they tumble through the air towards Holly, who by now is knee-deep in a hole and tearing it ever deeper with her claws. The charmander grunts as the rocks topple down over her, burying her in a small pyramid of stone. There's nothing to prevent her from simply digging out from under the rock tomb, though, so that's what she does, continuing her downward tunneling until she's several feet underground.\nNow safe both from her opponent and the mob of angry pok\u00e9mon up above, Holly turns to digging horizontally with vague thoughts of making it back to the pyramid. On the surface, Serqet's facing a familiar dilemma: stay where she is, or try to go after Holly? It would be nice to keep an eye on where the charmander is this time, even though she won't be able to summon a rock tomb in the confines of a subterranean. What really seals the decision, though, is the continued unfriendly glaring from the pok\u00e9mon gathered around her--and is it just her, or do they seem to have come a little closer than when she last checked?\nThe skorupi scrambles up the side of the small rock pile and wriggles her way in between the haphazardly-piled stones, breaking through into Holly's tunnel below. Serqet trots off, following the glow of Holly's flame up ahead. Meanwhile, the charmander keeps on digging, oblivious to the skorupi creeping down the tunnel after her. She pauses at one point, and Serqet freezes, like that might somehow prevent her from being noticed if Holly turned around. But Holly was merely stopping as her reflect shield fluctuated, flashed, and finally collapsed entirely.\nThe fight has moved completely outside the pyramid. Both pok\u00e9mon are underground, a little past the row of stalls lining the road running by the pyramid. At the outlet of the tunnel is a small pile of rock, and gathered around that a group of rather hostile pok\u00e9mon, not yet convinced the troublemakers are gone for good.\n- Since it's been more than three rounds since Holly's scary face, its effects are beginning to wear off. Serqet will regain one level of speed every round.\nHolly, turn around and flush him out with a Fire Blast. I know it's not usually our most reliable move, but in a tunnel that's only you-sized, there shouldn't be much room to miss. If Serqet digs out of your line of sight, switch to Hone Claws. If she's brave enough to stand the heat, though, let's give it to her.\nSorry for how long this took, guys. I know I've got a good week left before DQ, but I still hate to have taken so long. I'll be better.\nSerqet probably isn't going to get a better opportunity to attack than now, with Holly's reflect fallen. The skorupi forces herself to gather courage and energy alike, despite her reservations. It's difficult to get a proper rock tomb going in the close confines of the tunnel; Serqet can't really tumble rocks down over Holly's head, although she does manage to make a couple drop on her from the ceiling. Boulders pile up around Holly, but most of them bump her rather than slamming into her the way they should. Certainly the attack leaves the charmander with enough verve to summon a fire blast--an actual fire blast, Serqet thinks in terrified wonderment as she tries to scuttle away from the glowing ball of fire. There's not a lot of room to maneuver in the cramped tunnel, and when the skorupi feels a great burst of heat she naturally braces herself for pain, thinking she's been hit--but no. The fiery arms of the fire blast pass just to either side of her, leaving her rattled but unhurt.\nIt can't last, though. Serqet summons another wave of rocks, but Holly shoves her way around the pile after only a few seconds, mouth half open and fire glowing deep in her throat. This time the fire blast hits, hurling Serqet against the tunnel wall and wrapping her in a sheet of flame. The skorupi screeches and rolls side to side until the fire's out, but she's still scorched painful black, a faint rattling noise emanating from her crisped armor as she raises shaking claws towards Holly, summoning rocks again.\nSerqet lies on her back after another fire blast hits home, wrecked carapace smoking and legs twitching. She can't take more fire, she simply can't--but she knows what Holly has in store. The charmander herself, bruised but clearly more excited than anything, is smoking, too--but from her overexerted throat, not any injury, and her wide, bright eyes shine in anticipation of her first victory.\nThe fight has moved completely outside the pyramid. Both pok\u00e9mon are underground, a little past the row of stalls lining the road running by the pyramid. The underground tunnel is choked with large rocks. At the outlet of the tunnel is a small pile of rock, and gathered around that a group of rather hostile pok\u00e9mon, not yet convinced the troublemakers are gone for good.\n- There isn't enough room for Serqet to summon a proper rock tomb inside the tunnel, so damage from the attack was reduced and the usual speed drop eliminated.\n- The accuracy of fire blast was increased slightly because Serqet didn't have much room to dodge, but the first one missed anyway.\n- Kung Fu Ferret next.\nAlright Holly, let's finish this off. One Flamethrower should be enough to take out Serqet, so after that, you should just be able to Chill and get some energy back. If Serqet's still up after one attack though, let's keep going until she's down.\nIt takes both courage and a furious effort of will for Serqet to flip herself over again, which provides her with a nicely upright view of Holly preparing more fire. The charmander's tail-flame blazes high, and light glows at the back of her throat, but Serqet steels herself and rushes forward anyway. Her claws rip across Holly's stomach, leaving a dark streak behind them in the air, but a second later the charmander opens up with a flamethrower and Serqet can't keep herself upright anymore.\nAlright buddy, start off with a Sunny Day! Follow up with some clones to keep yourself safe, and then let\u2019s let loose with an Energy Ball!\nSerqet disappears in a flash of red light, and Holly sits back with a pleased huff of air, letting smoke drift lazily from her nostrils. She won! And she's barely even hurt, just a little tired.\nBefore the charmander can really savor her victory, though, a wave of warmth passes over her, and then she's recalled, leaving the tunnel completely empty.\nBack in the pyramid, Kung Fu Ferret and Gzhoom stare eath other down. Who's going to move first? In the end the answer turns out to be \"both of them,\" as Gzhoom grabs a pok\u00e9ball off his belt as soon as he sees Kung Fu Ferret going for one. Two new pok\u00e9mon appear in twin flashes of light. On Kung Fu Ferret's side of the field, Kuzenbo takes a slow look around the arena, a perplexed expression on his face--then again, that's how he always look. Gzhoom's choice, Notorious, a lanky, muscular passimian, beats his chest and howls, psyching himself up for the battle to come. Kuzenbo turns his blank stare on his opponent, but if he has any reaction to the passimian's hooting display, he gives no sign.\n- Super pumped for battle.\nNotorious raises his berry high, and and it shines a brilliant white too searing to look at, the energy the passimian poured into it waking a similar brightening of the sun outside. But when the berry's light flickers and dies, the pok\u00e9mon can hardly feel the effects of the increased sunlight, shielded as they are by the mass of ancient architecture around them.\nThe bright sun defintely doesn't seem to be getting Kuzenbo down. The psyduck stares blankly at Notorious a moment, then abruptly opens his bill and sprays the passimian with super-cooled water that freezes immediately on impact. Notorious growls, contemptuously shattering a hunk of ice clinging to his shoulder, then takes off running, galloping faster and faster around the perimeter of the pyramid until he starts to blur and appears to split into five identical passimian chasing each others' tails around and around the arena.\nKuzenbo turns slowly, trying to keep Notorious in his sights. He fires off another ice beam, soaking one of the passimian at random, but it simply vanishes when the water touches it. Notorious laughs giddily, then hurls his berry at Kuzenbo. It glows a brilliant green as it travels through the air, a burst of grass-type energy discharging with a fizz when it strikes the psyduck. Notorious expertly catches the berry on the rebound, running all the while, and Kuzenbo's retaliatory ice beam wipes out another clone. The passimian laughs and keeps going. This is too easy!\n- Exhilarated. Has two clones.\nThe battle's moved back inside the pyramid proper, where it's rather dusty and gloomy. Brilliant, hot sunlight shines in through cracks and places where bricks have been knocked out (6 more actions), but most of the arena remains in cool darkness.\n- I didn't think Notorious was fast enough to make five clones (*insert joke about Slowlolan pok\u00e9mon here*), so he got four instead.\n- Sunny day's effects are attenuated as a result of the sun being outside and everybody else being inside the pyramid. It increases fire-type damage by 1.15x and reduces water-type damage by 0.75x rather than the usual values.\nHey Negrek, I had a question about the calculations. I hope this is the right place to put it. When you added 2% to Ice Beam's damage for \"stat\", is that because Psyduck's SpAtk is higher than it's Atk? I figure that's what it is, because you subtracted 2% from Energy Ball, and Passimian's SpAtk is lower than its Atk.\nI was just wondering if that's the case before I finalize my commands. Thanks!\nThe +2 to ice beam is a combination of the modifier on Kuzenbo's special attack (+1) and on Notorious' special defense (-1), which works out to an overall +2.\nWhoa, that\u2019s a really neat way of working with stats. I haven\u2019t seen them worked into ASB before, and I really like it!\nIn that case, let\u2019s try out some Seed Bombs!\nNotorious chucks his berry at Kuzenbo again, and once more it glows green as it arcs through the air. It lands with more explosive force this time, though, a blast that both propels the berry back to its owner's paw and knocks Kuzenbo over on his back. Notorious whoops and dashes along, daring Kuzenbo to try and catch him.\nThe psyduck slowly rights himself, looking neither angry nor pained, and again begins turning, following Notorious with his bill. The air hums a moment with the buildup of psychic tension, both around Kuzenbo and around Notorious, and too late the passimian realizes the psyduck's picked him out from his clones. The low hum escalates to sudden, painful blaring, a migraine feeling like it might crack the passimian's skull. Notorious yelps, tripping and rolling unceremoniously into a wall, his clones vanishing behind him.\nThe passimian's almost as slow to rise as Kuzenbo was, groaning and rubbing his face. He turns around, snarling, to find the psyduck standing in exactly the same place, still wearing that goofy, utterly neutral expression. Notorious hurls his berry at the psyduck again, and another explosion knocks him down, but the psyduck rises again a moment later, mildly scorched but with unhchanged demeanor. The droning psychic attack that follows sends Notorious to his knees.\nAnother seed bomb, another psychic, and it seems neither pok\u00e9mon is gaining much ground over the other. Notorious definitely seems grimmer, teeth gritted and clutching his berry tight, but Kuzenbo appears unchanged, surrounded by scorch marks and small craters but as unruffled as ever.\nBrilliant, hot sunlight shines in through cracks and places where bricks have been knocked out (3 more actions), but most of the arena remains in cool darkness. The ground around Kuzenbo is scorched and scuffed up.",

The global company has four manufacturing sites within the UK, two of which are in Yorkshire, alongside their global head office.\nCroda makes the official commitment to pay the real Living Wage, an hourly wage of at least \u00a38.75 outside of London, to all employees working at Croda in the UK, including third-party contract staff. This is significantly higher than the government minimum wage of \u00a37.50 for 25-year olds and \u00a37.05 for those under 25.\nThe number of Living Wage Employers has doubled since 2016, the year the Government\u2019s National Living Wage was introduced. In 2017 alone, 1,200 employers became Living Wage accredited, a 20% increase on the previous year. Since the Living Wage campaign began, over 150,000 people have experienced a pay rise totalling \u00a3613m.",

    "text": "Dandelions disperse their seeds by wind.\nThis Science quiz is called 'Life Cycles - Plants' and it has been written by teachers to help you if you are studying the subject at elementary school. Playing educational quizzes is an enjoyable way to learn if you are in the 3rd, 4th or 5th grade - aged 8 to 11.\nThe life cycles of plants are the stages from seed to dispersal. In flowering plants the cycle goes like this: seeds in the soil germinate. They then grow roots and shoots. The next stage is a seedling which matures into an adult plant and makes flowers. Then the plant makes fruit which itself contains seeds. These are spread through dispersal and the cycle starts again. Did you know that some trees have lived for hundreds, or even thousands of years? One yew tree in Llangernyw, Wales, is believed to be at least 4,000 years old! Other plants, such as cress, only live for a few weeks.\nWhy do plants need sunlight?\nWhat do seeds need in order to germinate?\nWhich part of a flowering plant grows into a fruit?\nWhich of the following words describes the moment a seed begins to grow?\nWhich part of a flowering plant is male?\nFlowering plants produce many seeds which never grow. Why do they do this?\nWhich of the following plants disperses its seeds by wind?\nHave you ever blown the seeds from a dandelion clock?\nWhat happens if seeds are planted too closely together?",

It lies at the northern tip of the marshlands between the Tigris and Euphrates.\nDuring the eight-year Iran\u2013Iraq War, Amarah and the surrounding province became the site of several battles, notably Operation Before the Dawn launched by Iran. Since the Baghdad-Basra highway cut through the province, Iran targeted the area due to its strategic significance to the Iraqis.\nDuring the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the city made a final stand as a center of resistance to Saddam Hussein. The city was soon occupied by British forces, which set up two camps. Local residents hired diggers to unearth the bodies in the mass grave after twelve years. However, in June 2003, citizens of Amarah took up arms against patrolling British forces, killing six soldiers each in two separate attacks, south of the City in Majar Al Kabir. The British bases frequently experienced mortar attacks afterward. The books Sniper One by Sergeant Daniel Mills, Dusty Warriors by Richard Holmes and Barefoot Soldier by Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC all contain very good accounts on the events in Al Amarah during this period.\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 \"Al 'Amarah\".

    "text": "Paul Krugman on Twitter: \"Are people noticing that the Trump economic team is shaping up as a gathering of gold bugs?\"\nThe gold standard was invented to constrain government spending. Nations that agreed to exchange money for gold thought twice before printing more money. And lately, Republicans have found themselves yearning for such restraint.\nThe gold standard is a topic that, for reasons that Ip notes, is likely to recur during the presidential primaries and general election. It is a complicated one and one which it really is valuable to get the nuances right. And it fully deserves return to the mainstream.\nHis third element is sound money, which, he said at Boulder, would \u201cideally\u201d mean a dollar tied to gold. That would make it harder to fund a socialist government, reduce the need for vast financial hedging, and focus investment in productive directions.\n\"The COMEX gold futures market in New York and the Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades cleared through the London Bullion Market Association do set prices which are followed most widely in the world. They are also markets dominated by a handful of huge players, the six London Bullion Market Association gold clearing banks \u2014 the corrupt JP MorganChase bank; the scandal-ridden UBS bank of Zurich; The Bank of Nova Scotia \u2014 ScotiaMocatta, the world's oldest bullion bank which began as banker to the British East India Company, the group that ran the China Opium Wars; the scandal-ridden Deutsche Bank; the scandal-ridden Barclays Bank of London; HSBC of London, the house bank of the Mexican drug cartels; and the scandal and fraud-ridden Societe Generale of Paris,\" Engdahl narrated.\nDeutsche Bank AG Tuesday raised its outlook for gold and silver prices in 2013 and 2014, citing support from stimulus measures by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nThe bank raised its 2013 gold forecast by 3% to $2,113 a troy ounce and its 2014 outlook by 11.1% to $2,000/oz. Next year, the price of gold could exceed $2,200/oz, it said.\nSimilarly, Deutsche Bank increased its 2013 outlook on silver by 3% to $44/oz and its 2014 forecast by 11.1% to $40/oz.\nA major support for precious metal prices are the recent moves by central banks to expand their balance sheet, said the bank. Since gold is often sought as a hedge against currency weakness and inflation at times of loose monetary policy, such moves tend to boost its appeal to investors.\n\"We believe central bank action to stimulate growth, avoid deflation and reduce systemic risk is unambiguously bullish for the precious metals sector and specifically gold,\" said Michael Lewis, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\"While we have targeted gold prices moving above $2,000/oz since the beginning of 2011, we believe the Fed's open-ended program of QE announced last month increases our confidence that a surge in the gold price above this level is only a matter of time,\" he added.\nOne of the most commonly held beliefs among gold investors is that the market for gold is heavily manipulated.\nIs Russia Moving to a Gold-Backed Currency?\nRussia is probably not going to issue a gold-backed currency. It's not going to overtake the U.S. economically in any way. However, the Russians can set a good example of smarter economic policies moving forward for some of the other big players such as China and Japan. That includes exchanging U.S. government debt for gold.\nFrench paper Le Parisien didn\u2019t mince words in the headline: \u201cLa chasse au cash est lancee\u201d. Basically \u2018hunting season on cash is launched\u2019.\nBarely months after gold import rules were eased, the government is looking to re-impose curbs as the country's insatiable appetite has led to a surge in the yellow metal coming into India, threatening to undermine the improvement in external balances.\nThe trade deficit worsened to an 18-month high of $14 billion in September following a 450% rise in gold imports as importers rushed to take advantage of lower prices. \"Gold imports have risen since the norms were relaxed.\nAre We Going To See Massive Confiscation Of Wealth By Banks!?\nRussia and China need to ensure their gold and currency reserves are secure, Russia's President Vladimir Putin told foreign journalists at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin plans to open the door to Chinese money as U.S. and European sanctions over Ukraine threaten to tip the economy into recession, according to two senior government officials.\nThe Chinese won\u2019t be welcome in all areas: Russia plans to set \u201cred lines\u201d around significant gold, platinum-group metals, diamond mining and high-technology projects, the officials said.",

We've done Triangle before and don't necessarily love the course, and we've never done Mission Man, which everyone says is really nice. We are both able to race because we have a babysitter coming over at 5am!\nNext weekend I'm trying to decide if I want to do The Battle at Buckhorn, and try to win my first belt buckle, or just stay local (very local, like 1/2 mile away local) and do the Roundabout 5K with Marty and Logan. I've never raced Buckhorn before; one year I was going to but one of Marty's athletes tore her shoulder labrum and couldn't do the swim, so I did that portion for her so she could still compete. Marty has won 3 belt buckles from this race, which are on our mantel. It's quite a unique award! But I would have to go over solo and I'm not sure I want to do that.\nThe following weekend I'm doing the Lake Logan Olympic distance race - one of my faves. It's on Saturday, and Marty will be doing the sprint or the aquathon on Sunday. Logan gets to go to both...we'll see how that goes!\nLogan says hi, bright and early this morning!",

    "text": "Professional teeth whitening is preferred over Over-the-Counter (OTC) teeth whitening systems because it is performed under the supervision of a dental professional. This is important because ill-fitting whitening trays can allow the gel to leak out from underneath the tray, which will irritate the gums and can lead to permanent gingival recession.\nProfessional teeth whitening will also achieve a brighter smile in a shorter amount of time because a higher percentage of the whitening agent can be used. The whitening gel also contains a buffer, which helps protect the enamel of the teeth.\nTeeth whitening remains one of the most economical ways to enhance your smile. A brighter smile gives the impression of youth, vitality, happiness, and warmth. It is often perceived as a sign of health and is one of the first things that people notice when they meet.\nAt The Smile Center Orlando, our professional teeth whitening program consists of a 1-hour in-office treatment followed by supervised at-home treatments for up to 3 weeks. During the initial in-office treatment, the gums are blocked out with a special material to limit irritation and then three whitening sessions are performed to achieve brighter teeth. Each patient is then given custom-made whitening trays to continue using at-home. These trays can be worn for 30 to 60 minutes per day for up to 3 weeks or until the desired color you are looking for is achieved.",

    "text": "IBM\u00ae Business Process Manager is a middleware suite that enables managed execution of the processes that keep your business running. It includes a graphical authoring environment that is used for modeling processes and a sophisticated runtime engine that is capable of integrating workflow for the people and automated systems that comprise your organization.\nEvery day IBM Business Process Manager customers use their IT infrastructure to deliver business value at a fast pace. However, as with any complex system, care must be taken to define performance objectives appropriate to the solution and to ensure that those objectives are met. The IBM Redbooks\u00ae publication IBM Business Process Manager V8.5 Performance Tuning and Best Practices, SG24-8216, provides the details necessary to ensure a high performance business process management project. This IBM Redbooks Solution Guide provides an overview of the most critical topics from that book.\nThis IBM\u00ae Redbooks\u00ae Solution Guide provides valuable information for IBM Business Process Manager application development architects and technical leaders. It describes a holistic approach to performance issues that range from establishing initial goals and application design through the implementation phase and finally to long-term application maintenance and planning for future capacity. These tasks require a coordinated effort for all of the teams involved in a complex project to ensure that performance objectives can be met. These teams include business owners, infrastructure architects, database administrators, and test leaders. This solution guide serves as a reference to establish these conversations early and to make sure that all critical topics are covered. The typical application development lifecycle for IBM Business Process Manager follows a model described in Figure 1.\nThe performance architect is ultimately responsible for the performance of the solution from end to end and drives performance objectives throughout the application development lifecycle.\nThe business analyst is responsible for providing accurate non-functional requirements for the project.\nApplication development architects are responsible for designing solutions that are capable of meeting the non-functional requirements.\nApplication developers are responsible for following preferred practices and for avoiding anti-patterns.\nThe test team lead or manager, together with the performance architect, is responsible for test case design and for translating the non-functional service level agreements (SLAs) that are received from the business analyst into concrete performance objectives.\nTesters and script developers are responsible for building and debugging the measurement harness that simulates the user activity as required for driving the tests.\nTest team members are responsible for executing the measurements and for collecting the resource consumption data that explains the results.\nThe infrastructure team, including the system administrator, is responsible for IT monitoring.\nThe database administrator is responsible for database tuning and monitoring.\nOf course, these roles can vary from one organization to another, and, in some cases, the same person or team of people might fulfill multiple roles.\nAs a business process development and execution platform, IBM Business Process Manager manages business transactions across a wide variety of industries and functional domains. Even within a single organization, some business processes can constitute straightforward orchestration of a set of web service calls, and other processes coordinate the activities of complex teams of knowledge workers. Clearly, the lifecycle of a process instance can vary dramatically from one business process to another. Similarly, the performance characteristics of one process application can be quite different from those of another. The key to a successful production deployment is to match the actual behavior of the application to the requirements of the business.\nWith every new IBM Business Process Manager release, performance engineers optimize the code to ensure it can support the most strenuous throughput and response time objectives. However, success is measured in the experience of business users when a new application is deployed into production. To achieve success, the Business Process Manager code must work together with the process application, the services it integrates, and the infrastructure on which it runs. This work begins as soon as the new application is conceived and continues through the performance verification cycle.\nOne set of challenges common to all system-wide concerns, such as performance, is communication and collaboration across the organizational lines within a business. Separation of responsibility among business leaders, application development teams, infrastructure teams, and database management teams is a common practice and does lead to crisp definition of ownership. However, achieving success on system metrics requires a degree of nimbleness in working across these boundaries. Occasionally, we see progress delayed because of formal structures that result in a period of waiting, for example if an application development team needs to request a configuration change within a database server or if a database administrator needs additional physical resources (processor, memory, or storage) allocated to a database server.\nThe most common costs of poor application performance are easy to imagine. Business users might experience slow response times from their user interface. The slow response time leads to dissatisfaction, which can threaten the overall adoption of new applications. Similarly, miscalculation of the performance metrics of a fully-automated application can lead to resource exhaustion (processor or memory), which might threaten the stability of the entire system. When a process application spans multiple business units, the consequences of a resource failure can be substantial.\nAlthough establishing and verifying non-functional requirements early in the development cycle can add to the cost of application development, failing to do so can be even more expensive. Redesigning an application to meet performance objectives after the fact often requires removal or replacement of substantial amounts of code, exposing the project to wasted effort. Building performance objectives into every phase of application development pays off in the long run through reduced risk of system failure and reduced maintenance cost. Also, applications that are well tuned and well measured are less likely to require over provisioning of hardware, which might reduce software licensing costs.\nNow, let us describe IBM Business Process Manager performance measurement and analysis activities by breaking them down among the application development lifecycle from initial requirements gathering through long-term maintenance and capacity planning.\nJust as the functional requirements for a business process management solution originate with the business community who will be using the application and are refined and validated through early discussion and playback, so are performance requirements for the application. Make sure to use the opportunity presented through the regular cadence of playback meetings to gather information about the performance expectations that the business community brings to requirements gathering process. Starting early has the advantage that it forces the Performance Architect to think about the objectives in terms of the end to end business experience from the outset. Often times, it is tempting to think of performance objectives one component at a time. However, it is much easier to build a comprehensive performance plan and gather consensus across all of the teams that will contribute to its execution when the objectives can be described based on end to end scenarios that the Business Analyst and, ultimately, Business Sponsor of the project, understands well and can discuss easily.\nAs a performance architect and engineer, you can help business users articulate their expectations using metrics that are easy to validate within the performance lab. These expectations allow an initial performance plan for the project to be generated at the same time that the functional test plan is generated. Experience shows that some metrics, such as page load response time for a user interface element, are easy for business users to visualize and discuss. Alternatively, some metrics of extremely high value to the performance analyst, such as total system throughput, are more difficult to discuss. Try to conduct these conversations in a context that is natural to the business. Try to avoid talking about the average number of times a particular API invocation occurs per second. Instead, start with the number of mortgage applications (or whatever business process you are modeling) processed per month, the total number of teams that need to contribute to the processing, and the relative sizes of those teams. After these numbers are established, it is easier to guide the conversation to a discussion of the load that they system might expect during a peak hour.\nFocus on establishing performance objectives that accurately reflect the needs of the business. Although it is usually easy to understand the risks that are associated with under estimating the performance objectives, over estimating the objectives can be just as detrimental to the overall success of the project. For example, a response time objective of 1 or 2 seconds for a particular user interface element might be perfectly reasonable. Increasing the objective to 500 milliseconds might seem like an innocuous change and allow for some headroom \"just in case.\" However, in many cases, it is unlikely that this decrease in responsiveness would be of value to the application users, and the engineering costs of achieving this tighter tolerance might be high. Sometimes, through poor communication, additional headroom accumulates when establishing an objective (with each team building in its own buffer) to the point that the engineering ultimately does not match the business need.\nOver time, you should expect to notice patterns that will simplify the process of gathering requirements. For example, perhaps your organization will standardize on 2 second response times (measured at the 90th percentile) for all simple user interface elements, 5 seconds for complex elements, and custom response times only for exceptional operations. At this point, the response time conversation becomes the simpler activity of identifying the complex and exceptional interactions with the system. Similar patterns might emerge for the throughput metrics. Look for them, and use them to your advantage. Perhaps the business users will not have a good idea of the throughput requirements for a totally new application, but they suspect that it might be similar to rates that they are already observing in another application (perhaps that you collaborated on in the past). Beginning the performance requirements conversations early allows those requirements (and the likelihood that they will be met) to be tracked as application developments and playbacks proceed. If performance requirements will force changes in application design or implementation, surfacing those early in the development cycle benefits everybody.\nUltimately, the performance requirements gathering process will result in a performance plan that describes the metrics of importance, the goals or objectives that the application should achieve for each metric and a description of the simulation infrastructure required to evaluate the application. Simulation for some metrics is straightforward. Single user response time measures can be evaluated using a common user interface (like a web browser) by a person with a stopwatch executing the test manually. More extensive load tests required to evaluate throughput objectives for IBM Business Process Manager applications require a large scale simulation capable of generating http traffic. Tools, such as JMeter, IBM Rational\u00ae Performance Tester, and LoadRunner, are usually used to fulfill this role. Also, because most IBM Business Process Manager user interface applications communicate with the server via a series of REST interactions, it is possible to construct a stand-alone Java application that simulates server load. In every case, it is important to execute the performance measurements against server hardware that matches that to be used in production environment as closely as possible. Planning early can ensure that hardware is available when needed.\nBecause most business process management solutions are complex systems made up of many parts that must work well together to meet functional and non-functional requirements, an architectural approach to performance measurement and analysis is important. Decomposing the system into its components makes analysis easier simply because small things are easier to understand than large ones. End-to-end measurement is critical to ensure that the system works well as a whole when all of the components are working together. In this section, we look at a few architectural techniques that help.\nStart small and scale up. The requirements determination phase might have revealed that your application needs to support thousands of concurrent users starting and completing tens of thousands of business process instances per hour. This does not mean that your performance measurements (or stress and load tests) need to begin with this degree of load. You can learn a lot about your application through repeated measurement, tracing, and analysis of single user scenarios. When these are working as expected, measurements with a small concurrent population will help to verify your load simulation infrastructure and also the scaling capabilities of your new application. Data gathered from measurements with small populations and load will help to predict the results you will see under heavier load and help with verification of the actual measurements. Furthermore, small scale measurements are cheaper and easier to implement, allowing them to be executed earlier and more frequently in the development cycle and giving more time to react in the case that the application needs to be adapted.\nSimilar scale-up techniques apply to other parts of the infrastructure. When the performance plan calls for measurements against a large, complex IBM WebSphere\u00ae ND topology, it is a good idea to start with a smaller system, perhaps a single cluster member with a minimum hardware configuration. As analysis progresses, the system can grow to ensure that assumptions regarding vertical scalability (increasing the number of processing cores per cluster member) and horizontal scalability (increasing the number of cluster members) are met.\nPay attention to the interfaces, especially where the business process management application interacts with external services, such as a web services endpoint. Concurrency or throughput limitations in a service provider frequently limit the performance characteristics of the entire solution. Because web service traffic is relatively easy to simulate (compared with human generated traffic), it is natural to decompose an application at the service implementation boundaries to verify their capacity before re-composing the application for end to end measurements. Of course, when re-composing the application, don\u2019t forget to consider the glue that holds it all together--the network connections among the components themselves. A lean user interface that pulls data from a well-tuned backend server might still show poor responsiveness if the network connection between the two has high latency or limited capacity. It is especially important to design the physical topology of the solution to ensure good connection between the process designer and its process center and between a process server and its database server.\nBusiness process modeling plays an important role in the performance characteristics of a business process management application. Throughout the design and implementation phases of application development, options will arise that can have a significant impact on overall system performance. Chapter 3 of the IBM Redbooks publication, IBM Business Process Manager v8.5 Performance Tuning and Best Practices, SG24-8216, describes many common pitfalls and suggests alternatives. This section addresses the topic in a more philosophical manner, looking at some high level design choices and a generalized, data-driven methodology that we find useful during the implementation phase.\nIBM Business Process Manager is a flexible business process modeling and execution environment that offers a variety of structures to meet a variety of business needs. At its core, however, all business process management applications manage and persist the state of some business activity. Matching the execution and persistence model to the needs of the business provides an excellent opportunity to optimize for performance. For example, when constructing processes for the BPEL engine, application designers have a choice between short-running processes (microflows), with simple and efficient transactional characteristics, and long-running processes (macroflows), which are capable of coordinating the most complex transactional workloads. Data shows that the simpler state management model used for short-running processes allows execution at much higher throughput. Many processes allow for short-running execution in the common case, but need more complex handling for exceptional cases. So a compound implementation model fits these applications well. All process instances begin with microflow execution and many complete within that microflow. For exception processing, the microflow invokes a macroflow that models the more extensive processing that these instances require.\nSimilar considerations apply to designing for straight through processing. Computers execute work at a much faster rate than humans. However, business process management usually (and appropriately) begins with an analysis of human workflow. As the process is optimized over time, opportunities arise to automate activities that are carried out by human workers that can be more efficiently handled automatically. This analysis might lead to a shift from a human-centric application that is authored with Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) to a more automated application that is authored with Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) or a hybrid of the two that uses an Advanced Integration service to link the two. Because the engine that executes BPMN processes was optimized for handling human centric applications, it is not nearly as fast at executing fully automated workloads as the BPEL engine is. For this reason, it is best to build Straight Through Processing applications using BPEL to get the maximum resource utilization efficiency.\nApplying an iterative, data-driven performance measurement and analysis methodology is a great help in maximizing the efficiency of the performance optimization exercise. Many application development engineers have ideas that can improve the overall efficiency of an application. You can channel these enhancement ideas through a scientifically sound evaluation process. Establish a performance simulation environment early, and extend it as the capabilities of the application expand. This method allows early collection of performance baseline data, which is valuable in tracking application performance as new function is added. Measure the effect of one potential performance enhancement at a time in order to build confidence that the enhancement delivers the expected gain. If it does not, it might be abandoned. Sometimes, application development teams retain performance \"best practices\" that incur some development cost but that actually deliver minimal or no performance gain. Use resource monitoring data (such as CPU, memory, and network consumption statistics as well as tracing and thread dumps) to inform your search for new performance enhancements. It might not be worthwhile to pursue an improvement to an area of the application that consumes only 10% of the total resource consumed by the system. Finally, remember Alexander\u2019s Law: it is faster not to do something than to do it fast. Sometimes, there is just no need to include the expensive activity in the application at all.\nActual execution of performance measurement and analysis takes time, attention, and physical resources. Sometimes, due to lack of planning ahead of time, a dedicated hardware environment is not available for performance measurement and data collection activities. In these cases, performance activities might be executed on a physical environment that is shared with system integration test or on the production environment as it is being prepared for use. Each case presents challenges to successful execution of the Performance Plan.\nBy its nature, performance measurement and analysis are disruptive activities, making them unsuitable for sharing a system integration test environment with other activities. One goal of performance measurement is to drive the system under test to complete saturation of physical resources in order to measure maximum sustainable load. Similarly, sensitive response time measurements can be polluted by other test activities running on the machines at the same time. For this reason, it is common to see time-sharing policies used for sharing performance measurement hardware among multiple activities. Time sharing is better than simultaneous use but limits the rate at which progress can be made. Performance analysis is an iterative process, requiring painstaking attention to detail and changing only one parameter at a time. Time sharing reduces the total number of iterations that can be completed within a day.\nIn some cases, it appears better to execute pre-production performance measurement and analysis activities on the actual production hardware as it is being prepared for use. This might seem like a good idea because it is desirable that the performance test environment match the production environment as closely as possible. Using the same physical machines certainly delivers a good match in this regard. However, after the production environment is deployed to the business, it is no longer available for continued performance measurement activities. Continued measurement as new versions of the application are developed is critical for avoiding release to release regression. Continued measurement is also critical for long term capacity planning activities.\nFor these reasons, plan early for allocation of a dedicated performance measurement and analysis environment for use during initial application development and longer-term use.\nAs a business process state management system, IBM Business Process Manager applications make heavy use of their database, writing state to ensure it is preserved. Furthermore, IBM Business Process Manager allows a flexible infrastructure for describing business data to be stored with the business process and then retrieving those process instances from storage. From a database perspective, this means that IBM Business Process Manager applications are both read-intensive and write-intensive. Close collaboration between the business process management administrator and the database administrator is recommended, as performance analysis must be approached as an end-to-end activity, considering the entire system.\nTraditional database analysis using operating system and database tools to identify memory needs, I/O behavior, slow executing SQL statements and similar issues apply to business process management applications and work well. It is critical to ensure that the database server has sufficient physical memory available and that it is backed by a fast disk subsystem (RAID or SAN are common enterprise solutions). Optimization of database indexes is another important activity for the database administrator (DBA) and the business process management administrator to address. IBM Business Process Manager does create a comprehensive set of indexes at install time. However, because there is performance overhead associated with index maintenance, it only creates indexes that are beneficial to the majority of IBM Business Process Manager applications. Every application will benefit from additional index analysis and this analysis is often critical to get the best performance from a system. Again, an iterative approach works best \u2013 use your performance simulation and load test to identify long running SQL statements, use the database query plan advisor to identify indexes that might be beneficial and conduct measurements with and without these new indexes to evaluate their effectiveness, only accepting those that deliver the expected benefit.\nIn addition to the ongoing performance analysis and optimization that occurs during the application development cycle, most enterprises require formal performance verification, including a successful load test as one of the requirements before releasing the application to production. Executing this part of the plan requires simulating full production load (or perhaps greater than full production load) against a fully functional system that is running the application. However, this type of simulation does not mean that the first measurements must be executed at full load, even at the final verification stage. Returning to a small load and monitoring resource consumption as the load increases continues to be good practice and aids in discovery of performance tuning requirements or potential bottlenecks. Final verification should be executed on hardware that matches the production servers as closely as possible. This final verification applies to the servers that host external services and to the servers that host IBM Business Process Manager. In some cases, the final performance verification can call out to the actual production servers hosting web services endpoints, but this is often possible. In either case, the concurrency and throughput characteristics of the endpoints should match those of the production servers.\nIn addition to validation of the performance characteristics of the business process application, it is worth spending a moment to think about validation of the performance objectives themselves. One common issue observed in performance plans associated with IBM Business Process Manager applications is that the objectives are actually too high. How does this come about? Typically, performance engineers look at the user interface elements that make up a solution and design think times based on a reasonable person completing the form. Perhaps this form can be completed in 30 seconds. So the performance engineer builds a simulation with a think time of 30 seconds per human task completion. Next, the total user population is analyzed, and it is determined that the system needs to support a few thousands of concurrent users. Putting these two pieces together creates a performance plan that requires the system to support the completion of thousands of tasks and many hundreds of business process instances per minute. It is a good idea to validate the throughput implied by the performance objectives against actual business requirements in addition to the number of concurrent users. In some cases, performance verification exercises actually simulate several months\u2019 worth of business activity in a period of a few hours. When this is intended, it is a fantastic result; when unintentional, it can lead to some confusion.\nGood performance practice does not end when the application is released to production. The same resource monitoring tools and skills built up for performance evaluation during application development are extremely useful long term and should be a part of the IT monitoring practice for any enterprise application. Observation of patterns in CPU or memory utilization on IBM Business Process Manager and database servers can help identify approaching capacity issues before they become apparent to the business. In particular, collecting verbose garbage collection statistics (-verbose:gc on the Java command line) and using a graphical visualization tool (such as PMAT: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=22d56091-3a7b-4497-b36e-634b51838e11) to inspect them is an inexpensive way to monitor the pulse of the application. Many IT departments depend on automated systems of monitoring key resources and sending alerts when thresholds are exceeded.\nLong-term performance health of a business process management solution requires a maintenance plan. The databases that contain operational data for IBM Business Process Manager are optimized for rapid execution of business process activities, not for long term retention and access of that data. So, it is recommended that a retention period be established for the data associated with business process instances that have completed. The actual amount of time that these completed instances need to be retained will vary from one business to another, but after that period expires, those instances should be removed from the server using the appropriate tools. Business monitoring tools, such as the Performance Data Warehouse and IBM Business Monitor, are optimized for processing this data for long-term storage and retrieval.\nAfter an application has been available in production for a while, a time will come when capacity planning is needed. Perhaps an application is popular and business users interact with it more frequently or the application is rolled out to a larger community. The experience gained from performance verification exercises and IT monitoring of the application in the production environment is the best input to planning future capacity. Resource consumption models usually follow predictable patterns, so it is often possible to project tomorrow\u2019s needs based on a thorough understanding of today\u2019s behavior. Also, many enterprises use their load test to ensure enough head room is available to provide a buffer against capital expenditures. Load testing at 150% of projected peak load gives some confidence that the system will be able to handle a growing business and might provide lead time in case additional capacity is required.\nA wholesale company provides an online parts sales operation where it handles direct orders that are placed by their business partners. Consider a business process application, MyAuditApp, whose goal is to review order data submitted by a business partner for correctness. After the review is complete, the order is sent to another application (perhaps an existing system, not implemented in IBM Business Process Manager) for processing. In this case, the audit process contains two stages. The first stage in the audit is relatively simple, is fully automated, and is required for all orders. The second stage is more complex and requires human oversight, but it is needed only if the first stage of the audit reveals a potential issue.\nPerformance objectives for the two stages of the application are distinct but are linked. This company knows that it needs to be able to process 30,000 orders per day, distributed throughout a 12-hour period, but with peaks of 4,000 orders in any given hour. These requirements establish a throughput objective for the overall application of about 1.1 process instances per second. To allow some head room, a formal performance objective of 1.5 process instances per second is established for the stage of the application that handles the automated processing.\nBecause the business knows that 90% of all orders are handled successfully by the automated stage of processing, a formal objective of 0.15 process instances per second is established for the manual stage of the application. In addition, the corporate standard of a 2-second response time for all UI elements (measured at the 90th percentile) is accepted for all stages of the processing, except for initial login and final submission of the audit completion form. These operations are expected to complete in 5 seconds (again, measured at the 90th percentile).\nEven though MyAuditApp is a single business process application implemented in IBM Business Process Manager, it clearly has two separate facets. So the performance analysis engineer decides to model the performance simulation as though it were two separate applications. The first half of the simulation is easy to construct. Because all the interactions are automated, perhaps with communication occurring via Java Message Service (JMS) and WebService interactions, software components can be written to drive the application using exactly the same interfaces that will be used in production. Furthermore, because this phase of processing is the most straightforward, the application development team decides to implement it first while requirements determination and initial playbacks of the human interface elements of the application take place. In this way, early performance analysis of the first stage of the application begins before the entire application is fully developed.\nPerformance simulation for the manual stage of MyAuditApp proceeds differently, because it must account for human interactions, which occur through a web browser and communicate with the IBM Business Process Manager server via REST interactions. Response time evaluation will be executed using the same corporate standard web browser that the business users will use. Evaluation of actual response times when interacting with the application will begin early in application development and will continue as new functionality is added. Any new function that regresses response times beyond acceptable limits will be re-engineered during the next development iteration to ensure that this type of work does not accumulate.\nIn parallel, work begins to construct the load test simulation that will be used to evaluate throughput metrics for the human-centric stage of the application. An HTTP simulator tool (such as JMeter, LoadRunner, or Rational Performance Tester) is used to record the browser interactions that are required to start and complete a process instance. Then, the tool can simulate many users interacting with the system in the same way. Data pools are used to allow each simulated user to log in to the IBM Business Process Manager server under distinct credentials. The HTTP simulation tool also allows retention of user tokens so that correlation of HTTP session data can be handled by the IBM Business Process Manager server, just as though the load were supplied by a collection of distinct web browsers. After the application has been certified functionally complete, and concurrent with system integration test of the application, load tests begin. The IBM Business Process Manager server is \"pre-loaded\" with a number of process instances available to work on and the database is backed up so that future measurements can begin from a controlled state. Measurements begin with a single user, ensuring that response times observed within the simulator are consistent with actual browser interactions and that resource consumption on the IBM Business Process Manager server, Database server, LDAP server and all external service provider machines appear reasonable. After this, load is gradually increased until the system successfully processes 0.15 business process instances per second, while maintaining 90th percentile response times faster than 2 seconds. Any issues observed as load increases are resolved before increasing load. In this case, the sizes of thread pools and database connection pools need to be increased from the default in order to allow the desired concurrency. Also, two new database indexes are identified based on the data access patterns of the application.\nPerformance measurement and analysis continues in this way, systematically increasing the capability of the system under test and of the applied load, until the performance architect is satisfied that the application and the infrastructure upon which it will be executed are capable of achieving the goals.\nGeneration and execution of a successful performance plan requires integration across many different types of boundaries, both physical and social. Business Process Integration itself is also a key objective for many IBM Business Process Manager solutions, automating and orchestrating activities across a wide array of software systems connected via REST, JDBC, LDAP, and web service protocols. The software solution\u2019s end-to-end performance will be limited by the slowest element within the execution chain. Similarly, effective communication across all of the teams that contribute to the application-\u2013from the business community through the application development team to the infrastructure and administration teams-\u2013can play a significant role in the success of the project.\nBlog post, \"5 Things to Know About Systematically Deploying IBM Business Process Manager\"\nOn this page, enter Business Process Manager, select the information type, and then click Search.

Specifically, I want to help writers who write fiction and self publish it.\nWhy such a specific, narrow niche?\nSpecificity means I can deep-dive into the most arcane areas of productivity, and still provide relevent information of interest to indie fiction writers.\nIt\u2019s a world I know very, very well. I\u2019m living it every day.\nI have spent years studying productivity systems in an effort to arrange my own life in a way that would maximise my writing time while I worked a day job and had a semblance of a life in between.\nAll that research and study has taught me that writers have a unique set of productivity challenges and no single \u201csystem\u201d out there addresses those challenges.\nI\u2019ve been stealing snippets from David Allen, Brian Tracy, Leo Babauta, Steve Pavlina and more for years.\nI won\u2019t say I\u2019ve studied at the feet of every single expert out there because I haven\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have that sort of time and besides, I finally came to realize that learning yet another new system was a fancy form of procrastination all on its own.\nThere is no single system out there that suits everyone.\nThere is no single system out there that will magically solve all your problems, and give you the life you want. Sorry.\nYou have to make your own system, cobbling it together a bit at a time from hundreds of sources, and tweaking and reiterating as you figure out the details.\nThen you keep doing that, over and over again.\nI can help you build your own productivity habits, because you and I have the same type of problems to deal with, that anyone who is not an indie fiction writer does not.\nIt rolls off the tongue easier than \u201cThe Productive Indie Fiction Writer\u201d.\nI tend to think of myself as an author \u2014 it\u2019s what I put on my tax returns and what I tell anyone who asks the eternal question about my occupation.\nThe domain name was available. I could have taken it.\nHowever, there far more reasons why \u201cWriter\u201d is better.\n\u201cAuthor\u201d has a specific meaning.\nShort stories, blog posts, novellas and novelettes, flash fiction, fan fiction, collaborations, series, serials\u2026 none of the myriad types of fiction a writer can produce and publish these days as a stand-alone, commercial piece of work looks like a book as we all understand books to be.\n\u201cAuthor\u201d implies a writer who produces and publishes a novel-length piece of fiction.\nGoogle search keywords show that \u201cwriter\u201d is used for searches far more than \u201cauthor\u201d.\nAs I want to help as many writers as possible, I went with the popular phrase, instead.\nBy Tracy|2018-01-04T15:42:16-06:00January 5th, 2018|Definitions|Comments Off on Why \u201cWriter\u201d?",

    "text": "It has now become quite a tradition to produce a One Hundred Pieced Piece for the London leg of the Art Car Boot Fair. A piece of work in one hundred parts, one hundred rather fast pop art flavoured paintings painted on recycled cardboard, each part of the piece for sale at just \u00a31, and that is a very important part of the piece, the notion of art for everyone, that an original piece of art can be bought by anyone at the fair (I did get haggled down to 50p last year by one young lad who claimed he only had \u00a31 left) and that material thrown away and heading for landfill should be re-used. And really if people are just going to throw things away without too much thought then leaves will grow on those thrown away things.\nThe Art Car Boot Fair happens this Sunday, this year in Vauxhall and not in Brick Lane, (don\u2019t be going to Brick Lane).\nAnd as a participating artist it is always an exciting pleasure to be invited to take part in the Art Car Boot Fair. This is the day when art lets down his or her hair (still wonder if art is a he or a she?), always one of the highlights of the London art Calendar, and this year things are to be a little bit re-booted. The theme is \u201cOriginals\u201d and there\u2019s an exciting new venue down by the Newport Street gallery in Vauxhall. This year sees a return to the event being more about the actual artists than galleries and the rule is that all the artists will be there in their car boots there to talk to and should you wish to, buy art from them, then please do\u2026.\nThe Vauxhall Art Car Boot Fair takes place on Sunday 9th July at the Workshop, by Newport Street Gallery, Whitgift Street, London SE11 between 12-6pm. Entry is priced at \u00a35.",

    "text": "1) We have been in business 28 years, have our own building, and have been recommended by USA Today and as one of the top seven companies in country. We have been recommended by other industry leaders such as TUG and Timesharing Today magazine as one of the top ten companies to do business with - you need a company like ours to help you.\n2) We have our own building on the biggest street in Salt Lake City Utah, State Street. Many of your internet timeshare resale companies work out of their homes. We have our own building, with employees and overhead.\n3) We are a member of the BBB in good standing. You're welcome to call them about us. Just click on the logo on the front page of our website. We have an A grade with the BBB and we have had very few complaints with them in 28 years. Other resale companies continually change their names and start over to \"clean their slate\" so to speak with the BBB. If you check with the BBB of these other companies, many of them will have a list of 50 to 100 complaints already.\n4) Our company name has not changed in 28 years. Most companies have changed their name several times to adjust to the complaints.\n5) We have been warned to tell all our callers or internet clients to not do business with any company that does not have the BBB online credibility logo on the front page of their website. We have that logo.\n7) We have a credible website with up to 500,000 hits per month. Our search engine positioning is very high with Google, MSN, AOL and the big search engines.\n8) We offer a sincere, honest approach to this controversial industry. We won't hype up the value of your property only to get a bigger upfront fee. We won't make any guarantees that we can sell your timeshare quickly or at all - but we do promise to do our very best to help you sell your timeshare week.\n9) That's the way the industry is, you must pay some money upfront. If you go to the LA Times, you will pay upfront; if you go to any of the big resale companies, you will pay upfront. The only resale companies that do not charge money are the small companies working out of their homes and who do not offer world wide exposure. You can try these other companies, but most likely, you will try us someday - so why not now. You might as well go with a company rated by USA Today and Timesharing Today magazine as one of the top 7 companies, and a company with a good solid reputation, and with a company that's been around for 28 years. You might as well try us.\n10) We sell 300 to 400 timeshares per year and have sold or helped to sell about 10,000 timeshare weeks since our inception 28 years ago.",

    "text": "For those who just can\u2019t get enough power from other luxury supercars on the market, consider the Zenvo ST-1 from Denmark. This luxury supercar has everything the enthusiast wants. Everything on the car is chosen by the customer.\nThis vehicle is a 100 percent, pure Danish vehicle. Everything from design to manufacture is done in Denmark. Customers can go through only one dealer in the United States to get this car, which has a price tag of $1.8 million. Empirio Motor Group of New York City will fly buyers to the Zenvo factory in Denmark. Here, customers will choose every option from interior styling to color and wheels. The vehicle is then constructed to the exact specifications of the customer and then brought back to the US via plane. To date, there are only three of these vehicles in the country, and only 15 of these models is expected to be manufactured.\nThe ST-1 has a 16-valve, 8 cylinder engine coupled with a six-speed manual transmission powered to the rear wheels. This sleek vehicle will get you from 0 to 60mph in only 2.9 seconds. That\u2019s roughly 1,100 horses galloping through your veins!\nIn keeping with the racing appearance of the vehicle, the tires are 19 inches in the front and 20 inches in the rear. This vehicle weighs 1376kg, or just over 3033 pounds. You only get 105mm of ground clearance with the Zenvo ST-1, so it\u2019s best not to take out on bumpy roads. Of course, the double wishbone suspension will help absorb and variations in the road.\nInside the vehicle you will find nothing short of what you would expect for almost 2 million dollars. Airbags, check. Cruise control, check. Electronic analog instrument panel, check. Leather everything, check. G-force meter, check. What more could you possibly want? A theft system? That\u2019s included as well.\nNothing is forgotten on this super vehicle. With only three in the US currently and only 15 to be made, maybe you will be lucky enough to see one someday.",

Choux pastry is finicky, the smallest details can affect the shape and how it rises. Check out this recipe from the Tummy Train here!\nFeel free to double this recipe if you want two trays but for me, it made around 16 decent size choux shells.\n1) Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a bowl. Preheat your oven to 400F.\n2) Heat your butter and water until it boils. Add the flour mixture.\n3) Stir in your pan until the mix comes together into a homogenous mixture.\n4) Transfer into a bowl and press the dough against the sides of the bowl to release the steam. Let sit for 5 minutes.\n5) Grate some lemon zest into your dough to help make it taste less eggy. With an electric mixer, slowly add the beaten eggs gradually. Stir at medium-high speed until the dough because smooth and glue-like. Take a bit with your spatula and if the dough drops from your spatula, it\u2019s ready.\n6) Put your choux paste into a piping bag.\n7) Pipe little domes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Dip your finger in water to smooth the peaks over.\n*optional*If you are adding your craquelin cookie tops, you can cut circles and put them on at this point, here\u2019s a recipe I have used from I am a Food Blog\u2019s site.\n8) Bake for 15 minutes at 400F.\n9) Without opening the oven, reduce the heat to 350F and bake for another 35 minutes.\n10) Poke a small vent into the side of the puffs and continue drying in the oven door ajar for another five minutes with the heat off.\n11) Cool on a drying rack.\n12) Drill holes into the bottom of your choux shells and fill with pastry cream, see my recipe for that here.\n13) Dust with powdered sugar or dip in caramel or chocolate.\nNext Gluten-Free Orange and Almond Cake with Peaches and Pistachios!",

There is also a sleeper sofa in the living room.\nThis cabin offers privacy while still having a wonderful view of the lake. This cabin sits just behind cabins #2 and #3 and thus no other cabins are on either side of it. There is great parking alongside the main driveway which makes for easy access for our guests who wish to take their boat on and off the property to fish surrounding lakes.\nFor the 2016 season, this cabin underwent major renovations in the kitchen, dining room, living room, and bathroom areas. This cabin has an open-concept design in the kitchen, dining, and living room areas with all new flooring installed in these areas. A beautiful rough-sawn basswood vaulted ceiling is now over the kitchen and dining room areas. A new window installed over the kitchen sink provides for lots of additional light coming in as well as another beautiful view of Jessie Lake. The bathroom was also completely remodeled and equipped with a brand new vanity, 36-inch shower, and new flooring.",

    "text": "Elliptics is a fault-tolerant distributed key/value (no-relational) database system. The core storage engine is a hash table. All keys are hashed into 512-bit ids via sha512 algorithm by default.\nElliptics was initially created in 2007 as part of POHMELFS v1. POHMELFS is the abbreviation of the Parallel Optimized Host Message Exchange Layered File System, which is a cache-compatible distributed file system developed by Russian Linux-developer Evgeny Polyakov. It could be viewed as a protocol to share files between file systems on computers via LAN. In 2009 Elliptics seperated from POHMELFS and became a consistent distributed storage system later.\nElliptics supports basic lock operation on the key-value pair. It uses such key ID to grant the lock, which makes the operation in Elliptics is atomic in the single group. However, there are no locks between the groups for synchronous. There is no deadlock detection in system level. It is the user's responsibility to prevent deadlock when developing client program. And Elliptics uses eventual consistency model to maintain data replicas, which means the data in a group may not maintain the same at any time, but they will eventually be synced with others sometimes in the future.\nElliptics own storage supports key-value data model, but it can support SQL database for example by writing an own backend, so that supports relational data storage.\nThe index structure that exposed to the client is named secondary indexes. Its implementation using STL `std::map<T>` template in C++.\nIsolations are used in the Elliptics core and used to spawn slaves/workers in a controlled environment. Each worker is a separate process, which can be interpreted as a transaction. Resources accessed by workers can be limited to process level or Group level, which leads to two types of isolation in Elliptics: Process and CGroup. Process isolation cannot be configured while CGroup level isolation can take system configuration as the argument. For the details of isolation, readers and writers perform differently. Due to the locking mechanism is controlled manually by the clients, if no lock is got during reads, writers can sneak in and readers will return old and new contents accordingly. Because of the design that Elliptics updates replicas in parallel without holding the single 'replica' log, when reading from multiple replicas, it is possible that one reader will receive old content while another one will see the new one already. When it comes to writers, the writers will receive the completion status for every replica in any cases. If the transactions are atomic among the physically distributed replicas, the clients can implement a central entry point which will hold the lock and updated it only after all completion statuses have been received. By this way, transaction rollback can be implemented.\nActually, from the API documents, we can find Elliptics doesn't provide join methods to be called from the client. Due to it is not table-oriented and only guaranteed atomicity level is per object in a single replica. This decision was made for performance and scalability reasons. However, in the backends internal, merging and joins is available and will vary from backend to backend, which is controlled by Query Execution core. For example, when using a relational database as the backend, Join will be supported, while when using levelDB as the backend, Join will not be supported.\nElliptics uses replication to ensure data availability form the beginning of its design. To use replication features, a group of servers are logically bound together and the servers within the same group all contain the same data. For recovery logging, Elliptics uses route table to record the set of nodes and the key(ID)-value pairs' ID ranges of each node. A route table at least contains the following fields: timestamp, group id, hex strings to the group number, and address. Elliptics supports three types of recovery: hash ring recovery (`merge`), deep hash ring recovery (`deep_merge`), replica recovery (`dc`). The merge approach mainly supports data recovery in the same group by moving from one node to another by route tables. Replica recovery is designed to ensure the durability between groups. Elliptics also supports manual recovery operations.\nThe API is designed to support [C](https://web.archive.org/web/20160511155843/http://doc.reverbrain.com:80/elliptics:api-c), [C++](https://web.archive.org/web/20160511155848/http://doc.reverbrain.com:80/elliptics:api-cc), and [Python](http://doc.reverbrain.com/elliptics:api-python). Python APIs are designed to config Elliptics client, including Logger, Config, Node, Session, etc. C++ APIs are designed to configure the client side Elliptics as well, but with less APIs than Python API library. Node is the main controlling structure of Elliptics. C APIs could be used to config both Client and Server, with the functionalities of creation, configuration, server-side processing, cache and backend. For the client side, everything is built on the asynchronous API model, while we can do both synchronous and asynchronous calls in server side.\nStorage architecture is named as Backends in Elliptics. Elliptics has three low-level backends: filesystem (where written objects are stored as files), Eblob (fast append-only storage) and Smack (small compressible objects stored in sorted tables). Moreover, Elliptics implemented both the generic storage protocol and its own specific protocol. Therefore, data stored in other services can be routed to Elliptics. For example, Elliptics can connect to MySQL servers and trigger some special commands to read/write data into Elliptics.\nElliptics contains three layers: Frontends layers, Elliptics core, and Backends. The role of frontend is to connect with multiple clients to the core to perform the query execution. The Backends are the data storage layers which provide different storage systems.\nRevision #27 | Updated 12/31/2018 3:39 p.m.",

    "text": "Its always important to have evidence of all our experiences!!\nI highly suspect that is me snoring.... I seem to record that a lot when I'm at camp close to the recorder!\nLaughter... thanks for the good laugh!\nI'm not saying that what you say isn't possible, I just keep it simple. Primates slap the ground for various reasons like getting attention, frustration, and even as a warning when highly agitated so for me it is just typical primate behavior.\nLast week when exploring site 2 with a friend we heard a whoop up the ridge from where we were at. He has no interest in what it may have been but did say it sure sounds like a person. Definately not an animal in his words.\nYesterday I went up and wandered around that ridge. I found numerous game trails. The things that caught my eyes the most were in that area of the ridge where we were whooped at I found 2 stick manipulations.\nThis is the first one that I have found where branches and sticks were weaved together. I was amazed at how it was \"put\" together. You can see that there is at least 3 different types of branches used. I bet I spent a good 20 minutes just looking at it. Everything natural, but no way I could phathom nature made.\nThe second was about 200 feet away. This one is about 6 1/2 feet off the ground.\nThis one kinda spooked me. It was broke off one direction and twisted to about a 45 degree angled from the direction of the break and jammed between two trees. After talking to MOMO64 I know I am gonna go looking for more! Shortly after finding this one I sat down on a log to rest. Just at the limits of my hearing, I could swear I heard an owl. When I got home it hit me that I should not be hearing owls that time of the day. If I am wrong about that someone let me know.\nI will be returning to the area in the near future to do some more looking. Any ideas or input is greatly welcome.\nThe break isn't alarming at all to me...it can happen in nature. BUT what does set off red flags in the lower-second photo, is all the bent over arched trees....don't get me wrong, that can easily be faked /hoaxed/ done intentionally.....and THEN a photo taken. yet I cannot prove that is the case not anymore than a Bigfoot did it.\nI do find it highly unusual, more so than the tree break.\neven trees that have been uprooted and shoved into the ground TOP-first is supposed to warn you , THIS is their land , this is my power--stay away.\nall those bent over trees in your photo -for instance, is a show of strength, and sort of a sign to stay out.....a warning of sorts.\nand I don't mean to sound accousary about YOU or your friends faking this......only that it can be done rather easily----the bending over of all the trees.\nagain I am not saying that is what you did. people see incredible things all the time but it's the case of \"I Had to be there to see it---to believe it.\"\nsee the site and environment for myself kind of thing. and no I was not there -being honest.\nThose up-rooted trees in areas of clear cuts have shown up all over the country and has been debunked as the logging crews doing a victory stand after logging a challenging site. And yes you are correct nature does a lot of things out there that folks want to call bigfoot stuff. This post was from real early in my time here in the group when I was real green. I can't say for sure they were bigfoot related but it gave me a starting point for continued investigation into the area. When it gets fun is when you put a recorder close to a possible manipulation/structure and you get audio on a consistent bases. The it does put a bit more weight into it being legit.\nJanuary 8-9th, I put a drop box in the area where I first had what I think was bigfoot activity. I don't do a lot in that area because of accessibility. It does have a pretty large spring on it that has numerous game trails leading into the area. I figured if the game critters use the spring regularly I suspect that Bigfoot would also. It is a deep rugged holler with flat self limestone, with pools for the water to collect in.\nIt was an interesting review of the audio. The last have of the video I found to be interesting. The subtle and cautious way that was recorded there so much reminds me of the recording I've gotten around camp when we have seen eyes shine, had rocks thrown into camp, or saw silhouettes in the wood line. This is the first time I have recorded it with a drop box set up. Leads to the question: Did they smell my scent on the drop box? For that to happen, I suspect they have a much keener sense of smell than I thought. One thing about research, you always seem to get more questions than answers!\nIs there a reason you use the color scheme you do for your sound system Audacity?\nSounds good... meaning you get some good sounds.\nIt is what audacity uses with their spectrogram settings. The colors can be turned to grey scale but once you get used to using it, it can really help in identifying sounds buy the signatures they leave behind. By the thickness of the signatures can show how close they are etc. Using it as a tool to help see what you are hearing works good for me and gives be a little heads up before I hear a vocal. I review all my audio using audacity.",

Their Hosting is the cheapest hosting on internet; this was done deliberately so as to maintain a viable business over long term. In fact, everything they do at Dollar2Host.Com has a long-term view in mind, from the selection of hardware to software, and, especially, their staffs! They believe that they must make the best investment on our human resources so that they could provide the best support to their customers.\nCurrently, they are using one of the most versatile and feature-rich web hosting software in this business. You could try out their hosting software with a demo account and see it for yourself. They are also constantly upgrading their software to provide a wider range of features at, again, affordable price.\n1) Unlimited disk space and Bandwidth.\n3) Can take them for a test drive.\n6) They provide best hardware.\n7) Superior uptime and page load speed.\nThey own and maintain all of their servers, which are custom-built with high quality components. By providing their customers with their own servers and not going through a third-party, they can provide high speed efficiency and security as well as quick response to support issues.\nDollar2Host services are good and value for money. Great to use Dollar2Host services and hosting packages. I never felt difficulty with their services. They update new features and services in hosting services. Dollar2Host is good for hosting services and recommended.\nMy friend was using Dollar2Host for his business, and I heard he was complaining about their pathetic service and worst customer support. Because for my company hosting thought of going to this provider. But thanks for the info by my friend.\nIn Dollar2Host they provide cloud at a very cheap price but the main drawback is of their services, they provide pathetic service, with no proper customer service. This is one of the worst cloud providers.\nIn Dollar2Host they give good services but they only issue is with the price and features. When compared to other best web hosting providers this has very fewer features. Even they have very poor and dissatisfying security system.\nA very bad experience with Dollar2Host. They are not supportive with customers and their hosting packages are bad and not suitable for business.",

Just a short 10 minute scenic drive along Horn Lake and you will find the driveway to this quaint home on your left.\nRecreation : Tatla Lake is the hub for the huge surrounding area that includes Westbranch and the Tatlayoko Valley. Tatla and area began with ranching which is very evident as you travel through lush fields and pastures and past the Chilcotin fences. The community members of Tatla Lake are very proactive and participate in many activities year-round including cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, fishing, hunting and other local sponsored events. The area is also known for its many tour operators that offer anything from ranch vacations, trail rides, fishing trips, hiking, wildlife viewing or hunting.

This bluff offers hiking trails with stunning views as well as Rainbow Trout up to 3 pounds and Bull Trout up to 10 pounds.\nThe jagged mountain peaks of the Chilcotin are covered in vast ice fields and wide alpine meadows, gradually softening into large valleys, gently rolling foothills, pine covered forests, lakes and rivers and the grasslands of the Chilcotin Plateau.\nThis is essentially backcountry at its best complete with some of the best fishing lakes and rivers to be found in North America. The expansive Chilcotin lies between the Fraser River and Coast Mountains, a 5,000 square kilometre plateau of rangeland, where thousands of cattle roam unfenced land.\nHistory : History on the Chilcotin area can be found on the Visit the West Chilcotin website.",

Both top guys, their knowledge and insight, enthusiasm and empathy for our business and work was second to none.\nA little background, Liberation secured funding to produce a film which will premier on National Nut Day on 22nd October. The purpose of the film is simple, Liberation Foods is the UK\u2019s only Fairtrade, farmer-owned nut company and we want to tell everyone about it. The film will be used to tell the story of our partners in Bolivia, their livelihood and the journey of Brazil nuts.\nLiberation works with and buys nuts from co-operatives whose small-scale growers and farmers own 44 percent of their company; our aim is to secure decent incomes for smallholder nut producers around the world.\nLiberation\u2019s products make sure producers are paid at least the Fairtrade minimum price for their nuts and receive a Fairtrade premium for every kilogram they sell; ensuring farmers can earn a decent living from their labor. These premiums are then invested in the community for future projects, such as solar-powered fences, health care and education facilities.\nThe experience of being behind the scenes observing how these guys work was exciting, moments that come once in a life time. I think a total of 24 hours of film are \u2018in the can\u2019. One of the most magical moments for me was the sight of groups of local children excited by the camera drone \u2018which they fondly referred to as a helicopter\u2019 \u2013 the footage from this alone will inspire you, when you watch the film you will see the majesty of the Brazil trees from the skies.\nIf there was a series \u2018Post Cards from Bolivia\u2019 then I could bore you with chapter on filming alone!\nNext time I will tell you more about the workshops and Coinacapa, one of the cooperative who we travelled with..",

    "text": "Most of us are familiar with the \u201cbreathing tests\u201d that asthmatics and emphysema patients take to see how their disease is fairing either during a flare up or routine monitoring of the their medications\u2014inhalers and such. Yet if you don\u2019t have any lung disease, you are unlikely ever to have taken such a test. We, and many prominent pulmonary specialists, think that is unfortunate.\nWhy test my lungs if I have no lung disease and don\u2019t smoke?\nSpirometry, as the breathing test is called, turns out to be a interesting biomarker of aging hiding in the clothing of pulmonary specialist\u2019s test. While it certainly functions as a screen for early lung disease in undiagnosed asthmatics and smokers, it also measures the lung age of healthy individuals. In fact, in order to determine if the result of a spirometry test is abnormal, it must be compared to a large database of normal results adjusted for height, gender, ethnicity, and age. Spirometry performed by tens of thousands of individuals has resulted in large databases which can be used to determine lung age.\nThe complete testing session takes about 10 minutes. The patient takes as deep a breath as possible, places the airflow meter (pneumotach) in his mouth, then blows out the air as fast as possible in the first second. He then continues to blow for at least 5 seconds longer in an effort to completely empty his lungs. The computer attached to the pneumotach calculates the total amount of air expelled during the full exhalation, and the amount expelled in the first second. These measures are called the forced vital capacity (FVC), and the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), respectively. The procedure is repeated until 3 consistent measures are recorded.\nBoth the FVC and FEV1 decline after about age 25, but the FEV1 is the best marker. It declines about 1 to 2 percent per year as the graphs below depict.",

    "text": "As a Cardinals rookie in 1962, first baseman Fred Whitfield was one of the best power-hitting prospects the franchise had produced in years.\n\u201cHe has a quicker bat than anyone on the Cardinals and he can reach the roof at Busch Stadium,\u201d coach Vern Benson told The Sporting News.\nThe Sporting News hailed Whitfield as the Cardinals\u2019 \u201cbiggest surprise of 1962\u201d and Whitfield was selected by big-league managers, coaches and players as the first baseman on the 1962 Topps all-star rookie team.\nSigned by Cardinals scout Mercer Harris, Whitfield was a standout in the minor leagues. He hit .309 with 23 home runs for Keokuk in 1958; .285 with 28 homers for Winston-Salem and Tulsa in 1959; .310 with 22 homers for Tulsa in 1960; and .301 with 18 homers for Charleston in 1961.\nHe was batting .323 and leading the International League in home runs (eight) and RBI (28) when he was promoted to the Cardinals on May 26, 1962.\nThe Cardinals were seeking a right-handed batter to replace injured outfielder Minnie Minoso. Because of a weak throwing arm after he hurt his shoulder as an American Legion pitcher, Whitfield only could play first base. Unlike Minoso, he batted left-handed.\nAccording to The Sporting News, it was Cardinals business manager Art Routzong who convinced general manager Bing Devine and manager Johnny Keane to promote Whitfield.\nIn his first five pinch-hit appearances for the Cardinals, Whitfield produced three hits and a walk.\nWhitfield finished the 1962 season with a .266 batting average, eight home runs and 34 RBI in 158 at-bats for the Cardinals. He hit .333 as a pinch-hitter and .412 with two outs and runners in scoring position. He was especially effective versus the Phillies, batting .313 with 13 RBI in 12 games.\n\u201cFred did an exceptionally good job, especially as a pinch-hitter and part-time player, jobs usually handled by older, experienced men,\u201d Devine said.\nHowever, Whitfield became expendable because White, who batted left-handed, was entrenched at first base, and the Cardinals needed pitching.\nOn Dec. 15, 1962, the Cardinals dealt Whitfield to the Indians for pitcher Ron Taylor and infielder Jack Kubiszyn.\nWhitfield hit 20 or more home runs three times for the Indians (21 in 1963, 26 in 1965 and 27 in 1966). In a nine-year major-league career (1962-70), he played for the Cardinals, Indians, Reds and Expos, batting .253 with 108 home runs.",

    "text": "Where do i start with staircases? Help for you on your new Staircase.\nStaircases.org - Where do I Start ?\nStairplan manufacture purpose made timber staircases, We use the latest software and cnc technology to produce the stairs offering excellent quality on a affordable budget, We offer a wide range of stairparts ie:- handrails, spindles, ballusters, newels ect from a wide range of suppliers ie:- Richard Burbidge, Clive Durose, Traditional Products, Heritage wood turners all at trade prices.\nSo you want a new staircase but you don't know where to start ?\nAre you going to design the stair layout yourself ?\nOnce I have established the rise the next step is to establish the number of risers required for this particular staircase, for a domestic staircase you need a rise between 190 and 220mm to stay within building regulations. (Eg :- 2600mm Rise (floor to floor) divided by 13 would equal 200mm, equaling 13N\u00ba risers.)Or just let Stairplan know the floor to floor measurement on your enquiry.\nThe next thing you have to do is work out the tread size other wise known as the going, the going is the face of one riser to the face of the next riser. The minimum going for a staircase to comply with building regulations is 220mm and the pitch of a domestic staircase must not exceed 42\u00ba. Use the Rise and Go page to help you with this.\nWidth - there is no restriction with how narrow you can go with a staircase but the width of a standard flight of stairs is 860mm and I would not recommend a width of less than 600mm even for access to a single room.\nHeadroom - You need a minimum of 2000mm of clear headroom above the pitch line of the stairs, so take care when your planning on where to put your staircase especially when your going into your loft and make sure you stair well opening is big enough. Dont always rely on your architects drawings sort your stairs out while it is still possible to alter your stair well as it could get expensive to alter it later.\nCorners - When it comes to corners you have a number of options the simplest option is a 90\u00ba quarter turn landing for this you only need to allow the width of the staircase, the next option is a 3N\u00ba tread winder for this you need to allow approximately 900 x 900mm in the corner depending on your going and the width of your staircase, the next option is a 4\u00ba tread winder for this you need to allow approximately 1000 x 1000mm again depending on your going and the width.\nNow you have got a rough idea of the design of your staircase draw it using our Stair planner and send it to us for a quotation.\nOpen Plan ( no risers, good for letting light through, more expensive than standard closed staircases) Open Plan staircases have a restriction on the space you can have open (max 100mm) you can get over this in a number of ways the most common way is to have a riser down stand this can be straight or curved ect, the next option would be to have an upstand on the back of the tread this would provide the same effect, then you have the option of somthing like the Stainless steel bar inserts.\nChoose your opening step detail maybe a simple bullnose step or a Curtail or a double curtail.\nChoose a handrail system post to post or continuous, maybe Stainless steel with glass infills You choose.\nWell as a rough guide if you had a Pine staircase costing \u00a3700.00 you would be looking at around \u00a3900.00 in Parana pine with Hemlock stairparts , \u00a31400.00 in Dark Hardwood, \u00a31900.00 in Beech and \u00a32800.00 in Oak this would vary down to the individual staircase and the amount of landing handrails required.\nDo you need Stairplan to design your staircase layout ?\nDo you need detailed drawings for your preferred staircase for approval from Building Control ?\nPhone Stairplan on 01952 216000 for further details.",

    "text": "Hometown Humanities brings a year\u2019s worth of humanities-based programming to a single community\u201415 to 40 events, all FREE OF CHARGE and open to the public, selected from Humanities Montana\u2019s extensive program catalog. Humanities Montana staff works with the selected community to design a schedule that includes public speakers from our Montana Conversations and Speakers-in-the-Schools programs, community conversations on local issues, reading discussion groups, and an array of other possibilities.\nThe aim of Hometown Humanities is to support the particular cultural interests of a Montana community, and to explore the capacity of the humanities to enrich lives, foster inquiry, and stimulate civil and informed conversations about the human experience. We like to get people talking\u2014sometimes about challenging and sensitive subjects\u2014in ways that broaden perspectives and bring people together.\nHometown Humanities is a group effort. It requires a leadership team of 8-12 local people from libraries, schools, museums, businesses, government, media, etc. Together, these leaders work with Humanities Montana staff to select the year\u2019s slate of events, decide how Hometown Humanities can enhance existing or upcoming cultural programs, provide logistical support, promote upcoming events, and assess what works and what doesn\u2019t along the way.\nWho is eligible to apply: Representatives from any community with a population under 20,000. We define community as a town or group of small towns in close proximity, reservation, or colony and are open to other possibilities. Whatever it\u2019s make-up, the community must be willing to make Hometown Humanities programs available to the general public. Collaboration is so essential that we require co-applicants from two equally invested local organizations (e.g. a librarian and a school teacher, a local business owner and a museum employee, a health & human services worker and a member of the chamber of commerce, etc.). In section 3 of the application you\u2019ll identify more individuals and organizations who might lend their support.\nPlease respond to the following questions fully but succinctly. Your application will be evaluated based on your community\u2019s stated need for humanities-based programming, its capacity to host and promote events, the range and commitment of local supporters, and your town\u2019s geographic location relative to previous Hometown Humanities sites.\nContact Program Director Kim Anderson via email or at 406-243-6022 if you have any questions about the application process.\nThe aim of Hometown Humanities is to support deeply the particular cultural interests of a Montana community, and by doing so explore the capacity of the humanities to enrich lives, foster inquiry, and stimulate civil and informed conversations about the human experience.",

    "text": "Investing money has been a source of debate among Christians for centuries. Some say that investing is unbiblical and any extra surplus should be given to the needy, while others argue that investing must be a part of every Christian's financial plan. In this post, we will address these and other issues concerning Christian investing.\nThe first topic that needs to be considered is whether investing is or is not scriptural. As in many cases, the answer depends on the situation. Anyone investing because of greed (Luke 12:15), to get rich quick (Proverbs 23:4-5), or to massage his ego (Proverbs 29:23) is not participating in biblically-based investing. On the other hand, those who are acting as good stewards as in Luke 19:12-27 or those who are saving for future needs such as college or retirement (Proverbs 6:6-8) are participating in biblical investing. In the end, it all depends on the attitude, which is ultimately determined by God. Remember, \"All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord.\" (Proverbs 16:2).\nThe greater the potential return, the greater the risk. (Proverbs 27:12) This is a fact of economic life. If someone has a \"no risk\" investment that generates 25% each year, stay away from him. Either he's deranged or lying.\nDiversify your investments. (Ecclesiastes 11:2) Diversification is essential to long-term stability. If one investment goes down, another you have can offset it by going up. In short, this is just another way of saying \"don't put all of your eggs in one basket\".\nBe sure you understand the investment you are considering. (Proverbs 24:3-4) You are God's steward, and you need to understand how it will be used. If you don't understand, then don't invest.\nDon't risk money you can't afford to lose. (Ecclesiastes 5:13-14) If losing the money your are investing would cause financial ruin, family stress, or any other major problem, then do not invest it in a risky place. A safe investment such as federal government bonds would be more appropriate in this case.\nDon't make a quick decision -- take time to think and pray. (Psalm 37:7) Stop and consider what you are doing. Once again, you are God's steward, and you need to handle His money appropriately.\nIn addition, you'll need to determine your goals -- what you want to accomplish -- before you invest. Since this is different for every person, it is impossible to provide specific direction that will apply to everyone. However, there are some general topics that you will want to consider. These include your age, income, and temperament. See the investment section of this blog for articles that may help you in this area.\nMy advice is to find a successful, Christian advisor who can not only recommend good investments but add biblically-based advice. If you can't find a good Christian advisor, go to a good non-Christian advisor (of course, you'll have to weigh his advice in accordance with biblical principles). While some may scoff at this suggestion, think if it was a brain surgeon instead. Would you rather have a top-notch non-Christian or an average Christian operate on you? I think you get the point.\nEither way, you need to get good counsel from a variety of sources as \"plans fail for a lack of counsel, but with many advisors they succeed.\" (Proverbs 15:22). Rest assured that if you need wisdom in this area, you can ask God, and He will provide it. (James 1:5).\nI find it odd that none of your mentions of Christian investing discusses the morality of the investments you make. I don't think that it is important to use the bible to decide investing strategies. However, I think that the bible has much to say about supporting immoral companies. Investing in Altria may be a good dividend play, but I can't make money from something that causes death. Other companies, such as Caterpillar or pay-day loan companies, may operate in gray areas. With these companies, it is up to you, during your stock research to decide if the moral line has been crossed. In the end, Christian investing is about finding companies and ventures that don't violate your values, not investing strategies.\nGood to find this site. There isnt all that much on out there on the relationship of our faith to business.\nDo you mean how do you subscribe to this blog?\nThis just goes to Prove the saying \"...you can Prove Anything with a misquote/misuse of the Bible\". If YOU want to know how to survive without cash, day-to-day, you Have to be Realistic...Not as the World Sees it; but, as Christ said it. The Short-cut Is: 1.Give it all away; and then 2.Ask the Father to show you/support your needs; and then 3.Wait for His directions to you. It is easier if you First learn as a child, how to wait on Him; and, how to take orders (obey) from Him. This Proceedure has Nothing to do with Religion and nothing to do with Any Preacher. It is Christian. But, prior to being Christian, this is how the Ancients' survived...by obediance to the Almighty Creator of the Universe. By the way, since He knows your needs Better than you do, you will be very surprised. Others, who don't know your 'secret' won't believe you either. AND, the less you 'fret' about your situation, the richer you get and richer you appear to be. You do pay Income taxes on any income....such as a job, or inheritance.\nThank you so very much for this article and for your blog. I need a lot of help with financial things and being a Christian, I would like to ensure I am handling my finances, etc. biblically! This is wonderful! May God continue to bless you!\nvery sound biblical info! It's good to know that individuals still use the scriptures to please God in all they do when it comes to non-moral issues such as investing. I want to start investing in some mutual-funds and any wisdom I can get will be beneficial in this process as I seek to leave an inheritance for my children. Thank you!\nHi, I own a mortgage cmpany and I'm haveing a diffcult time getting people to embrace doing there job in more of a servant attitude than a profit attitude. Do anyone have any pointers on how to refocus the mindset of my office.\nPeople make choices every day - where they work, where they spend and donate money...yet many do not consider the moral implications of invetsing. Do your investments match your values? If you are a Christian, do your investments oppose your Faith? Through your investments, you may be supporting the adult entertainment industry, abortion industry, or supporting the homosexual agenda. Take the time to find out where you are invetsing and make changes.\nhi. well lets see, profiting from mortgages is sin. Let me explain...the Bible says that the borrower is the slave to the lender. when you issue mortgages, you are affectively enslaving people til death...and you want God to bless that?",

    "text": "Discussion in 'CNC Mills/Routers' started by getoffmyland, Jun 3, 2015.\nA modified OX based on Aluminum plates cut on a waterjet. Some new ideas and additions from other builds are included.\nI am now having a look at cutting and squaring the v-slot.\nAny suggestions on the best way?\nMy preferred choice at the moment is to make a jig for the router that allows a square vertical cut across the end of the v-slot that I can \"feed\" the v-slot into. once one end is square on all pieces I can setup a stop at the far end, set the v-slot in and nibble away to make square and to length.\nI set up a simple V-slot jig to trim ends with. Worked fairly well.\nThe plate you see at the far end was used to gang multiple similar pieces together so all would be trimmed to the same length. I'd trim one end and then rotate the whole piece and do the other.\nMark Carew, GrayUK and getoffmyland like this.\n@getoffmyland looks great what kind of aluminum? How thick is the aluminum? And final question are you happy with it?\nI think its 3150... thats what I was told but could be anything, feels strong enough.\nAt the moment I am really happy with it, I guess I wont really be sure until it is fully built and tested. I am still waiting for some screws and bits so I will not know if I have everything in the right spot but I figured it would be a learning process and once I have a machine up and running then version 2 can be started.\nYesterday I tapped some v-slot (broke the tap on the last hole) so need to either try and remove or go with plan b which is leave that bolt out or use an extra angle bracket there.\nFor the work involved and with the equipment I have its just not worth it. So I tried a scotch brite pad and got a decent brushed finish that looks a lot better. so I am going to remove the major scratches and have a brushed look.\nI am surprised that would be strong enough. I guess the plates are not that big. Good to know Thanks for the info.\nTry using a DA sander with like about 80 grit. Leaves a matte finish that hides scratches really giod!!!\nI finally got some time to work on the CNC again.... well, I sorted out a \"workshop\" with some cheap ikea tables and shelves so I am not working on the floor.\nI also started to look at the electronics side of things..... got a parallel post card so I had to do a quick test.\nAnyhow, I hooked up 1 stepper and got it moving...... great!!!!\nso now I am trying to work out the setting and setup..... I have read loads and I think I have a good idea where to start.\n3. Mach 3 - I have not even begun to look at settings and tuning... any tips?\nI read a load of things(mostly bad/do do it) about the stepper drivers... I will eventually upgrade to Gecko when I have the cash.... but one question..... I noticed the stepper and driver getting warm... almost hot to the touch..... what is normal for these?\nmach3 videos on yt. Paul Campbell is the. channel name....I think.\nThe motors and drivers do get warm sometimes hot. They heat up the most when they're powered but not moving. some drivers will cut some of the motor current when they aren't being commanded. This reduces heat. If they're too hot to touch then you probably should dial down on the current. getting some airflow to them is a plus. If possible, heatsinking the drivers also helps.\nI have watched a few videos but good to know the \"guy\" to watch.\nI read a load of things(montly bad/do do it) about the stepper drivers... I will eventually upgrade to Gecko when I have the cash.... but one question..... I noticed the stepper and driver getting warm... almost hot to the touch..... what is normal for these?\nSo, those \"drivers\" are already heatsinked. One problem I've read on them is that there isn't thermal paste between the driver and heatsink. Some users have found that the dip switch settings dont match up with what is printed and others have found that it does! There also seems to be idle current issues where the driver is either stuck in 30% current or never goes into current reduction.\nAt this point I think you should figure out what kinda of personality your drives have then work on the relationship from there or reconsider it entirely.\nIt's not unusual for motors and drives to be hot. No offense to getoffmyland, but the package he is using is the greatest or most efficient. Its probably why they're sinked to begin with. There are a lot of variables. Enclosure size, machine environment, power supply, load vs. motor characteristics, driver capabilities, etc. Depending on the scenario, adding a heatsink or fan may be necessary and isn't uncommon.\nQ.) How should I heatsink my drive?\nA.) There is not drive-specific heatsink for any Geckodrive, and there are a variety of ways to heatsink your drive. What you should do is ensure that your heatsink has fins to increase surface area, and have air flowing over it. A good heatsink to use is a standard CPU heatsink with some heatsink compound in between the drive\u2019s plate and the finned aluminum heatsink. The method to determining if it is being cooled adequately is to feel the drive while it is running. If it is uncomfortable to the touch, then the electronics are uncomfortable as well.\nEven though they do not heatsink their drivers, they do realize that it may be necessary under certain circumstances.\nIn the end, it's not unusual for a correctly sized stepper motor and drive to produce a bit of heat around room temp. There are a number of variables to consider when determining why things are heating up and if action should be taken. The tb6600 package might need to be revaluated by getoffmyland. There is certainly some inspection and additional reading to be done. They aren't the best drivers as they seem riddled with problems overall, but if you're on a budget and theyre working for ya, then hey! Adding a fan and/or heatsinking may just be key.\nI measured the temps on drivers and motors during intensive cutting at ambient temperature of 42 degrees Celsius (!!); the motors didn't go over 50 Celsius and the driver boards were around 48 Celsius (in closed box with two fans, one extracting the other blowing air in). Drivers TB6600 http://www.hotmcu.com/tb6600-1-axis...l?cPath=7_30&zenid=7h0gfih59sfgr61lvjsj9g9kn5 are doing good, but others I had before were total crap. Going for good drivers straight away (Gecko or Leadshine) looks expensive but will save you in the longer run.\nI changed a few settings and did some motor tuning and the temps have cooled down.\nI have done extensive reading on the Drives I have and know about the problems and other issues around them. It was a risk getting them but for the price I was willing to try it just to get me running. It looks like there are various versions and if you get good ones they are not that bad. I look to have good ones where the dip switches are correct and I have good heat sink contact with paste.\nI think the main issue is they are enabled all the time and when there is no movement it generates some heat... I am going to look at using the enable pins to switch to an idle mode.\nJames_Hopkins and GrayUK like this.\ni have started mine and i'm documenting with pics i will open a thread soon.i got some plates from chris on ebay.\nbut i'm interested in having more made that i will be doing some tinkering here and there.\nto bad out here where i live we don't have any water cutting places.\nand my build is not even done yet to the point where i can try to route some of then.",

    "text": "Dear Rogue Money Readers: we are posting this Open Thread to encourage Reader Comments in the spirit of \u201cif you hear something, say something\u201d as the Maelstrom of Autumn 2016 begins to unfold. The specific data points that I am watching as Q3 winds down tomorrow are listed below. But, as W. has reminded us, \u201cExpect the Unexpected,\u201d and absolutely ANYTHING can happen now between today and next Monday\u2026 and beyond as we steer through the treacherous waters of October.\n1. Posted Thursday Sept. 29th, a 3-minute update. You\u2019ll want to hit the Subscribe button at Ken\u2019s special channel page here.\nRecent ZeroHedge headlines related to our favorite German Pi\u00f1ata, Deutsche Bank, are listed below. By the time this article is posted there will likely be a dozen more. Feel free to post breaking news down in the Comments section.\nAnd then there are the two stories from Saudi Arabia: the Kingdom\u2019s continuous hemorrhaging of cash and their reaction to the JASTA Senate override of the Obama veto that now allows 9/11 victims to sue the Saudis. Will the Saudis follow through on their old threat to dump US Treasurys?\nHolding our breath to see who gets downgraded below Investment Grade first: Deutsche Bank or the Bank of Japan.\nCHINA\u2019S KABUKI TROJAN HORSE? HELLO, SDR!\nFor dessert, here comes the main event. The evening of September 30/October 01 marks the historic day when the Chinese Renminbi will be officially added to the SDR Basket of Currencies. This is an implied blessing from the High Priests at the International Monetary Fund. All Systems are now GO for the central banks of the world to load up on Chinese bonds. And if there aren\u2019t enough of those to go around, well, we\u2019ve got a special going on Market-SDRs. Hey Saudi, about those UST\u2019s that you\u2019d like to dump \u2026 hmmm?\nWe\u2019ve written often about the coming of the marriage between China and IMF, like this article New World Currency on Steroids. Jim Rickards has been one of the loudest voices on the subject and he will be chatting with Max Keiser about it yet again next week.\n.@tony_ceraulo IMF only deals with governments, but a private #SDR bond market is developing quickly. SDR bonds should be available soon!\nIn a related story, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the United Nations this week (story linked here). The IMF is just one sector of the U.N. upon which the Dragon has set her sights. We found this video statement copied below by Liu Jieyi, China\u2019s UN representative, to be thought-provoking. It has always seemed to me that a day would come when both Russia and China would realize the latent potential of this global governing body, an organization that has deliberately been kept tied to a leash of weakness by her Anglo-American masters ever since her creation. However, now with yet another escalation of the Syria tensions and China\u2019s arrival into the UN\u2019s financial framework, we wonder whether this pet beast will be allowed to play a more substantive role within the world\u2019s new management team?\nPrevious Previous post: What\u2019s that I See In Your Wallet? A True \u201cStore\u201d of Value!\nMaybe a small thing. maybe not.\nAll Australians Escorted Out of U.S. Pine Gap (Australia) Spy Base! Only Americans Permitted now . . . . ?\nAccording to Wikipedia, the Pine Gap facility at almost the geographic center of Australia, is used for controlling military satellites \"over the one third of the globe which includes China, the Asian parts of Russia and the Middle East. Central Australia was chosen because it was too remote for spy ships passing in international waters to intercept the signal.\"\nThis eviction of all Australian nationals could lead one to conclude that the U.S. is going to more of a war footing, or anticipating doing so.\nPine Gap was where Stan Deyo used to work from when he did his study of ocean temperatures and earthquakes. It was also the location of a large alien craft event.\nThere\u2019s a one week holiday in China starting Saturday. Odd time for the RMB SDR to come online.\nOne has to wonder that if the Chinese are involved, wouldn\u2019t a one-week break in trading be a good time to watch other markets around the world collapsing? Hmmm.\nShould mention also, that tomorrow is considered to be a \u2018black moon\u2019. I\u2019m sure the elites are aware of it, supposedly I\u2019ve read \u2018spells are more potent\u2019. With so much mischief brewing, probably all ties in somewhere.\nFrom W: \"As I stated several times over the last year or two as well as in the interview last Friday I\u2019ve been tracking numbers including 111 and variations thereof 1111. 11-11-11 etc. a number of plane crashes have occurred on 111 and 1111 day cycles. There are 111 hr cycles in one particular market I also located several years ago soooooooo\u2026\u2026. I find this tender nugget quite tasty\u2026.\"\n\"The black moon event will take place in the early hours of Saturday morning at 1:11am (GMT) for those in the Western Hemisphere.The black moon will coincide with Halloween for those in the Eastern hemisphere.\"\nSignificant then that WikiLeaks is celebrating it\u2019s 10 year anniversary, of 10 million documents leaked, at 10am Berlin time?\nIt\u2019s easy with all that\u2019s happening to overlook that India and Pakistan are also as close to war as Russia and NATO. These nations have earlier generation atomic warheads.\non Monday we go into the Jewish year 5777\u2026 happy days!\nSharp eye there, that event could also explain the removal of Australians from the site.\nFront row seat to \u2018living in interesting times\u2019.\nI\u2019ve got the pop corn, any one with the beer?\nSo the rumour currently being floated now, mid-day on Friday, is that the DoJ is going to back down from the $14billion penalty that they were demanding from Deutsche. We\u2019ll see next week if that\u2019s just a rumor or not. If it\u2019s true, then yet again, a TBTF bank that helped power the 2008 mortgage crisis will get away with just a slap on the wrist.\nYa think DB\u2019s counter-party of JPMorgan had anything to do with that rumor????\nI would not be surprised if Shimon Peres died months ago and the big funeral in Israel is really just a big meeting to tweak their plans.\nSunday morning: An IT \"glitch\" prevents some Deutsche Bank customers in Germany from accessing both their cash at ATMs AND prevents their debit/credit cards from functioning in retail outlets for a few hours. Third \"glitch\" from DB within a few months. And really bad timing.\nASX up Monday with absolutely no mention of Deutsche Bank deal faux pas or Italian false account charges \u2013 WTF?!\nOct05: Judge rules lawsuits may proceed against gold, silver manipulators\u2026 specifically, HSBC and ScotiaBank:Quote:However, far more important, was her ruling that investors may pursue antitrust and manipulation claims against Bank of Nova Scotia (\"ScotiaBank\") and HSBC Holdings Plc, clearing the way for silver manipulation price-fixing litigation\u2026.As a result, \"the Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the open motions at docket numbers 73 and 75. Plaintiffs\u2019 deadline to show good cause why leave to replead should be granted is October 17, 2016.\"\nemployment of a manipulative device claimsbid-rigging, and unjust enrichment.price fixing and unlawful restraintprice manipulation claimsaiding and abetting and principal-agent claims.",

I am not that good at the Japanese language either but answering questions like that helps me learn more about it and I enjoy it. The same goes for English, I\u2019m still learning everyday. Thanks to the students.\nHey Jinhan! Thanks for the very nice reply you left me in the Nov 27 post \ud83d\ude42 I will definitely keep you updated of my JET endeavour. I have to say, my husband was very encouraged when he read your blog! Mainly it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t really know what to do when (if?) he comes to Japan, but had a rough idea after reading what you did \u2013 go to language school, get a student visa and then look for a job in Japan.\nI liked this post. Never really thought of the implications of the past tense present tense things but the last bit you wrote about students helping you learn English even more really resonates with me. I\u2019m doing my TESOL practicum next week and teaching Third Conditional. To prepare for my interview I\u2019m going to have to piah grammar. Still a bit fuzzy about the Perfect tenses. Sigh. It\u2019s such a surprise when you realise you can\u2019t explain something yet you know how it works. Students just don\u2019t accept \u201cIt\u2019s a rule, memorise it!\u201d anymore. They want to know why and thus you have to know why.\nI\u2019ve read your introduction post and we\u2019re quite similar! I fell in love with Japan when I was 11 and started teaching myself Japanese around the same time. I first started with a language CD-ROM which taught me phrases that I would repeat. I ended up with a lot of vocabulary and memorised sentences but no grasp of grammar. When I was 15 I enrolled myself in a small neighbourhood language school in Jurong East (it has since folded, hahaha) and tried a hand at formal lessons. It didn\u2019t work. I was bored most of the time in JLPT4 class and couldn\u2019t keep up in JLPT3, thanks to the disparity between my grammar and vocabulary skills. So I continued learning on my own. Never stopped since then \ud83d\ude00 Hopefully I would get a chance to do a Japanese course in Japan someday.\nI\u2019m so glad you say you\u2019re liking it more and more each day. Every time I tell people I plan to move to Japan, they tell me, \u201cLiving there and holidaying there is very different you know.\u201d (I reiterated this to my husband and he said, \u201c\u5e9f\u8bdd, of course it is different. They just can\u2019t find anything to say so they tell you that.\u201d LOL.) I think for people like you and me (who love Japan for seemingly inexplicable reasons) we can only like it more and more. Just because we want to live there so much we would gladly deal with things like key money, not having our phones ring on the train, bringing out \u71c3\u3048\u308b\u30b4\u30df only on Tuesdays (not sure about where you live though) and having to do everything in person (unlike Singapore, where you can even renew your passport online with a digital passport photo you snap with your Canon in front of your living room wall). Haha.\nEbisu! If you drink you should go to the Ebisu Beer Museum. Admission is free but you can pay 500 yen to go on a sampling tour, i.e. all the draft beer you can drink for 500 yen. I\u2019m not a huge fan of alcohol but I just like the taste of beer so I was really looking forward to the museum but it was closed when I went\u2026 My friends and I went on January 2 but it was closed till January 4. Haha. Kena sabo by Japanese holiday calendar. Oh well. If you drink beer at all, go visit the museum!\nThere are two Singaporean restaurants in Ebisu, one is in a building a distance away from the train station\u2019s West Exit \u2013 Sin Tong Kee (link here) \u2013 and another is in Ebisu Garden Place. That one is called Hainan Chi-Fan and has branches in other parts of Tokyo as well. The Akasaka branch has Singaporean staff, hahahaha. Here is the link. Sin Tong Kee was closed when I was there (again, victim of the Japanese New Year) but I went to Hainan Chi-Fan and I have to say it\u2019s decent. 950 yen to satisfy your food cravings, worth it what! Try to bring your own chicken rice chilli though. Haha.\nHey wow, you\u2019re doing TESOL! You really are doing all you can to get to come over, that\u2019s really great!\nYea, I could see that we\u2019re pretty similar except that you found your interest when you were much younger than when I found mine. Honestly, throughout my Japanese language learning journey, the worst period was when I took JLPT prep classes. For the regular classes, I always looked forward to the next class but for the JLPT prep classes, the mono-directional style of feeding us with grammar after grammar simply bored me so much, I totally lost interest in studying at one point in time, which was partly why I stopped studying the language for the next 5 years.\nYour husband\u2019s funny, and what he said is kinda true. I see that you do know a lot about Japan already. The 2 things that bother me a little here in Japan is the lack of trash cans and the need to sort our garbage. Sometimes I forget to take my \u4e0d\u71c3\u3054\u307f out and I\u2019d have to wait a full week before I can take it out. But like you said, it\u2019s all worth it. Being able to be here for such a small price, I\u2019ve got no complaints.\nThank you for telling me your email address, I shall drop you an email one of these days (hopefully over this weekend) and I\u2019ll definitely check out your blog! Last, there\u2019s nothing to apologise for. I appreciate your comments and you may not know this but what you wrote encouraged me a lot too and really made me feel that this is all worth it. I\u2019m really thankful you managed to chance upon my page that we could have this conversation.",

Sugar and Spice, and Everything Nice?\nBefore you answer that, meet The Classic City Roller Girls- a group of Athens girls who&apos;d&nbsp;love nothing more than to show you, and&nbsp;a packed arena of spectators, just exactly what they are made of.&nbsp;And I can go ahead and tell you, it is not sugar.\nThe Classic City Roller Girls are a tangy, tough team of fierce female athletes on skates, and often also, in fishnets and fake eyelashes. Today, the all-American contact sport of Roller Derby is revived and thriving among aggressive women all over the world. And Athens, GA, is no exception- with ever-expanding local interest making The Classic City Roller Girls impossible to ignore.\nI already knew a lot about the pop culture praise of the national Roller Derby scene when I heard about the Athens league, but after attending&nbsp;my first actual&nbsp;bout at the Athens Arena, I gained a whole new respect for the sport and the Classic&nbsp;City Roller Girls.&nbsp;Roller Derby is&nbsp;fully physical, highly energized, heart-pumpingly exciting, and just incredibly fun to watch. I have attended few sports&nbsp;events quite like a Roller Derby bout, and we are lucky enough in Athens, GA to have a dedicated team worth watching and cheering on manically from the stands.\nIn more focused moments of my Roller Derby viewing experience, I was able to stay quiet long enough to capture a few videos. Later, I&nbsp;was even&nbsp;able to interview&nbsp;a few of the Athens&apos; roller girls&nbsp;myself.&nbsp;The video account of my first Classic City Roller Girls and Roller&nbsp;Derby bout experience are below for your viewing enjoyment.\nThere may not be a home football game in Athens this weekend, but there will certainly be a high energy sporting event worthy of your support taking place- Don&apos;t miss your chance to see the Classic City Roller Girls face off against the Atlanta Roller Girl&apos;s Jukes of Hazard at this Saturday&apos;s Fall Brawl at the Athens Arena - Saturday, September 24th at 7 p.m. | Tickets can be purchased at the door for $12 (adults), $5 (kids 6-10), &amp; free admission for children 5 and under. Advance tickets can be purchased here for only $10.",

    "text": "INDIRA DEVI, born to wealth, luxury and culture and refined to her finger-tips, came, unaccountably, to be dogged by other-worldliness which gave her no peace till she met her \u2018destined Guru\u2019, as she puts it, in Sri Dilip Kumar Roy who advised her to accept Sri Aurobindo as her Guide in 1949. But she refused and the great Sage counselled Dilip Kumar to accept her and wrote that she was an aspirant of \u201cadvanced spiritual consciousness\u201d whose \u201csamadhi was of the savikalpa kind\u201d, and nature highly psychic and receptive. After founding the Han Krishna Mandir Ashram at Poona under the aegis of her accepted Guru, she began, at his instance, to write about her experiences and evolution in Yoga to two American brother-aspirants, Richard Miller and Don Taxay, who had adopted India as their spiritual home. These letters form the first Part of the present volume. The second consists of letters written by Dilip Kumar and others about the happenings in Han Krishna Mandir and about the saints and sages and spiritual life in general. These have been edited finally by Dilip Kumar as a tribute to Indira Devi on her birthday this year 1964, with the one aim: to attest the last Rality, vivid and large as life, which answers all true aspiration with its boon of bhakti and adoration of Lord Krishna who \u201cmanifests His Love through Beauty to lead us to Bilss.\u201d.\nTranslator\u2019s apology: I was deeply impressed by His Holiness Sri Mahanam\u2019s twin books on the Gita and Sri Gouranga. So I wrote to him. He complied with my request and sent me this Preface (in Bengali) to serve as a Foreword to Indira Devi\u2019s Letters, translated into Bengali by myself and published in Calcutta last year. While gratefully acknowledging the debt, I asked His Holiness to translate his Foreword into English for the present edition. In reply he suggested I myself undertake the task. I have availed myself of his permission but with deep diffidence, as I am fully alive to the impossibility of doing justice to his inimitable style in an English translation, the more so as many of the images and similes which star his poetic prose can never retain their savour and ambiance in a language like English whose genius and temperament are very different from Bengali. So, I hope His Holiness will forgive me for having been forced to be somewhat free at places in my translation, as also for omitting a few passages I could not cope with. I have also taken the liberty of adding two quotations: one from Indira Dcvi\u2019s 14th Letter and the other from Sri Aurobindo\u2019s Savitri - at the tail-end. His Holiness has written in Bengali: \u201cManush pabe divyatanu\u201d. But although it sounds perfect in our language, to translate it literally with \u201cMan shall have a celestial body\u201d would have sounded very much like an anticlimax in English, especially in a closing sentence.\nIt has been said that an authentic God-seeker\u2019s life dates from the moment he is initiated in Yoga, that is, when his soul is born spiritually. As I believe this, I will refrain from writing Indira Devi\u2019s biography by way of preface even though she is the central figure in The Flute Calls Still. I have done my humble best to tell here how His Flute called her and, how again, after answering its call, she became a flute in His hands, as His Holiness Sri Mahanamavrata has put it so aptly. Still, many who have appealed to me to write about her life in the past are likely to be disappointed. I can only console them by stressing that I have portrayed, through others\u2019 letters and mine, her spiritual evolution and stature in the second part of the volume entitled, Our Mandir. In its pages, however, I have tried to keep myself in the background, because I want all that I have penned or edited to be taken, by and large, as a history of and tribute to her rapid blossoming in the light of the spirit \u2014 a blossoming as incredible as it is indubitable - by which I wish to underline her astonishing Aspiration (referred to by Ruth St. Dennis, the famous dancer) which outpetalled with such breathtaking swiftness since her spiritual birth in 1949.\n\u201cThe greatest aspiration and joy of the little drop of rain is to lose itself in the river for it knows that only by losing it can gain.\nI feel tempted to go on for pages and pages, quoting her spontaneous reactions to the lore of Guruvad if only to show how they are all on fours with the findings of our forbears, but since that is not possible, I will conclude with a short account of what is perhaps the most remarkable and singular feature of her spiritual evolution, to wit, her relationship with Mirabai of hallowed fame, who has been singing to her moving songs on love divine day, after thrilling day, from the year of her initiation in Yoga: 1949.\nThese lovely songs (which have already added up to more than 800 in number) she heard in her samadhi, a miracle, indeed, of the first water, hut what is a still greater miracle is that she remembered everytime the words and recited them verbatim! And, as this is, assuredly, the most abiding divine miracle I have witnessed in my life so far, I cannot, for fear of being scoffed at, fight shy of writing at some length about this breath-taking phenomenon. Were space at my disposal I could have easily written a hundred pages and still feel I have not said enough; but as that is neither feasible nor advisable, may I be permitted to quote my own Preface to a sheaf of her songs entitled, Pujanjali which was printed here in Pune three years ago in Sindhi script.\nThen she began to see, in her vision, a lovely lady in Rajput dress who sang to her beautiful devotional songs in a voice athrob with loves yearning and pain \u2014 viraha. Once, at my request, she wrote about it all in a letter dated August 19, 1950, from Mussourie where she used to meditate daily from eight to ten hours.\n\u201cI am writing this in the small hours of the morning after having just woken up from my meditation which lasted about five hours.\n\u201cMira came to me again. 0 Dada, how dear she has grown to me and how near! How real Her love and how close she is to my heart! And yet isn\u2019t it all but incredible? To think that one so holy, who comes to me in my dreams and trances, should be growing as it were with my own growth! ... I am told that people simply will not believe me. I can only smile.Now that I have seen and loved Her, could it matter to me one jot or tittle, even if the whole world were to laugh at my experience ? A mere dream? But can a mere dream give one more lasting peace and sustenance of love than all the realities of the world put together? O Dada, I shall always be grateful to you, for it is because of your blessing, your meditation, that she came to me and loved me as she has. And how precious is Her Love! I wish you could see Her! She is lovely and her beauty grows on one. But I cannot make her out. I asked Her the other day: But tell me, are you really real? She placed herpalm on my head in token of blessing and smiled again and said: But do you know yourself, the real you ? I will tell you more about it all when you come next to Mussourie . But one thing I may tell you now as certain: that she will never forsake me even if the whole world does.\nNext followed a series of thrilling mystic experiences after which she began, lo, to remember the songs which, in her trances, she had heard Mira sing. As she started dictating these songs and I went on in delight, taking them down, I could no longer doubt their authenticity: the lady who continued to visit Indira I her Samadhi could be no other than the famous Mira Bai, Queen of Mevar, whose life \u2013 history had crystallized into a haloed legend centuries ago.\nWhile in Pondicherry, I first published in 1950, 165 of her songs entitled Shrutanjali meaning an offering of songs heard\u201d. Thereafter, in 1953, Premanjali (with 95 songs) saw the light, to be succeeded, in 1958, by Sudhanjali with 183 songs, and lastly, in 1960, by Deepanjali with 167 songs, making up a sum total of 610 songs in all, of which about 600 were heard and dictated by her, a phenomenal feat in all conscience! And 200 more such songs remain still to be published.\n\u201cWhenever he was in a state of ecstasy he would burst forth into song and one of the fellow-seekers, sitting by, would take them down.\u201d These were later approved by the poet-mystic who said: \u2018This is my nuska\u201d (a physician\u2019s prescription for the malady of life) (Divine Dwellers in the Desert pp. 47-48).\nTo conclude with the comment of Sri Aurobindo (and who could be a greater authority on authentic mysticism ancient or modem?) He wrote to me three letters when I sent him a few of Indira\u2019s songs with an elaborate\u2019 account of how they were inspired and conveyed.\n(7.5.1950) \u201cIt is evident,\u201d he further explained in his second letter, \u201cthat Indira is receiving inspiration for her Hindi songs from the Mira of her vision and that her consciousness and the consciousness of Mira are collaborating on some plane superconscient to the ordinary human mind: an occult plane; also, this influence is not an illusion but a reality, otherwise the thing could not happen as it does in actual fact. Such things do happen on the occult plane, they are not new and unprecedented.\u201d(2-6-1950).\nFor the rest, I need only add that I am sure that these songs will go on inspiring \u2014 irrespective of caste and creed, race or religion \u2014 all true devotees and aspirants who need the light of Love Divine to help them tread the Path that leads to the Peak of soul\u2019s fulfilment in this world of perfidious phantoms and false glimmers that end only in the Abyss.\nIn the foreword we are told that this book \u2014 containing 167 Hindi bhajans and 33 English translations - is the fourth collection of Indira Devi\u2019s devotional songs, which has been rightly compared with Mira\u2019s songs.\nIn these words the Yogi Anirvan has very correctly described Indira Devi\u2019s songs and her complete dedication to Krishna. Mira used to consider herself an incarnation of Lalita a dear sakhi of Sri Radha who was the greatest devotee of Krishna. Therefore, it is not at all out of place that Indira Devi equally deeply in love with Krishna, should be considered by Shri Dilip Kumar Roy \u2018in contact with Mira, singing\u2019. In such rapturous moods, almost in trance, she dictates the songs with tears in her eyes, conveying the pure message of Mira\u2019s world-oblivious love for Krishna. It is the purest devotion of an inspired soul and complete dedication that is manifested in the bhajans of Indira Devi: It is true that nobody can say whence arises this mystic longing, this overwhelming aspiration for self- surrender; but one can see it in Indira Devi and in her songs. Her whole personality is surcharged with love for love\u2019s sake .... ahetuk prem .... which knows only love and wants nothing in reward, not even moksha \u2014 salvation. She considers human bodies or moulds as the pradips (clay lamps) and holds that we do not count till we make our lives into lamps to manifest the Lord\u2019s Light.\nAs I am bringing out The Flute Calls Still, by and large to pay the deep debt I owe to Indira Devi, but for whom Han Krishna Mandir, with the yugala-vigraha of Radha-Krishna, would never have come into being, any more than the vista of an undreamt of world of the Saint Mirabai\u2019s personality, parables and inspiration would have opened before me (initiating for me a totally new phase of sadhana, blest by Radha, Krishna and Guru), I should like to add one word more before I conclude: namely, that now-a-days she not only recites Mira\u2019s songs verbatim \u2014 for me to take down \u2014 but can, as often as not, reproduce also some of the beautiful and original tunes in which she has heard Mira sing them. A few of the tunes are quite new in style arid movement, so much so, that sometimes I have had to take them down in notation before I could sing them correctly. Someday, God willing, I hope to be able to publish some of these lovely airs to prove my contention \u2014 the airs that we sing almost daily in chorus in our temple \u2014 bhajans as well as namakirtans, and ever so many respond to them whole-heartedly. This I mention not only because it is a fresh miracle in itself (since Indira when she came to Pondicherry could not sing at all) but also because I look upon the achievement as a veritable landmark in the evolution of her many-mooded personality.",

I had pages from some of the meet and greeters and some of my newsclippings from when MMMBop was released back in 1997. The theme of the album was \u201cten\u201d as it was 10 years since MMMBop and Middle of Nowhere was released.\nwent down the queue outside the venue and had fans sign it.\nA 12\u00d76 album I made about the 2007 concert. These are just a few of the pages. I used left over supplies from the album I made the guys.\nAgain, using left over supplies from the album I made for the guys, I made this double layout for one of my regular scrapbooks about the Meet and Greet. The left page shows the picture of us and the guys, and the right page features my M&G pass, miniature version of the album I made for Hanson using scans I made of it (minus the fans signatures in the back), and I mounted the flier of the UK tour on hinges which I put a pocket containing my ticket and M&G e-mail and my account of the whole experience behind it.\nMade using the free digital kit download, I went to my local scrapbook store with a print of the patterned paper to compare it to the cardstock being sold so I could buy the closest colours to the kit. I used my craft robo to cut the Hanson logo 2010 for the cover (thank you Hansonish.com!) I also used my Hanson journalling blocks, American crafts thickers (on \u201cZac\u201d and \u201cMeiko\u201d) and Making Memories letter stickers (on \u201cTaylor\u201d) to add the finishing touches to the pages \ud83d\ude42 The whole book is stitch bound with wax thread.",

    "text": "This topic contains 9 replies, has 4 voices, and was last updated by Shan Gao 4 years, 5 months ago.\nGiven the debate over the meaning of the wavefunction, an examination of the original motivations of the Schrodinger equation is of plausible relevance \u2014 and arguably of reasonable significance. This short essay notes that two key components of Schrodinger\u2019s 1926 papers rely crucially on epistemic concepts from classical physics. (In other words, classical physics concepts that are ill-defined from an omniscient viewpoint, but are only useful/meaningful from the perspective of an agent with limited information.) This would seem to bolster the \u201c\\psi-epistemic\u201d view of treating the wavefunction as a state of knowledge instead of a description of reality.\nSchrodinger\u2019s original presentation of his time-dependent equation bestows a crucially important role to Hamilton\u2019s Principal Function, W (as do many other subsequent arguments that start with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation). But even though W is often simply called \u201cthe action\u201d, it is *not* the (ontological) action, but instead a summary of many possible but flatly-incompatible classical histories. W might be useful as a state of knowledge, but it would be very strange to build an ontology out of it.\nOne of the strange aspects of W has been discussed at length, here and elsewhere: the fact that W lives in configuration space rather than spacetime, at least for more than one particle. But it is generally not been noted that an ontic-W would much stranger than the mere space that it resides in. Even for single-particles it is essentially an epistemic tool, and this is clearly the case in the classical domain in which W originated. This certainly doesn\u2019t prove that the wavefunction must be epistemic as well, but it adds to the many excellent arguments in that regard (Spekkens, Fuchs, etc.). It also cautions one against drawing on the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for addressing foundational questions at the deepest level.\nObviously, this paper is quite short; had I had more time to work on it I might have pointed out one more curious feature about W: Even though a classical W quickly devolves into epistemic uncertainty as time progresses, it can easily be made to start out ontically, by choosing a reference point in spacetime where a particle has been measured to actually exist. Here, then, is an example of a classical structure that naturally evolves from being \u201contic\u201d at preparation to being \u201cepistemic\u201d at measurement. (It is at measurement where the best arguments for the psi-epistemic viewpoint reside.) As a final note; the PBR theorem examines the status of the wavefunction at *preparation*, and determines it is ontic. And yet few people have examined models in which the wavefunction makes an ontic-to-epistemic transition (where the probability overlap between states grows with time). Hamilton\u2019s Principal Function is then a proof-of-principle that such cases deserve consideration, especially considering that W was the original motivation for \\psi.\nI\u2019m trying to understand your new point about the ontic to epistemic transition.\nIn the classical case, is W ontic because measuring a particle at xsub0, tsub0 uniquely specifies W at all x,t (making it look like a physical field)?\nIf so, how does it become epistemic? Is that because the initial velocity was not specified/measured, so at a later time tsub1, no xsub1 is singled out to give a unique time, position pair to take the place of xsub0, tsub0 in specifying the new W(x,t)?\nThanks for the question\u2026 and yes, that\u2019s essentially correct.\nAt a big-picture level, looking at the whole history of W(x,t) vs. some particular classical particle trajectory, I would say that W is epistemic in the only ways that really matter: many different W\u2019s are compatible with the same actual classical trajectory (depending on the reference point), just about any ontic trajectory is compatible with the same W, and upon learning more details about the actual trajectory, one can update W.\nBut then, at future times, before a second measurement is made, the possible locations explode; you can\u2019t determine W by looking at the actual particle position (at that later time only), and you certainly can\u2019t determine the actual particle position from W. And if you did gain new information, you might choose to update your W to a new reference point.\nAs you can tell, I don\u2019t think slicing up the history into instants and using the standard epistemic/ontic definition is particularly useful. In fact, in might even be misleading, in that it has steered people away from the important point that \u201contic\u201d at preparation may still be essentially epistemic in all the ways that really matter \u2014 at least when it comes to \\psi.\nI don\u2019t understand this comment. PBR employs prepare-and-measure experiments, but the lambda could refer to the ontic state of the system at any point between the preparation and measurement. I do not see why it is necessarily at preparation.\nBut on your main argument, it seems to me that W(x,t) is encoding information about the laws of physics, i.e. about what the trajectory would have been if the initial conditions were different. I think this makes it nomological in the sense of Valia\u2019s talk, rather than epistemic. I would normally think of the laws of physics as ontological in the sense appropriate for things like the PBR theorem.\nMore generally, I am not sure if making a historical argument is the best tack to take in defending psi-epistemicism. Schroedinger was obviously conflicted on the issue for some time, given that he also tried to get a pure wave formulation of quantum theory without the Born rule to work for some time. If the many-worlders had made the argument that psi has to be real because early quantum theorists like Schroedinger intended it to be real then it would certianly be worth pointing out that this is not necessarily true. However, I think the argument they actually make is: the structure of quantum theory as it now exists should be our guide for determining what is real. Since that structure includes the wavefunction, the most straightforward explanation for the success of quantum theory is to posit that the wavefunction is real and go from there. Although I don\u2019t think this is a great argument, it seems to be independent from the historical developmemnt of the theory.\nThis is an intriguing paper. It proposes some interesting novel ideas.\nI have two general concerns. One is that the similarity between two math equations seems not to ensure these two equations have the same physical interpretation, as in the case of Nelson\u2019s stochastic mechanics. The other is that Schrodinger\u2019s original derivation of his equation is only a heuristic derivation. So, it seems debatable to draw fundamental physical implications from the derivation.\nOn the status of W(x,t), I don\u2019t really see a meaningful distinction between those two options; the important aspects of \u201cepistemic\u201d that I\u2019m interested in are outlined in my response to Richard above. (I agree that W is a summary of many possibilities, but even so, one would never treat the phase-fronts of W as a real wave\u2026?) Maybe it would seem more \u201cepistemic\u201d by your lights if you considered realistic non-classical trajectories, as outlined on the top of page 2. In that case, W would only summarize our best guess of the trajectory, assuming we didn\u2019t know how the actual trajectory would deviate from classical physics.\nThanks for your kind words; and I certainly agree with both of your points.\nI happen to think that having two wildly different interpretations of the mathematics of configuration space in particular (stat mech vs Everettian QM) is quite unlikely, but sure, it\u2019s certainly possible. I\u2019m one of those few realists who think we can force multiparticle QM back into ordinary spacetime (via retrocausality, see ref. ), so I happen to like the stat-mech-style account. I actually quite like classical fields, so I\u2019m not *as* opposed to entities like W(x,t) as it might appear, but I would like there to be more focus on *relativistic* classical fields, not the W-like fields that obey Hamilton-Jacobi-style equations.\nAs for the fact that the motivation was only heuristic, I agree that that makes my point even weaker, but I hope the point remains that Schrodinger was still appropriating *concepts* from the non-ontic sector of classical physics.\nI\u2019m also one of those (few?) realists who think we can force multiparticle QM back into ordinary spacetime (via random discontinuous motion of particles, in my case).",

    "text": "ZIMBABWE \u2013 Three more Mutare police officers have had their salaries garnished to pay a total of $900 damages after they broke into a cellphone technician\u2019s house at night and beat him up for allegedly stealing some property.\nThe payments from the officers will compensate the victim.\nConstables Christopher Kanyemba, Chenjerai Muzuva and Talent Mutede of Chikanga Police Station, broke the bedroom door and pounced on Mr Prince Mbofana who was lying naked with his wife before force-marching him to the police station.\nThe garnishee orders were issued barely a fortnight after another constable at Zimunya Police Station in Mutare, brutally assaulted and unlawfully arrested a villager.\nHe was sued and ordered to pay the victim $1007 as compensation.\nThe flood of lawsuits against police officers in their personal capacities stems from Section 50(9) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, which makes all abusive and overzealous police officers liable for their own illegal actions.\n\u201cAny person who has been illegally arrested or detained is entitled to compensation from the person responsible for the arrest or detention, but a law may protect the following persons from liability under this section: a) a judicial officer acting in a judicial capacity reasonably and in good faith, b) any other public officer acting reasonably and in good faith and without culpable ignorance or negligence\u201d.\nIn terms of the Constitution, those public officers who unlawfully detain or arrest people are liable to personal lawsuits.\nThe law only protects police officers acting reasonably and in good faith.\nA Mutare magistrate Mrs Yeukai Chigodora ruled against Kanyemba, Muzuva and Mutede in the civil claim and ordered them to pay $900 in damages for unlawful arrest, pain and suffering caused on Mr Mbofana.\nIn terms of a garnishee order issued on February 1 this year, the three will pay $300 each to Mr Mbofana.\nThey will each have $50 deducted from their monthly salaries for five months.\nMrs Peggy Tavagadza of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights represented Mr Mbofana in the court case.\nA total of $150 ($50 from each police officer) will be transferred into Mr Mbofana\u2019s CBZ Bank account monthly.\nMr Mbofana told the court that he was severely assaulted by the three at the police station on March 3 last year.\nHe told the court that the police broke into his house at midnight but later released him without any charge around 5am the following day.\nMr Mbofana sustained injuries and the police gave him a letter to enable him to go for treatment.\nThe police officers, in their defence, argued that they were acting in good faith and they picked Mr Mbofana up following tip-offs from the suggestion boxes that he had stolen some property.\nHowever, the magistrate found that the police officers were not acting in good faith and that they were abusing their powers in the unlawful arrest, detention and assault.\n\u201cThe plaintiff managed to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities,\u201d said Mrs Chigodora. \u201cTo start with, the defendants do not deny they detained plaintiff from midnight to 5:30am. Neither do they deny that he was released without any charge.\nMrs Chigodora said the police officers confirmed knowing Mr Mbofana prior to the arrest and where he stayed, hence there was no justification in raiding him at midnight.\n\u201cMore so, if defendants wanted to interview the plaintiff, I see no reason why they had to take him at midnight considering that they admitted they only looked for him once in the afternoon and failed to find him,\u201d she said.\nThis comes after Constable Tafara Depute of Zimunya Police Station, who brutally assaulted a villager and subjected him to unlawful arrest and detention, will, for the next 10 months, have $100 deducted from his monthly salary to pay up damages of $1 007.\nA Mutare man Mr Samson Jackson, who was once arrested at Zimunya Police Station for insulting some Zanu-PF officials, sued the policeman after being brutally assaulted.\nIn a related case, a Bindura University student Mr Luckson Munyai is suing the police for $51 503 after he was assaulted and broke an arm.\nHe sued then Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi, Commissioner General Augustine Chihuri, Inspector Mutizwa and Sergeant Nleya in their official capacities.\nThe case is yet to be set down for hearing at the High Court.",

Monson's empty seat during the afternoon session of the 187th Annual General Conference at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City Saturday, April 1, 2017. Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune Elder Neil L. Andersen, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, speaks during the afternoon session of the 187th Annual General Conference at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City Saturday, April 1, 2017.\nHolland was among more than a dozen speakers who addressed tens of thousands of Mormons in downtown Salt Lake City and millions more around the world, tuned into the LDS Church&apos;s 187th Annual General Conference.\nOne voice the faithful didn&apos;t hear during the morning and afternoon sessions was that of LDS Church President Thomas S. Monson. The increasingly frail 89-year-old leader presided over the morning gathering after being helped to his seat.\nIn the afternoon, that chair \u0097 between Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. Uchtdorf, his two counselors in the governing First Presidency \u0097 sat noticeably vacant.\nA spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Monson, viewed by Mormons as a \"prophet, seer and revelator,\" was \"conserving his energy\" for the remainder of the weekend&apos;s sessions.\nTwo years ago, the Utah-based religion announced Monson was \"feeling the effects of advancing age.\" Since then, the longtime LDS leader, who also didn&apos;t attend last Saturday&apos;s women&apos;s meeting, has been scaling back his conference sermons.\nThe former president of LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University pleaded with members to stay in the faith&apos;s expanding fold.\nDuring that time, he also witnessed the \"ugliness of prejudice and discrimination suffered by those who are targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\"\nIn LDS history, Mormons were persecuted for their faith, Renlund noted. \"How ironically sad it would be if we were to treat others as we have been treated. ... Let us fully mirror [Jesus&apos;] love and love one another so openly and completely that no one feels abandoned, alone or hopeless.\"\nEyring, who spoke first Saturday, addressed Mormons&apos; theological drive to seek out their ancestors \u0097 a practice they believe opens the door of the LDS gospel to long dead kin \u0097 and the growing fascination with genealogy among millions of others.\n\"Interest in exploring one&apos;s family history has grown exponentially. At ever-increasing rates, people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity,\" he said. \"Genealogical libraries, associations and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest.\"\nHe said the \"hearts of the children \u0097 you and me \u0097 have turned to our fathers, our ancestors. The affection you feel for your ancestors is ... deeply seated in your sense of who you are. But it has to do with more than just inherited DNA.\"\nThe morning&apos;s concluding speaker was Russell M. Nelson, senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and next in the line for the church presidency.\nNelson touted the power of faith to change lives.\n\"True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from people of the world,\" the 92-year-old leader said. Faith \"propels us to do things we otherwise would not do. Faith that motivates us to action gives us more access to his power.\"\nWhen believers \"reach up for the Lord&apos;s power ... with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air,\" Nelson promised, \"power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the savior knows you truly want to reach up to him \u0097 when he can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw his power into your life \u0097 you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you need to do.\"\nIn the afternoon, apostle Neil L. Andersen emphasized the importance of \"overcoming the world,\" rising above earthly concerns and focusing on God.\n\"Overcoming the world is not a global invasion, but a private, personal battle, requiring hand-to-hand combat with our own internal foes,\" Andersen said. \"The world, on the other hand, is more interested in indulging the natural man than in subduing him.\"\nOne of those indulgences is social media. \"A disciple of Christ is not alarmed if a post about her faith does not receive 1,000 likes or even a few friendly emojis,\" Andersen said. \"Overcoming the world is less concerned with our online connections and more concerned with our heavenly connection to God.\"\nFellow apostle M. Russell Ballard advised the faithful to set goals for their lives and make plans to achieve them, \"within the framework of our Heavenly Father&apos;s eternal plan.\"\nThe most important aims, he said, are \"to return to [God&apos;s] presence and to receive the eternal blessings that come from making and keeping covenants.\"\nBallard warned about \"loud voices\" used by Satan \u0097 including the mass media, the internet and social media \u0097 \"that seek to drown out the small and still voice of the Holy Spirit that can show us &apos;all things&apos; we should do to return and receive.\"\n\"We must keep the doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of our goals and plans,\" Ballard said. \"Without him, no eternal goal is possible, and our plans to achieve our eternal goals will surely fail.\"\nNo women spoke Saturday, but three new female leaders were named to lead the women&apos;s Relief Society.\nEditor David Noyce and reporter Sean P. Means contributed to this story.",

The country is politically very unstable.\nThe Reform message entered the country in 1939 with Pastor Carlos Kozel\u2019s visit; and one year later, in 1940, two Peruvian missionaries (Brothers Jos\u00e9 Carmen Le\u00f3n and Heraclio Begazo) were sent to work in the country. By 1943 there were 30 interested souls attending church services. After the first church was organized in the capital city of La Paz, the message was taken to most cities. On December 23, 1963, the Bolivian Field of the Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement was legally registered as a missionary fields of the General Conference with its headquarters in Germany at the time.\nIn 1975, the General Conference put the Bolivian Field under the management of the Peruvian Union; and then in 1986 Bolivia once again became a missionary field under the General Conference.\nFrom January 1992 to 1995, when there were already 324 members, the church had a collapse that brought about great difficulties. Only 205 members remained firm in the true faith. Due to this problem, the work started over with three churches, one vehicle, and 10% of the publications of the publishing house. The situation was very precarious.\nBut now, thanks to God and the sacrifices made by local and foreign Bible workers and pastors, the Bolivian Field has 317 members and was recently organized as a Union. Although it is weak financially, some donations and the cooperation of our brethren have made it possible for the Union to purchase a piece of land measuring 1,700 square meters (18,299 square feet) in the city of Cochabamba for the purpose of constructing a headquarters building.\nWe appeal to all the believers in the world to help us carry out our construction plans, for we cannot do this by ourselves. As it is written, \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d Acts 20:35. \u201cSelf-denial will bring into the treasury of God the means necessary to advance His work. Thus we may act in copartnership with Christ.\u201d \u2013In Heavenly Places, p. 300.\nMay your offerings be very special for the work of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We pray that He will multiply what you generously give for His cause in this place.",

    "text": "The Admirals lost 3-2 in overtime on the road against the San Antonio Rampage Wednesday night. Despite generating plenty of offensive chances the Admirals were forced to comeback twice in this game before losing in overtime. It is the Admirals first point gained after losing 5-1 to the Oklahoma City Barons the previous two outings yet there is a feeling that the Ads could just have easily taken the full haul tonight in San Antonio.\nAfter a very tightly defended game the scoring broke open 14:58 into the second period from yet another shorthanded goal allowed by the Admirals. Brett Olson somehow wired a long range wrist shot from the far right wing wall against the grain of Marek Mazanec and up and over his glove side to tally his eleventh goal of the season. It\u2019s the ninth shorthanded goal allowed by the Admirals this season.\nThe Admirals power-play pressure picked up following the shorthanded goal and, with Jonathan Racine fresh out of the box, the Ads answered right back. Johan Alm was able to secure a keep in on the left point and threw a low shot in on Michael Houser. The puck kicked out right to Mark Van Guilder who scored his eighth goal of the season on his milestone night as he became the Milwaukee Admirals most tenured player in the AHL era of the franchise in tonight\u2019s game.\nSan Antonio went back out in front with a goal from Dany Heatley in the third period. A great rush through the neutral zone by Jesse Blacker led to a drop off for Heatley who dropped off for the trailing Corban Knight who went forehand to backhand as he passed right back to the net front drive of Heatley. The shot attempt from the veteran sniper was fanned on but the puck went in off of his skate for his first goal since joining the Rampage.\nLess than three minutes later the Admirals were able to equalize through Austin Watson\u2019s twentieth goal of the season. Viktor Arvidsson had a slap shot attempt from the left wing faceoff dot but his stick exploded. As the puck rolled down behind the net Watson took a quick swipe on net and managed to bank a shot off of Houser and in. It is Watson\u2019s third consecutive season of scoring twenty or more goals with the Admirals.\nIt took overtime to decide this game and, sadly, the lone point was all that the Admirals managed to earn tonight. Just eighteen seconds into the overtime period and a great series in attack for the Rampage teed up Blacker for a rifled shot in tight to Mazanec from the left wing and he buried his sixth goal of the season to end this game at 3-2.\nThere were certainly far more positives than negatives on this night for the Admirals. They mustered up thirty-five shots on Houser and held the Rampage to only twenty four shots on goal. Defensively things were far better than they were as early as last night\u2019s game and it gives them something to build on for this weekend\u2019s games against the Texas Stars.\nRamblings: Tonight\u2019s scratches for the Admirals included Mike Liambas (right-leg laceration), Miikka Salomaki (upper-body), and Jonathan Diaby (healthy).\nThoughts on tonight\u2019s performance? Loss aside, was this a much improved effort by the Admirals than last night? Can you credit this as a solid game by Michael Houser that stifled the Admirals shooters? Why are the Admirals allowing so many shorthanded goals?\nNot sure if it\u2019s been mentioned on here or not, but per Aaron Sims on Twitter, Salomacki is out for the rest of the year.\nSteve C: Followed up on that and can confirm that.",

    "text": "A number of foreign investors exited strategic partnerships with local banks last year.\nMore than a decade after Vietnam tried to increase the efficiency of local banks without disrupting the human capital and knowledge embedded in existing structures, under a policy of \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d, divestitures of minority stakes in important local banks by several foreign investors last year put an end to the hotly-debated policy. Despite the shifts in mission among these foreign lenders, with their long-term commitments reportedly remaining unchanged, consecutive divestments by foreign banks in a single year raised many questions, especially when the easing of restrictions on foreign bank ownership and the positive track taken towards resolving bad debts added to the dynamism in Vietnam\u2019s banking sector over recent years.\nVietnam has seen a growing number of foreign banks withdraw from its under-banked economy, the latest indication that all might not be as well as bankers often claim. Last July, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) sold its branch in Ho Chi Minh City - a presence it had maintained since 2008 - to VIB. In the fourth quarter, HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered Public Co. offloaded their shareholdings in Techcombank and ACB, respectively, while ANZ shut its doors in a transaction that transferred two retail branches, six transaction offices, and 125,000 individual customers to Shinhan Bank Vietnam.\nThe four divestments seem reasonable on the surface. HSBC, CBA, and Standard Chartered established wholly-owned subsidiaries in the country, meaning that their Techcombank, VIB, and ACB stakes were no longer necessary for exposure to Vietnam\u2019s banking sector. In ANZ\u2019s case, its business focus in Asia has reportedly shifted to institutional banking, so the divestment of its retail banking business in Vietnam can be viewed as being in line with its change in strategy.\nThe trend of foreign banks fleeing Vietnamese banks was because the partnership didn\u2019t bring the desired profits, while the low foreign ownership limit seemingly discouraged the majority of foreign investors from continuing to inject capital into Vietnam-based commercial banks due to the little say given them in the banks\u2019 decision-making process, banking expert Mr. Nguyen Tri Hieu told VET. \u201cAs long as this cap remains shy of 50 per cent, foreign investors will not be able to sway the decision-making process or the banks\u2019 Boards of Directors and they will not be capable of gaining any substantial investment benefits from a strategic partnership,\u201d Mr. Hieu said.\nIn addition to governance challenges, potential risks arising from bad debts were specified by think-tankers as a cause of the decline in attractiveness of Vietnam\u2019s banking sector. \u201cBad debt resolution remains slow because of the lack of necessary regulations, debt trading platforms, or alternative solutions such as securitization,\u201d Director of the Vietnam Centre for Economic and Policy Research, Mr. Nguyen Duc Thanh, told VET, adding that the delay, while perhaps easing existing pressure on recapitalization, would increase the size of necessary future recapitalizations. \u201cA possible solution would be to offer more equity to incumbent and/or new foreign investors,\u201d he said.\nInvestment bankers believe the changing nature of the global banking industry and the disruptive influence of financial technology (fintech) also means foreign banks are less-willing partners than they were some years ago. The aftermath of the Asian financial crisis also taught many banks that minority stakes and subsequent technology transfers only created more formidable domestic competitors. \u201cInternational banks are less likely to look at a minority investment in a local bank because of the capital impact under Basel III,\u201d Mr. Rehan Anwer, Managing Director and Head of Frontier Markers at Credit Suisse, noted.\nBut there is growing interest from private equity and sovereign wealth funds. VinaCapital\u2019s flagship fund, the Vietnam Opportunity Fund (VOF), in October invested some $11 million in the Orient Commercial Bank (OCB), for an interest of less than 5 per cent, with Managing Director of VOF and Chief Investment Officer of the asset management firm Mr. Andy Ho saying that the \u201cinvestment is a rare opportunity to own a meaningful stake in a bank that has high lending and earnings growth.\u201d The transaction came shortly before the French banking group BNP Paribas offloaded its entire stake of over 74.7 million shares, or 18.68 per cent of capital, in OCB in December, ending a ten-year alliance between the two.\nThe capital flights have taken place despite last year\u2019s strong performance by domestic banks in profit generation as the industry continued to put the mini-crisis of 2012 behind it. \u201cWith a history of retaining profits with zero dividend payouts to preserve capital to support growth, Techcombank has adopted a balanced approach towards profit enhancement and risk-taking,\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service lead analyst, Ms. Daphne Cheng, told VET. The bank has rebounded significantly during the last three years, with 2017 pre-tax profit coming in at more than VND8 trillion ($352 million), the third consecutive year the figure has doubled from that of the previous year, while increases in return on equity (ROE) to 30.7 per cent and return on assets (ROA) to 2.69 per cent last year outperformed the entire local banking sector. Foreign banks, meanwhile, are still to announce their results.\nAs one of only a few that has fully resolved its bad debts sold to the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC) in 2013, the bank is pursuing a retail-focused strategy, particularly among the affluent, while downsizing its chunky corporate exposures to enhance yields. It is also considering downsizing its real estate and construction exposure to de-risk its loan book, while its stable deposit base is backed by a sizable contribution from the retail segment, which underpins its funding profile. The bank, which saw its rating revised by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) in September to stable from negative, is set to maintain its status as a leading privately-owned bank over the next 12 months with an entrenched retail franchise and above-average profitability.\nFor Hanoi-based lender ACB, the shadow of a difficult 2012 and litigation issues related to one of the bank\u2019s major shareholders have been replaced by a successful write-down of its VAMC bonds exposures in the fourth quarter of 2017, thanks to a series of decisive measures to clean up its balance sheet and gradual progress made in the resolution of legacy assets. With a credit extension strategy that focuses on the retail segment amid strongly increasing demand for household consumption, the last 12 months proved to be one of the bank\u2019s very best periods. By end-2017, total assets had grown by 22 per cent against 2016, deposits 17 per cent, and total pre-tax profits a staggering 60 per cent to VND2.1 trillion ($92.4 million).\nBoth VIB and OCB have stepped up their game of late. While the former remains among the group of banks with the highest financial strength in the local banking industry, as rated by credit rating agency Moody\u2019s, the latter became the first in Vietnam to successfully apply Basel II standards, in November, after two years of implementation. VIB, which was reportedly among five bidders for ANZ\u2019s retail business in Vietnam but was ultimately outbid, saw pre-tax profit in 2017 double from that of 2016 to VND1.4 trillion ($62 million), while OCB, despite not having released its full-year 2017 results at the time of writing, is expected to exceed the milestone of VND1 trillion ($44 million) in pre-tax profits after reaching $42.2 million in the first eleven months, according to CEO Mr. Nguyen Dinh Tung.\nWhile divestments by foreign investors may have a critical impact on the capital adequacy of Vietnamese banks, the loss of expertise is also a blow for the sector in implement much-needed governance improvements. While local banks have answers for both issues they may just be quick fixes before they seek new foreign partners willing to work with them for the next decade.\nAfter immediately reducing its foreign ownership to zero after buying back the 19.41 per cent held by HSBC, Techcombank is now asking for shareholder approval to sell as much as 158.4 million shares to foreign investors this year. The bank, which targets 2018 pre-tax profit of VND10 trillion ($440 million) and plans to list on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE) this year, has joined ACB in recruiting more foreigners to key positions to tackle the governance puzzle and is looking to domestic shareholders to resolve its recapitalization issue, with it successfully collecting more than VND2.1 trillion ($92.4 million) after issuing 70 million shares to existing shareholders in October.\nACB\u2019s foreign ownership has been at the limit for many years and there is no immediate reason this will change given the nature of its latest transaction. The Standard Chartered deal, estimated at $263 million, involves the sale of 154 million shares, or 15 per cent, and saw Standard Chartered APR sell its 8.75 per cent stake to Estes Investment and Sather Gate Investment, while Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) sold 6.25 per cent to Boardwalk South, Whistler Investments, and Estes Investment. An analyst at the Ho Chi Minh Securities Corp. (HSC) told VET that the divestment price may have been determined some time ago and the recent announcement was most likely the result of a long-term negotiation process.\nRegional powerhouses emerging in Vietnam at full speed could perhaps fill the space being emptied as international banks exit. Having established a representative office in Vietnam in 2014, South Korea\u2019s Daegu Bank signed a comprehensive cooperation agreement last July with OCB to facilitate the local lender\u2019s business in international payments and services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). And while information regarding the buyer of the BNP deal is yet to be released, the question now is which single foreign bank or investor will come to the country next after OCB locked its foreign ownership at 23.66 per cent in late December.",

    "text": "From time to time it's pertinent when discussing punting to go over the key factors which usually determine which horses will win and be placed. Too many punters forget these 'basics' of racehorse betting.\nSummed up, we can list them. as: Class, Consistency, Fitness. But added to these are a host of other variables that you must also take into account along with class, consistency and fitness. These are the key factors.\nFor instance, you must look at how long since a horse had its last start. Track experience has it that 'hot' gallopers will be racing again wit' iin a week. The thinking here is that if you have a horse in top fitness, and which is racing well, you don't keep him at home in the stable you race him!\nStatistics show that few horses win which haven't started within the previous 28 days. There are exceptions, of course, because some horses do race well fresh from a spell, and some-like Kate's Myth-can come back and win after a break of 18 months!\nAlways take into careful consideration whether a horse has had recent racing. Be biased in favour of those which had their last start within the previous 14 days.\nThen there's the key factor of distance suitability. A horse may have class, consistency and fitness on its side but if it is placed over an unsuitable distance it is unlikely to win. Most horses are bred for certain distances and only a few can mix sprints and staying races successfully. Check on a horse's past performances to see if it suited by the distance of the race it is tackling.\nNext factor is weight-probably one of the most important factors, because weight is a lynchpin of handicap racing. The more weight a horse has to carry the harder its task; it's as simple as that. Weight can beat any horse, no matter what its class or ability.\nAs horses win, or perform well, they are given more weight. Be very wary of any horse which is asked to carry 2.5kgs or more on the weight it carried at its last start--except when it is dropping substantially in class.\nBarrier draw is also to be taken into consideration. At most tracks, a wide draw can severely affect any horse's winning chance. Take a field of 18, say, at Randwick over the 1000m and you'll always see that those drawn outside do it tough. The same thinking applies to other tracks and other distances.\nThen there are key factors like jockeys, trainers, a horse's price, and whether or not it is likely to be suited by the actual pace of the race. It's a good idea to have a key factor chart in front of you when you assess any race.\nIs the horse racing in form, or closely approaching his best form?\nIs the horse reasonably well weighted?\nCan the horse handle the track?\nAre the track conditions suitable?\nIs the horse drawn well at the barrier?\nIs the horse in the hands of a successful trainer?\nIs the horse racing in its correct Class?\nAs well as the key factors concerning the horses themselves, there is the further issue of choosing the right races on which to bet. Are you going to bet on them all, or just a couple, a half dozen, or maybe just three or four? Some races are difficult to analyse because of poor quality, too much quality, or simply lack of form (early 2yo. races, for example).\nFinally, there's the matter of exactly how you go about selecting a horse to win a race. Quite often, it's a most useful exercise to find all the horses which cannot win! Get them out of the way first and then concentrate on the rest of the field.\nYou do this by looking firstly at all horses listed from 20/1 out to 100/1, or whatever is the longest price quoted for the race. You can usually eliminate about one third of the runners, which then n-takes your task far easier to find the main chances.\nA field of 15 can usually be cut down to just 10 runners and this is where you can rigidly apply the key factors we have already discussed in this article. Look for horses running at unsuitable distances, horses with big weight rises, horses drawn badly, horses which don't seem to like the track, or the going, horses to be ridden by ordinary jockeys and those from stables which rarely win.\nThis second procedure should eliminate five of the 10 remaining runners, leaving you with the prime list of winning candidates. You then have the choice of which one to bet, or which ones to bet on, or you can leave the race alone if you feel it's just too hard, and that there isn't much value in it because of the tightness of the prices.\nSuccessful punters are rarely found betting on every race. Remember that when you are rushing around like mad at a race meeting, betting here, there and everywhere!",

I am sure you would get plenty of support for concerts and would have the opportunity to also see our beautiful country. You would be warmly received by us all.\nPlease remember Australia when you are planning future tours.\nNeither do most of us, but we understand them with our hearts.\nBetter then the english ones.\nWhat a problem ! Dutch biggest Ruslana fan is now living in your country too. Try to find a solution : Irish fanclub ?\nI love Irish music and I am not the only one here.\n...So there is a Dutch fanliving in Ireland too!! Hummm! That means there is at least 2 Ruslana fans in Ireland !!!\nLads this is the messages for Ruslana topic!!\nAnd I am not a lad either :-) But you may say lad to me - as the only one ok ?\nSorry! ...

KLASNI!!!\nhahaha, you really express yourself wonderful sometimes!!\nLOL! LADS!!

Part 1 aired May 23, 2006. Paul Moyer reports: Is the government manipulating the weather?\nToxic Sky, Part 2. November 2006. In a Channel 4 exclusive, Paul Moyer uncovers new information about unusual cloud formations over the Southland.\nPetroleum Project Management, What Makes it a Worthwhile Occupation?\nWhen an employee with the right credentials is assigned the role of project management, regardless of what product they are producing or manufacturing in that particular business, the role of project manager mostly involves the process planning, monitoring, organizing, and motivating the people that are supposed to work under your leadership. The role of product management is not an easy one as there are specific goals that needs to be reached, or target production volume that needs to be finished. An ideal project manager is someone who can persuade his group to be enthusiastic about work.\nProject management can easily be said as an early stage or preparation in being a leader who leads the people that work for him. This is why it is essential for any project manager to possess leadership skills as this will play a very important part in achieving success in any type of work or task assigned to them. The leadership quality should be inherent to the person and this will be the one that will help them in persuading others in working together for a common goal.\nProduction businesses and facilities are not always on the large scale that occupies large business areas and floor rooms in commercial building structures. In addition to this, there are many different type of production work that requires the watchful monitoring capability of a supervisor team leader. Since even similar product types will have a different approach over a certain task, job, or arrangement, putting emphasis on the result that matters with the project is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important. In Oil and Gas Project Management, certain teams may be assigned to create better enhancements so that time does not easily pass without doing anything that is relevant.\nThese days, the oil and gas industry faces daunting challenges as there are many technological enhancements and refinements that may have been created they need to know and understand. The problem mostly is if they are not located similarly under one roof. When it comes to managing oil and gas projects, both budget and timeline are very crucial. If a project manager is given free reign, as long as he has leadership skills and he is able to convince his team to work coherently together towards a same goal, even the challenges of large projects will be doable under this situation.\nPetroleum project management is now a course that you can take to prepare you towards the possibility of being awarded this position. Knowing and understanding the job description much early on prior to even taking the job will most likely create a successful petroleum operator and manager in you. As long as you have leadership, people skills, and overall knowledge in petroleum, project management principles, and in what is needed to be done, then you will most likely be able to achieve success in almost any task or project your employer may assign to you. Through oil and gas project management courses provided by select schools, you will be able to get a grasp as to what this profession is all about and how you can possibly make things better for yourself should you decide to take it.\nAir Apparent takes a look at the proposed radical \"escape route\" contingency plan from Nobel Prize winning scientist Paul Crutzen. His solution? Dumping sulphur directly into the stratosphere. Read.\nChemtrails, contrails, distrails ... what's going on in our skies?\nGovernments, environmental and news agencies meet queries and reports with silence, buck-passing, and/or stock replies. Legitimate petitions to government have proved fruitless. The mainstream media is noticeably absent. As a result, speculation as to the nature of these effluent events is rampant.\nIt is the goal of Toronto's Air Apparent to raise public awareness and garner enough media attention, in order to exert significant pressure on the \"powers that be\" to evoke an honest response. It would seem however, that honesty and power is a prickly combination and, rather like clear blues skies, in short supply these days.\nGood news! Canadian Action Party condemns chemtrails!\nAnd this: Chemtrails \u2013 coming out of the closet?\nThe Las Vegas Tribune published a 2-part series on chemtrails last August 2005. Read the September 9th '05 follow up.\nOne of our gallery photos was used to illustrate this licensed pilot's request for an explanation from the Canadian Federal agency, Environment Canada as to the nature of the \"spraying in the sky\". The response is in stark contrast to the official party line!\n\"Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves. So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations. It's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our efforts, and that's why this is so important.\" -- Then U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen. April 1997 counterterrorism conference sponsored by Senator Sam Nunn.",

The RAZR MAXX will be almost identical to the current RAZR, except for a massive boost in battery capacity. The original handset has a 1700mAh battery, while the RAZR MAXX will feature a whopping 3300mAh battery, which Verizon\u2019s claims will offer 21 hours of continuous talk time.\nThe smartphone will be aimed at heavy multitaskers and at just 8.99mm thick, the RAZR MAXX will not be much larger than the already almost impossibly thin RAZR.\nAlthough no release date was mentioned, Verizon did boast that the RAZR MAXX will ship with 32GB of total memory and will retail for $300 with a new two-year customer agreement.\nWith failing batteries being the biggest complaint among smartphone users, especially iPhone 4S owners, the Droid RAZR MAXX could prove wildly successful if it stands up to its expectations. Be sure to check back for more on this handset, as well as other smartphones that were announced at CES 2012.",

    "text": "1. What is Nicholls\u2019 school code?\nNicholls\u2019 school code is 002005.\n2. If I have a parent who is enrolled in a college or university, can this parent be counted as a family member in college when calculating my financial aid?\nUnder normal situations a parent cannot be included as part of the \u201cnumber of family members in college\u201d. However, certain circumstances may warrant the inclusion; contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information.\n3. My parents have a lot of debts. Where are expenses reported on the FAFSA?\nThere is no specific section that you list expenses. The formula used by the Federal processor to calculate the Expected Family Contribution assumes that a certain amount of income is needed to support a family. Also, it is based on the household size and the number of family members in college. The Federal financial aid methodology does not make allowances for different lifestyle choices, which often influence the amount of a family\u2019s living expenses.\n4. I\u2019m going to be married during the school year for which I am applying for aid. Can I fill out my FAFSA as \u201cmarried\u201d?\nNo. You must indicate your marital status as of the date you are completing the FAFSA. In general, once you have indicated your marital status, it is not changed. However, certain situations may warrant an update.\n5. My parents are separated or divorced. Whose information should be given on the FAFSA?\nOn the application, information should be given for the parent you lived with the most in the last 12 months. If you don\u2019t live with either parent or lived with both parents for an equal number of days, information should be given for the parent who provided the greater amount of support to you during the last calendar year. FAFSA instructions have information that will be helpful if you have questions about providing information from separated or divorced parents.\nIf the parent that you reported has remarried, you must also include information about your stepparent on the FAFSA. Your stepparent must be included, regardless of the marriage date or the stepparent\u2019s intent to provide financial support for you. If you receive financial support from the parent not reported also, you should report this as an Other Untaxed Income amount on the FAFSA.\n6. My custodial parent remarried and signed a prenuptial agreement that absolves the step-parent from financial responsibility for my education. Why does my step-parent have to provide financial information on the FAFSA?\nPrenuptial agreements are ignored by the federal need analysis process. After all, two individuals (parent and step-parent) cannot make an agreement between them that is binding on the third party (the federal government). The federal government considers the step-parent a source of support regardless of any prenuptial agreements to the contrary. If a step-parent marries the parent, he or she is considered responsible for supporting the parent and children even if he or she is unwilling to do so.\n7. What does it take to be considered an independent student?\nIn determining whether you are independent, our office is required to adhere to the standard definition of independent status as outlined by the United States Department of Education. To be considered an independent student for financial aid consideration, you must be able to answer \u201cyes\u201d to at least one of the thirteen questions in Step Three of the FAFSA. If you cannot answer \u201cyes\u201d to at least one of the questions below, you are considered a dependent student and should include parental information on the FAFSA.\nWere you born before January 1, 1989?\nAt the beginning of the 2012-13 school year will you be working on a master\u2019s or doctorate program?\nDo you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you between July 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013?\nDo you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you, now through June 30, 2013?\nAt any time since you turned 13, were both your parents deceased, were you in foster care or were you a dependent or ward of the court?\nAt any time on or after July 1, 2011, did your high school or school district homeless liaison determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?\nAt any time on or after July 1, 2011, did the director of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Dept of Housing and Urban Development determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless?\nAt any time on or after July 1, 2011, did the director of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless or were self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?\n8. My parents don\u2019t want to fill out the FAFSA. Can I use only my information?\nIf none of the dependency status questions on the FAFSA apply to you, the parental information is required because you are classified as a dependent student for financial aid purposes. However, under limited circumstances you may be able to submit your FAFSA without parental information. If you are unable to provide parental information, skip steps 4 and 5. Once you have submitted your FAFSA without parental data, you must follow up with the financial aid office in order to complete your FAFSA.\n9. My parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return and don\u2019t give me any money. Can I file as \u201cIndependent\u201d?\n10. I am really independent, why do I have to apply for financial aid using my parent\u2019s income and asset information?\n11. I\u2019m moving out of my parents\u2019 house and will support myself from now on. Do my parents still have to fill out the FAFSA?\n12. What happens if my parents decide they will not provide any financial assistance (Expected Family Contribution) towards my college expenses?\nThe federal student aid programs are based on the premise that students (and their parents, or spouse, if applicable) have the primary responsibility of paying for their college education. You are encouraged to seek scholarships. You can also seek employment. Additionally, you may want to consider a student loan. If mitigating circumstances apply, contact our office.\n13. What if my, or my parent\u2019s, income has changed significantly since I completed my FAFSA?\nIf you or someone in your household has experienced a loss or change of income since you completed the FAFSA, please contact our office for more information on special circumstances. Specific information will be needed from those in the household affected.",

If you know our family, you know that hubs loves to buy 50 pound bags of potatoes, you win the prize if you can tell me how many potato pancakes that would make!!\nHere is the recipe that he likes the best! For perfect results!\nPeel and grate potatoes, we use a cuisinart grater, Drain off any excess liquid with paper towels.\nMix in egg, cream, salt, and black pepper. Add enough flour to make mixture thick.\nHeat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Drop two or three 1/4 cup mounds into hot oil, and flatten to make 1/2 inch thick pancakes. Fry, turning once, until golden brown. Transfer to paper towel lined plates to drain, and keep warm in low oven until serving time. Repeat until all potato mixture is used.",

    "text": "If we are to manage for any wildlife species it is imperative that the necessary habitat requirements for their survival be provided. An example is the Kirtland\u2019s Warbler, an avian specie that was on the brink of extinction. They require a certain age class of jackpine, in a specific density, with an acreage requirement per bird.\nKey Wild Turkey habitat ingredients as specified by the DNR are trees, shrubs and grass in close proximity to each other.\nGrassy openings supply an abundance of insects, seeds and other foods for adults and especially for poults.\nWhen the turkey fund was established there was a commitment to the turkey hunters that if they would buy a special license it would be used to manage Wild Turkeys throughout the state. If Wild Turkeys are to be managed as the law requires then the DNR is required to establish and manage the critical key habitat requirements of the Wild Turkey throughout the entire state.\nAs far back as over a quarter century ago we discovered the huge blocks of mast producing hardwoods on our state forests were absent of Wild Turkeys. One of the key habitat ingredients of managed, grassy wildlife openings were non existent. As we inquired from field biologists why wildlife openings were not being created a common answer was given that there was no money. No money? That is exactly what the turkey fund was established for. So where was and is the money going? This began several decades of being stone walled in an attempt to find out.\nFinally in 2005 we were able to get a peek at the 2002 turkey fund expenditures as the Natural Resources Commission was reviewing all of the restricted funds, then the door closed again. Since the establishment of the turkey fund in 1977 millions of dollars have been spent on 400,000 acres of state game areas in southern Michigan and virtually nothing has gone to the 3.9 million acres of state forests.\nDuring the 2002 period $2,533,071 was spent. Expenditures went for parking lots and gates, herbaceous planting, opening maintenance. $429,981 was spent on stream bank stabilization on private property and $872,144 spent on turkey habitat acquisition, all in southern Michigan. We monitor all of the Natural Resources Commission meetings and never was the Turkey Fund listed as providing funds for land purchases.\nThe Turkey Fund did indeed fund these land purchases but under another name. It took some time to get the criteria of these purchases and not one mentioned Wild Turkey. River, stream and lake frontage was included as the purchase of 15 acres including a 2 story house, 3 car garage and barn for $250,000, which later had to be torn down probably using the Turkey Fund. Obviously, under the guise of turkey management the DNR has used our license dollars as a slush fund with virtually nothing being returned to our state forests.\nOn advising private landowners how to manage their land for Wild Turkey the DNR advises that 5 percent should be in managed grassy openings. This should be true for our hardwood state forest lands. In partnership with the Michigan Conservation Foundation the MWTHA examined a comparison of managed grassy openings in various state forest management units inventories for treatment in 2006. It doesn\u2019t make much difference if it is 2006, 1996 or 2010 it is the same situation.\nIt must be remembered that forest openings are critical habitat for a great number of wildlife species, from deer to insects. So is DNR management providing these? As an example of the forest compartment inventories, Pigeon River Country 12,114 acres with 20 openings totaling 121 acres, Gladwin 20,218 acres with 2 managed openings totaling 19 acres, Cadillac 24,336 acres with 2 managed openings toting 24 acres, Roscommon 24,001 acres with 10 managed openings totaling 119 acres, etc.\nFor the first time the DNR Wildlife Division submitted to the public the Turkey Fund expenditures for 2010. A total of $1,693,000 is appropriated. $1,453,045 is allocated to 400,000 acres of state game areas, while $239,955 is allocated to 3.9 million acres of state forests through out northern Michigan. Very little is actually going to reach the ground of our state forests.\nSeveral years ago the U.S. Forest Service contracted with Michigan State University to conduct a study of the recreational use of the Huron-Manistee National Forest. The number one use was found to be hunting. During their planning of the 2006 Huron-Manistee plan the USFS stated that 35 percent of licensed hunters in Michigan hunted on national forest lands. Michigan State University acknowledged the same is true for out state forests. It would seem logical that the DNR would be obligated to manage these 3.9 million acres for game birds and animals, however this is not the case.\nMinimum habitat is not being provided and deer, grouse, woodcock, rabbit, hare and turkey. Their numbers are suppressed on our state forests. As recently as 1992 Michigan had 1,171,721 hunters. In 2008 there were 790,789. We have lost 380,932 hunters during that time. We have lost a third of our hunters during that time period.\nSouthern Michigan is one huge tract of Wild Turkey habitat with its agriculture and wood lots, controlled by private land owners. Development and sprawl is eating wildlife habitat. Unless one can afford to lease hunting land or has a relative who does, access is very difficult. The future of hunting in Michigan is dependent on our public forests. The lack of game on our state forests is reflected in the alarming loss of our hunters.\nOver the years we have met with a series of DNR Wildlife Division chiefs, staff, with DNR Directors and have testified many times before the Natural Resources Commission only to fall on deaf ears. It appears that the only recourse we have is to seek legislation that will mandate the distribution and use of the fund. What a shame!",

Simple blend of spices. And we listen to our customers as we are here for them.\"\n2. Favorite food when you're at home? \"Simple things like fried egg on toast and lamb biriyani\"\n3. Least favorite food? \"Not a big fan of raw fish on rice\"\n4. Food that makes you swoon? \"Cheesecake\"\n5. Food that takes you back to your childhood? \"My mums cooking of course, but she rarely cooks now, owning 4 restaurants\"\n6. Any food that you are horrible at making? \"No. Try, try, and try again and when that fails, try again.\"\n7. Why did you get into the restaurant business? \"My mums had tried to get me to America for 20 years and I told her and my brother 8 years ago [that I would] only if we could open an Indian restaurant . So we opened Spice avenue in Santa Barbara. Because America needed a decent Indian restaurant like we have back home in England.\"\n8. Where do you get your inspiration? \"I'm inspired by everything around me. Trends change so should you.\"\n9. Favorite local restaurant? \"Charm Thai Cuisine and P6 in Westlake\"\n10. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now? \"No idea , hopefully we are looking to open a THE CURRY LEAF in Thousand Oaks next year if things go good, full bar and lounge with restaurant, more up market.\" 25 years from now? \"In good health\"",
