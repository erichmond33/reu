    "text": "UNStudio has joined forces with HPP Architects to create a consortium (UNS + HPP) to carry out the next phases of their winning project at the architectural design competition for FOUR Frankfurt. Take a look at the complete story after the jump.\nFrom the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Gro\u00df & Partner real estate development company \u2013 who will be carrying out the development of the project \u2013 back in 2015. Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years. Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt\u2019s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground. The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation.\nThe choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt\u2019s shopping district to the east of Ro\u00dfmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage. With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents.\nThe new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstra\u00dfe into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site.\nAccording to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value. The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages. The existing block on the Junghofstra\u00dfe will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels.\nFour Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023.",

The rally was also held in the last year with the same objectives. Goals of the rally are to criticize Jogye Order for its responsibility on Dongguk University\u2019s present conflicts related to President Han Tae-sik (Bogwang) and to guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy from the order.\nAt 11:00 A.M., approximately 200 people, about 150 Donggukians and 50 people who are related to Dongguk University, gathered together in Manhae Hall. As soon as the march began, the marchers were obstructed by police officers because of a cow, which was prepared by the GSC, was not reported to participate in the rally. Scuffles broke out between the police and the GSC, and the cow was not able to go with the marchers. The parade was started from Chungmu-ro where Dongguk University is located, passed Myeong-dong and finally to Jogyesa Temple.\nAfter several speeches from students, the GSC and the gathered students tried to deliver request proposal to Jogye Order together, but police officers blocked the way. Therefore, only ten representatives were allowed to go to deliver the request proposal to the persons concerned of the Jogye Order at the temple gate. The request proposal involves following three demands: Jogye Order has to stop intervening in the school matters and should guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy, every sunim who spoiled the school needs to apologize and resign, and board of directors should be reformed in a more democratic way.",

The client wants its clients to be able to not only sign up online but also in store, the problem is my client will not accept the 0.01p charge on the checkout with a 100% discount code, this is because they feel there customers will not like having to pay online.\nI know you suggest 2 options on the plugin: 1 being a free registration form but this is open to abuse if the link gets leaked and will also require a lot of moderation on the admin side of things to make sure each sign up actually did join in store. 2 being a free trial, we can set the trial up to last a year but then the checkout will still require a form of payment to start running once the trial period has ended.\nIs there any solution to this problem? we need it to be as secure as it can without being open to abuse and easy to administrate.\nWhat is the best solution for this?\nLet us know if that answers your question.",

This fauna comprises giants akin to the ca. 12 m lengthy caiman Purussaurus, but additionally a diversified fish fauna and fragile molluscs, while fossil pollen and spores shape relics of ancestral swamps and rainforests.\nWith exceptional wit, readability, and intelligence, Richard Dawkins, one of many world&apos;s most famed evolutionary biologists, has brought numerous readers to the wonders of technological know-how in works equivalent to The egocentric Gene. Now, within the Ancestor&apos;s story, Dawkins deals a masterwork: an exciting opposite journey via evolution, from present-day people again to the microbial beginnings of lifestyles 4 billion years in the past.\nColonial dwelling is characterised through department of work and finely coordinated association; besides the fact that, many occasions inside of a colony are the results of conflicts among participants trying to maximize their very own pursuits. This interaction of cooperation and clash has raised many questions in evolutionary biology, in particular how cooperative habit is maintained within the absence of direct replica through staff.\nTo this point, the dominant paradigms by which glossy scientists have seen nature were established essentially round Newtonian and Darwinian methods. As theoretical ecologist Robert E. Ulanowicz observes in his new paintings, a 3rd Window, neither of those types is enough for explaining how actual change\u2014in the shape of inventive increase or emergence\u2014takes position in nature.\nEcology is in a hard kingdom as a systematic self-discipline. whereas a few theoretical ecologists try to construct a definition of ecology from first rules, many others are wondering even the feasibility of a normal and common thought. even as, it really is more and more vital that ecology is safely and functionally outlined for a iteration of researchers tackling escalating environmental difficulties within the face of doubt and war of words.\nSee Chapter 15). , Chapter 16.

Riff and J. van Arkel. et al. argue that in the past 30 Ma well-documented episodes of marine influence in Amazonia are limited to the Miocene. However, there is no evidence for fully established marine corridors (\u2018seaways\u2019) throughout the South American continent in the Cenozoic. ). Megafans are low-gradient river systems choked by sediments, which force them to continuously change their courses.\n2004): 11 30 20 10 0 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 Age (Ma) 3500 Fig. 2 Histograms for U-Pb ages for 369 grains of detrital zircon collected from the mouth of the Amazon River outlet show peaks in the Archean, Trans-Amazonian and Grenvillian intervals.

Or, in other words, have you ever experienced a length contraction because of the movement of another coordinate system?\nIf it isn't possible to have any length contractions according to relativity, how can relativity then explain the relativistic experiments where a Lorentz contraction occurs?\nIn the quantum field theory, the Casimir effect is a physical force arising from the zero-point field, where the zero-point field is the quantum state with the lowest possible energy.\nThe existence of the zero-point field, at the same time both confirms the theory about the structure and composition of the Cosmos, and overturns Einstein's principle of relativity.\nThis can bee seen from the fact, that you cannot - as Einstein postulate - have that \"the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good\" and at the same time have a stationary zero-point field.\nFor instance will the velocity relative to the zero-point field be different for different frames of reference.",

But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.",

    "text": "Here are your morning links!\nJanczak looked solid in his second start since returning from injury.\nTCU broke through in the sixth inning with a pair of run. Jake Guenther and Alex Isola singled to open the inning. A wild pitch had both runners in scoring position and Johnny Rizer delivered a two-run single up the middle to make it a 6-2 ballgame. The Frogs didn\u2019t go quietly, scoring a run on a Zach Humphreys groundout in the eighth. With two outs in the ninth, the Frogs put the tying run on base with walks to Josh Watson and Isola around a Guenther base hit. UTA closer Andrew Gross wiggled off the hook with a ground out to end the game. Jared Janczak (0-2) tossed 4 1/3 innings. He allowed six runs (two earned) on six hits, walked one and struck out two. Haylen Green and Matt Rudis allowed one combined runner over the last 3 2/3 innings of the game. The pair fanned seven.\nThe defensive end position is loaded, name-wise, but not very experienced.\nThis is a spot with a ton of turnover and, in turn, opportunities for new faces. Mathis, who some have compared to Jerry Hughes when it comes to potential, appears to be on his way to a starting role after continuing to earn rave reviews through spring. Patterson hinted that 2019 could finally be Bowen\u2019s time too, so don\u2019t take your eyes off the 6-foot-4 Byron Nelson High School product when fall camp arrives down the stretch.\nThe cornerback would fill a massive need with Jeff Gladney and Julius Lewis set to graduate.\nJenkins is getting recruited by Jeremy Modkins mostly because he\u2019s the cornerbacks coach for the Frogs. However, Jenkins says he\u2019s built a strong relationship with each of the coaches on staff.\nJenkins was hosted on his visit by redshirt freshman Atanza Vongor. The four-star says he got along with the defensive back as well as the rest of the team.\nEquestrian has put together a solid season.\nTCU News: Joe Broadnax\u2019s career is over, will Justin Rogers play this year?",

    "text": "Grace. What is it? What does it mean? How do you get it and how do you KNOW you got it?\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I have no way of describing something I don\u2019t understand BUT believe deeply in my soul that it exists. How do you get these graces? Sanctifying grace is IN your soul. It\u2019s the free and underserved gift from God. Actual grace would come from our knowledge and belief of all things right and wrong \u2013 following the Ten Commandments, making sure we follow a path that is pure and justified. Justified means to be sinless, and to be sinless means you are in favor with God. When you are baptized you are sinless and therefore have favor with God. When you go to reconciliation, you are once again sinless and in favor with God. You are in a state of grace. Once sanctifying grace is in your soul, you can increase it by every good action you do \u2013 receiving Communion, saying prayers, performing corporal works of Mercy. The most important thing to think about is NOT what you are going to do or how you are going to do it but to recognize God\u2019s love. The reason you can do any good work is because God LOVES YOU FIRST in Grace. You must continually seek God\u2019s grace, continually respond to the actual graces God is working within you, inclining you to turn to Him and do good.\nHave I answered the question as to what Grace is? I\u2019ve read through all the study guides provided to me and compiled all the information, but I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve properly explained what Grace is.\nTo me Grace is a feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s butterflies in the stomach, and it takes my breath away. I feel this way every time I think of my husband. We met and married 38 years ago. I see God\u2019s grace in our meeting, getting married, and living our life together as husband and wife. Sometimes it\u2019s a jolt, like an electric shock and then an overwhelming wave of love, like the enormous amount of love I felt when I held my first baby in my arms for the first time. This happened again with my 2nd and 3rd child, and then God blessed us with twins to make 4 and 5. Then sometimes it feels like a raging fight going on inside me, making hard decisions that breaks my heart in two. I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray. Mostly it\u2019s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me \u201cGrandma\u201d. I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.\nWhere does Grace come from?",

    "text": "Everyone seems to want a brighter smile, and teeth whitening is a great option for boosting your confidence. If food and drinks have stained your pearly whites, you may be tempted to rush to the drug store and pick up the first over-the-counter whitening product you find. However, while side effects from whitening products are rare, you should follow these tips before bleaching your teeth to ensure your safety.\nIf your teeth appear stained, don\u2019t assume you need to bleach them. It\u2019s possible a good teeth cleaning will restore the sparkle to your smile. During an oral exam, your dentist will also check for cavities and gum issues, which should be treated before bleaching your teeth.\nAt-home whiteners most often use carbamide peroxide in concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent. Carbamide peroxide is hydrogen peroxide with urea added. This product remains active for up to 10 hours at a low enough acidity level that enamel etching is not a concern.\nStart with a product containing 10 percent carbamide peroxide. If the whitener doesn\u2019t bother your mouth, but you don\u2019t see the results you want, try another over-the-counter product with a higher concentration.\nWhen you choose an at-home teeth bleaching kit, it\u2019s your responsibility to follow the instructions on the package. Don\u2019t leave the gel or strips on your teeth longer than advised or you could experience tooth sensitivity and sore gums. Also, avoid drinking soda, sports drinks or other sugary/acidic beverages for several hours after whitening to prevent etching your teeth.\nAt-home whitening kits are inexpensive and widely available, but that doesn\u2019t make them the best choice. Professional in-office teeth bleaching can lighten your smile up to eight shades in a single 45-minute visit. Combined with professional-grade take-home treatments, patients see an average improvement of 11 shades. In comparison, over-the-counter whitening requires daily 30-minute applications for more than two weeks to achieve a six-shade improvement.\nIn-office whitening uses LED light-activated technology to maximize results in the shortest amount of time without causing tooth sensitivity. It\u2019s effective both for people who simply want to lighten their smile and for patients with severely discolored teeth.\nPregnant women and nursing mothers should postpone teeth bleaching.\nTranslucent teeth don\u2019t respond well to whitening. A tooth-colored composite placed on the lingual side of a see-through tooth is a more effective way to improve its appearance.\nZen Dental Center in Seattle offers Philips Zoom in-office teeth bleaching for safe, professional results.

    "text": "Constant development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) technologies results in evolving aircraft, instrumentation, and control programs of these systems. An open source simulator was examined as a potential method of testing UAS platforms changes. The open source simulator was used to simulate flights flown by an actual platform. Existing flight data was used as a base line of comparison for the telemetry data of the simulated flight. Patterns in parameters such as vehicle attitude and throttle output were compared between the simulated and actual results to determine if the simulator produced an accurate representation of a physical flight. Analysis of the simulated vehicle exhibited similar behavior to that of the actual vehicle in most of the flight data collected. Simplification in the flight simulator model may be responsible for the deviations in magnitude observed between the two sets of data. Three points of interest in each of the three test cases were chosen as checks for the values in the data. These points in the flight were studied in the various graphs of the parameters graphed and the difference between the simulated and actual values was calculated. The values at these points stayed within an average of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for vehicle attitude and between 0% and 33.3% throttle difference over the three test cases. The average difference in attitude was 5.1\u00b0 over 93 compared values and 8.1% in throttle over 18 compared values. On average the simulator showed good agreement to existing flight data and therefore will be a good tool to simulate flights prior to a mission. The accuracy of the results may be improved with further development of the simulation model.\nRamirez Duarte, Jaime A.

The exhibition showed us the way to do business right and to do it effectively and efficiently. The exhibition also made room for us to meet various investors, who have tremendously been of help to the growth of Hyst Global Business Ltd.\nI exhibited at the African Food and Products Exhibition 2018. The Event was a wonderful one and an eye-opener for not just me but for other exhibitors and attendees. From the conference sessions, I acquired knowledge on exportation of goods. The AFPE 2018 was the door opener to my exquisite Zobo Business. I thought to myself that since the Exhibition was for African Food and Products, Zobo is an African drink so I decided to make and sell for the Exhibition. Just like magic, amidst my other products, the zobo made super sales. Now I have a branded Zobo drink.\nThe AFPE 2018 was great, it was an opportunity to have a firsthand understanding of the challenges facing SMEs, helping us know what products they needed and how they can take advantage of our service offerings. The AFPE 2019 gave us a chance to partner with many of them.\nIt was an amazing experience, my business was a month old and I didn\u2019t know anyone. It was the first time I got to be in public and I appreciate the opportunity to be exposed. Coming to the exhibition boosted my sales and created awareness for me when people didn\u2019t know me. I have got contacts from the exhibition and they have formed part of my customer base.\nLagos is a commercial hub and it was important for us to share with the market.

    "text": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon.",

    "text": "Mahatma Gandhi1 once said, \u201cThe world provides enough for every man\u2019s need but not for every man\u2019s greed.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s easy to agree with proclamations of world peace and say things like, \u201cThe rich should really give to the poor and solve world hunger!\u201d However, when the giving strikes closer to home, it can be tougher than we think.\nI once had a watch that I thought was seriously cool. It was a boy\u2019s watch, but I didn\u2019t mind; it had all the dials and gadgets you could want. I visited my family and my younger brother was crazy about my watch and asked if he could have it. I told him I couldn\u2019t possibly part with such amazingness and sadly left it at that. Shortly after getting home, my treasured watch met with an accident and broke. It was then that I realized how stupid it was that I\u2019d missed the opportunity to give it to my little brother, who was so much more important to me than that watch ever could be. It might not have lasted him forever either, but at least he would have been happy for a while. And more than the watch, the meaning behind my giving him something special would have stuck with him so much longer.\nI try to remember that incident whenever I\u2019m tempted to be selfish with my things or start to prize them too highly. It\u2019s great to have nice things and groovy gadgets. (Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m fairly addicted to my phone, which contains all my appointments, mail, reminders, to-do lists, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, Google, and favorite games.) These days, the \u201cmust-have\u201d gadgets are endless\u2014from smartphones, iPads, laptops, and gaming equipment right down to 3D home TVs! If you\u2019re able to have some of these nice things and enjoy them and they help you with your work and studies, or are also a fun source of entertainment, technology can be great. But it\u2019s good to step back sometimes and imagine what it would be like if one day all those things instantly disappeared. After your initial withdrawal symptoms, you\u2019d realize that life goes on without material things. What matters most are our loved ones\u2014our friends and family members. Sometimes we can forget this truth, and that\u2019s when we tend to act selfishly.\nThe act of giving not only helps those we give to, but us as well. Luke 6:38 says, \u201cGive, and it will be given to you.\u201d2 Sometimes what you get back will be something tangible, such as the Lord supplying things you need or someone giving to you, but more often than not what you receive in return is the satisfaction that you did something good. Have you ever given someone something they really needed or wanted and watched their face light up? It\u2019s an amazing feeling!\nAn old American movie from the 1930s called The Man Who Played God is about a concert pianist who lost his hearing in a bomb explosion. He finally got through his depression when he learned how to read lips. He\u2019d watch people in Central Park (New York City), where they\u2019d talk about their problems and troubles, and he would do what he could to solve their problems anonymously. I think it would be amazing to do something like that, to know what other people need and be able to secretly give it to them.\nThere is a cute kids\u2019 song that one or two of you may have heard when you were knee high to a grasshopper, called, \u201cI\u2019d Like to Be Invisible.\u201d The singer wishes he was invisible so that he could \u201cspread love everywhere, and help in secret ways without you knowing he was there.\u201d (Yup, it even rhymed!) The truest part of the song, though, is where it concludes that you don\u2019t have to be invisible, because you can do things to make a difference all around you. You can make it a point to look for where the need is and do what you can to fill it.\nIt\u2019s a funny story but it rings true. It\u2019s easy for me to think that if I had a million dollars, I\u2019d love to give it away to help people, or to ponder all the great things I\u2019d do for my family with money like that; but when it comes to giving away a small portion of my free time to parents who could use a break from their kids, or doing a favor that costs me in the here and now, that\u2019s where the true essence of giving really kicks in.\nI know a lot of missionaries who do great works of evangelism and charity, and it\u2019s inspiring to read about the orphanages they help and the seminars they host, and all the other great projects they do. However, I have a very personal description of what makes a missionary: it\u2019s someone with a giving heart. That means not only do they do big, impressive (and usually well-advertised) works to help the poor or disadvantaged, but they\u2019re also always there to lend a helping hand whenever there is a need. They give to their own hurt; and they don\u2019t ask for or expect favors in return. They don\u2019t have a personal agenda. They just give. And you can feel their love and kindness in their actions. They\u2019re the ones you only ask for help when you really need it, because you know they\u2019ll do everything in their power to help you. In return, you want to do anything you can to help them. Their lives are examples of cheerful and selfless giving.\nI would love to be remembered as someone like that! Sure, we all have bouts of selfishness, and human nature tends to take the path of least resistance, but it\u2019s something to strive for, don\u2019t you think? Sometimes giving can be as simple as a sincere compliment, a hug, or a word of appreciation. It can also be giving your favorite gizmo to your little brother or sister when it would mean the world to them.\n3 Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883\u2013April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese artist, poet, and writer.",

    "text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.",

    "text": "The Eastern Playoff race has been decided. The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.",

    "text": "Considering last fall\u2019s wet weather and the soggy fields this spring, farmers wonder about using inoculants on soybean seed in 2010. Should you use a rhizobium inoculant? Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don\u2019t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says. This process, nitrogen fixation, is critical for producing high soybean yields. For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn\u2019t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn\u2019t recommended because it typically doesn\u2019t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems. The total number of nodules that form decreases with increasing amounts of applied N.\nToday, most fields in the Midwest have had soybeans grown on them in the crop rotation, likely increasing population density of Bradyrhizobia bacteria in the soil, notes Saeugling. Improved inoculant technology, coupled with higher commodity prices, ease of application and relatively low-cost inoculant products, have many growers reconsidering the use of inoculants.\nSince 2003, ISU agronomists have conducted trials each year to assess new inoculants on the market. Overall, the ISU studies haven\u2019t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven\u2019t been grown in the field for the past three to five years. Other situations where it\u2019s recommended to inoculate are if soil pH is below 6.0, or if a field has sandy soil, or if a field has been flooded for more than a week, creating anaerobic conditions.\nRising cost of production and volatile commodity prices are driving the need for soybean growers to improve profits. But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently. In fact, using inoculants on soybeans without an active on-farm testing program could be costing you money. But if a field hasn\u2019t produced soybeans in the past three to five years or has never produced soybeans, an inoculant is needed for nitrogen fixation to occur.",

    "text": "Far Left Van Jones Admits that Trump Can Win and Gives Major Warning to Democrats - Video - Stumpin' For Trump!\nCNN contributor and former Obama aide Van Jones put out a warning to his fellow Democrats on Friday: Donald Trump is probably going to win the White House.\nIn the Facebook video, Jones credited Trump\u2019s ability to understand and use social media and reality television as well as his appeal to black voters as reasons he will likely win the White House in November.\nJones likened Trump to Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama in the sense that they all excelled in a new medium that no other politician could easily master.\n\u201cJust like FDR changed the rules of the game because he mastered radio, he was able to take radio and just completely master that \u2014 then you had JFK and JFK was able to master television \u2014 new medium, new master, new president,\u201d Jones said.\nHe continued to detail how Trump has been able to use his celebrity to appeal to parts of the Democratic base, especially black voters.\n\u201cIf only 70 percent don\u2019t like Donald Trump, that means 30 percent are open to his argument, if he gets half of those, he\u2019s president,\u201d Jones said.\nA Public Policy Polling report released on Monday showed Jones might be correct in his opinion that Trump is winning over large segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc. The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?",

    "text": "It took three overtimes, but No. 16-ranked St. Thomas held off a hot-shooting host Augsburg team Saturday in conference men's basketball play in Minneapolis. The Toms rode freshman guard Anders Nelson's heroics to win 112-105.\nNelson scored 35 of his career-best 37-points after halftime, and added seven rebounds, seven assists and four steals. He sank 10 of 10 at the line in the final two overtimes, and made all 12 tries on the game. He twice made shots to tie the game and extend it into the next overtime.\nThe Tommies (12-1 overall, 8-0 MIAC) ran their win streak to 12 and stayed in a share of the MIAC lead with St. John's. They also helped amend an 0-3 record last season against Augsburg. Senior Connor Bair finished with 28 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks.\nCoach John Tauer's Tommies trailed by eight points in the first half, nine in the second half, and two in the first OT. They later trailed 88-83 with 49 seconds left in the second overtime before storming back to force a third OT. They even trailed 93-91 in the third OT before Connor Bair's three-point play put them ahead to stay at 94-93.\nSt. Thomas was outscored 54-27 in 3-point scoring. The biggest trey came with :02 left in regulation and the Toms ahead 63-60 when the Auggies' Matt Carik sank a tying shot from deep in the corner.\nThe Tommies' comeback was aided by sinking 29-of-33 free throws and committing just 11 turnovers in the 55-minute game.\nThey also survived another huge game by Auggie junior Booker Coplin, the MIAC's leading scorer at 25.6 ppg. Coplin had 34 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and four blocks while playing all 55 minutes.\nNelson drove the length of the floor and hit a pull-up 14-footer at the end of the first OT to tie the game. He made four free throws in the final :05 of the second OT to help erase deficits of three and two points and force a third extra session. He sank two 3-pointers and scored 12 points in the third overtime.\nSt. Thomas plays at Bethel on Wednesday night.",

Cream is poured over to finish the drink and give it that milky, delicious taste.\nOften referred to as the oldest American cocktail, the Sazerac dates back to the pre-Civil War era. It has seen its share of changes, including the substitution of anise-flavored spirits when absinthe was banned in the US in 1912. Because of that, you may see some variation in recipes, but the basics remain.\nGive a favorite childhood candy an adult twist by getting gummy worms drunk, then whipping up a tipsy worm's perfect match: a tasty, classic margarita.\nSpice up happy hour with these unusual but oh-so-tasty beer cocktails.\nThis candy-infused frozen treat puts a grown-up twist on a childhood favorite.",

From consumables and connectors to fiber enclosures and adapter plates, Leviton fiber optic components are designed for fast, easy terminations and high quality connections. Read on to learn more about Leviton fiber optics, available right here at CableOrganizer.com!\nBefore you can terminate optical fiber, you've got to get it squeaky clean. For just that reason, you'll find a wide variety of Leviton fiber optic consumables products at CableOrganizer.com. The standard Leviton Consumables Kit comes complete with alcohol pads, polyester wipes, music wire, and lapping film. The Fast-Cure Kit is made up of all the adhesive, accelerator, needles and syringes needed for terminations with Leviton's Fast-Cure connectors. We even carry Leviton's Adhesive Accelerator kit, which contains primer and hardener for use with fiber optic connector adhesives.\nLeviton Fan Out Kits are perfect for separating and protecting 250-micron fibers during fan out terminations, and make it easy to route them into 900-micron color-coded buffer tubes. Fan out kits are available in 24\" and 36\" lengths, for 6-fiber or 12-fiber configurations.\nWhether you need to terminate single-mode or multimode fiber, Leviton's FastCAM connectors allow you to make fast, precise field terminations. Using a proven and revolutionary mechanical splice technology, FastCAM connectors eliminate the need for hand polishing, specials tools, and even epoxy! After a cleaved fiber is inserted into a FastCAM connector, the installer simply releases the factory-installed wedge clip, and an instant low-loss connection is formed.\nEIA/TIA compliant FastCAM connectors are available in LC, SC or ST styles. They're perfect for any indoor premise or fiber-to-the-subscriber installation, as well as applications that require a fast data network.

    "text": "In fact, there are currently over a million international students studying in the United States. India and China are by far the two largest contributors, with 47% of all students for the 2015-2016 school year.\nThe visa application process can be confusing though, especially when English isn\u2019t your strong suit. We at TransparentCareer have laid out each type of visa used by international students, and the application process for each visa.\nF1 Visa\u2013 These are the most common type of visas, and are used for bachelor and graduate school degrees, as well as training programs in the English language. The first step is to check whether the university you\u2019re interested in is verified by the United States government \u2013 you can\u2019t get an F1 visa for non accredited universities. Take a look here to see if your school is verified. The first step is to apply to universities where you want to study. Upon acceptance, the university will provide you with a form I-20. Keep in mind \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer once you select a school. Make sure it\u2019s the right fit for you! You\u2019ll then have to go to the site of the US embassy closest to you, and pay a non refundable application fee. Find the embassy closest to you here.\nYou\u2019ll then have to prepare for an interview \u2013 the sooner you can set this up the better. The interviewer will require proof of intent to return to your country after you complete your education (such as family, home job offer) as well as a passport and the form I-20 provided by your school. The interview will also require proof of financial sufficiency to fund your education. If you need advice on how to finance your education, take a look at this guide. Depending on your school you may also have to provide test scores such as the SAT, GMAT, or GRE.\nJ1A Visa\u2013 J1A visas are for those looking to temporarily stay in the US for a work or culture exchange program, such as to be an au pair, international camp counselor, or for specific medical training. To be accepted, you have to be sponsored by a nonprofit or government organization. You can find a list of all approved organizations here. After applying and being approved by an organization, they\u2019ll provide you with a DS-2019 form to fill out. Then you have to apply for a J1A visa at your nearest US embassy. A Sevis I-901 fee must then be paid (sometimes by your sponsor), along with a Nonimmigrant Application Processing Fee of $160. You must then schedule an appointment with the embassy, giving plenty of time in case anything goes wrong. Bring along the DS-2019 form provided by your sponsor, as well as your passport, a 2\u00d72 photo, and any additional documentation that may be required depending on the nature of your program. You can find the types of documentation on the J1A government site.\nM1A Visa\u2013 This is visa for vocational training in the US. There must be a specific program/school when you apply for the visa, and you\u2019ll have certain requirements and forms you might have to fill out for the school before applying for a visa. You aren\u2019t allowed to work while studying in the US, so you must prove to the school that you have enough money to stay in the US while getting your training. If approved by the school, they\u2019ll give you a form I-20 to fill out, which you\u2019ll need next when you set up a meeting at your nearest US Embassy. You\u2019ll also have to pay an application fee, and bring your passport, a photo (with rules provided by your consulate), a DS-160 form, and a DS-157 form if you\u2019re a male between the ages of 16 and 45.\nH1B Visa- H1B work visas are for those that have completed a higher form of education and want to work in America \u2013 it\u2019s the most common way for foreign students to stay and work in the US after graduation. These visas have to be filed by your employer, so if you\u2019re hoping to stay in America after graduation you should start the job search as soon as possible. Approvals are done through a lottery system, and start to fill up quickly after the government\u2019s fiscal year starts \u2013 typically October 1. You may file up to 6 months in advance, so filing as close to April 1 as possible is ideal. There are a total of 85,000 visas issued this way each year, and the first 20,000 are reserved for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher levels of education. The remaining 65,000 are available to those with bachelor\u2019s degrees, along with those that didn\u2019t make it past the first round with a master\u2019s or higher level of education.\nA lot of controversy has stirred up around H1B visas recently after the election of Donald Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that he wants to get rid of people who got into the US unfairly. According to Forbes, the top 10 companies that sponsor H1B visas received 25,000 visas in 2014, which is nearly 30% of all issued H1B visas. Of these 10 firms, half were firms based in India, typically working with call centers. Trump and others supportive of a crackdown claim that firms are submitting multiple applications for one person in order to game the system. 236,000 applications were received last year for the 85,000 positions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there were 236,000 applicants. While we haven\u2019t seen what a Trump presidency will look like yet, stopping people from abusing the system may provide more opportunities for foreign students looking to work in the US after graduation.\nCheck out our industry career guides on Finance, Consulting, and Tech to help you decide which is the best fit for you.\nLooking to stay in the states after graduation? You\u2019ll need to get a great job first. TransparentCareer offers free data on career pathing, salary negotiation, and compensation. Sign up for free here.",

    "text": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.",

The Bulldogs had gone 24-30 overall and 8-22 in conference play in 2015 to finish last in the Western Division and post the SEC's worst overall league record.\nBulldogs coach John Cohen, who played for Mississippi State's last SEC regular-season champions, said there isn't much of a gap separating the top of the conference from the bottom.\n\"If you're an inch off in the Southeastern Conference, you're going to get punched in the mouth a lot,\" Cohen said.\nSEC Tournament play begins Tuesday in Hoover, Alabama. No. 6 seed Vanderbilt (41-15, 18-12) faces No. 11 seed Missouri (26-29, 9-21), No. 7 seed Mississippi (40-16, 18-12) meets No. 10 seed Georgia (27-29, 11-19), No. 8 seed Kentucky (32-24, 15-15) battles No. 9 seed Alabama (31-24, 15-15) and No. 5 seed LSU (39-17, 19-11) tackles No. 12 seed Tennessee (29-27, 9-21) in single-elimination games.\nTuesday's winners advance to double-elimination play beginning Wednesday along with Mississippi State, No. 2 seed South Carolina (42-13, 20-9), No. 3 seed Texas A&M (41-13, 20-10) and No. 4 seed Florida (44-11, 19-10). The tournament returns to a single-elimination format Saturday and has a championship game Sunday.\nMississippi State made its dramatic rise up the standings by getting improvement from its new players and receiving a huge impact from its newcomers. Mississippi State's three top batting averages are owned by freshman Jake Mangum (.427) and junior-college transfers Nathaniel Lowe (.359) and Jack Kruger (.358). Kruger has a team-high .570 slugging percentage, Mangum leads the Bulldogs in on-base percentage (.479) and Lowe has a team-leading 47 RBIs.\n\"Those are all three new guys who have just had great first years,\" Cohen said. \"That's not common in the Southeastern Conference.\"\nCohen also led Kentucky to a regular-season title in 2006 and is the second coach to win an SEC regular-season championship at two different schools. Ron Polk led Mississippi State to four SEC regular-season championships before winning one at Georgia in 2001.\nHere are some things to watch in the SEC tournament.\nFIGHTING FOR POSITION: The top SEC teams already are assured of NCAA Tournament invitations but are trying to improve their positioning. Florida, Texas A&M, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Ole Miss, LSU and Vanderbilt all would like to be considered as regional hosts and/or national seeds.\nBUBBLE BATTLE: Alabama coach Mitch Gaspard and Kentucky's Gary Henderson acknowledge their teams are on the NCAA Tournament bubble after going .500 in conference play during the regular season. The two teams face each other Tuesday. \"You've got to win this game, you've got to get to the double-elimination part, you've probably got to beat (Mississippi State) on Wednesday and build those RPI points,\" Henderson said. Gaspard said that \"the winner of that game is going to have a whole lot more comfort after it and the loser is going to be sitting home on pins and needles for a week.\"\nDOMINANT GATORS/TIGERS: LSU has won five of the last eight SEC tournaments. Florida won last year's SEC Tournament and also earned the title in 2011.\nWHO'S SURGING: Mississippi State is on an 11-game winning streak. LSU had won 11 in a row \u2014 including two straight victories over Florida \u2014 before losing its regular-season finale to the Gators.\nWHO'S MISSING: Auburn (23-33, 8-22) and Arkansas (26-29, 7-23) had the SEC's two worst conference records and consequently didn't make the 12-team tournament field. With its losing record, Arkansas also is expected to miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2001.",

    "text": "WBS: why is it important & why it is not important?\nCan somebody post their view or opinion based on practice, why is it that WBS is not important or why is it that WBS is important in managing project?\nI appreciate all ur input.\ncreating a wbs forces you to think about how you are going to dissect your project and organize your project into meaningful groups or packages of work.\nIt is a way to group your work so that people can understand the where's the what's and the how's you will approcah the work.\nfor example if you were looking for an activity in the 2rd floor of Building B and the activities were not group by building and floor it would be very hard to find.\nAlso by using a wbs you can collapse work and summarise work more easily.\nI love a good WBS!\nSee below link to one of our newsletters.\nI started using activity codes even before WBS functionality was available. And I still use them, precisely for purposes as you mentioned - eg filtering the plastering items etc. And since I started using these things from DOS days, I also make use of the characters in activity ID to represent various things. And as you correctly mentioned, it is also possible to get those functionalities from few characters in the activity description.\nIn fact, the best way to input your coded information is in the activity id. That way, the information is \"in built\" and cannot be changed easily.\nAll these things including searching and filtering (eg for filtering for certain characters in activity id or description) work well when everybody is disciplined in naming and coding. And as long as one person is doing all these things, everything works perfectly well for him (as it does for me and you). But when you are integrating programmes from various contractors, it is not easy to excecise those rules with planners from various firms.\nWBS concept is as old as project management but its functionality appeared relatively late. Even in P3 3.1, WBS is still optional function that appears the same way as acivity codes. And some people still don\u0092t use it because 1) it is optional 2) activity codes seem to do the same job and 3) they are more used to activity codes. But even in P3 3.0, WBS code can do things which activity codes can\u0092t.\nFor example, you can have WBS activity and it does not need any links as in hammock activities. And this WBS activity can summarise all the activities which have the same WBS code. When you need a high level programme that shows bars in the same line as activity description (activity code roll up bar appears one line below), you can just filter for WBS activities and you get very good presentation. And the list goes on.\nAnd when you start using P3e, WBS is no more optional and it appears more different than activity codes and thus makes it more apparent. But activity code has more functionality in new programmes as well as you can have second level of codes within same acitity code. And these lower levels of codes work exactly the same way as WBS does. So you can have work breakdown stucture as well as ANY breakdown structure using a single code.\nBut as long as you have to use two or more actity codes (as you have to do in P3 3.1 and earlier), to make your work breakdown structure, it is far more easier to do so using the in built WBS coding. (And you can of course, still use activity codes, for other functionalities).\nI can therefore sort as activity description contains plastering and all the activities drop out. Now If I have also coded for floors and towers I can organise so the towers and floors show up so I know where I am.\nThat means I need to code in a tower and a floor with each activity, thats pretty easy cos I can copy and past this info.\nIf I am really smart when I copy and past the fragnet I can add some alpha numerics at the end of the ID ie 100 activity number from fragnet then T1 (tower 1) then F1 ie the id is know 100T1F1 this helps in that I can sort all activities in tower 1 or floor 1 or whatever so by using the ID and the description almost without touching the codes we have a pretty robust sorting catergory. In turn when you can sort in this way logic application and resource balancing becomes much easier.\nLets go back to the plastering scenario we now have all the activities, so linking floor to floor or globally copying resources is easy as is levelling them because you can see whats happening and more importantly so can everybody else.\nIn this way you can tell your subby exactly what he needs.\nI am not saying you cant do it with WBS and of course you can what I am saying is for a great deal of what we do in building and Civil Engineering WBS codeing is excessively complicated.\nI\u0092m Currently using Hierarchical code structures to help with the application of the cost accounts from our cost tool. I simply apply the codes to the activities and then group and sort with totals and balance my activity budgets.\nSo you can use code fields to give rudimentry totals for Units.\nThis process has helped me immensley as when I started with this company 9 weeks ago there wern\u0092t even any baselines in the projects and they were using units % Complete and just adding extra hours to the remainings by multiples of 10 or 50. They even expected to be able to resource level with this data.\nActivity codes look good and seems to show what you want to show only when data is organized in a particular way (eg phase, location, contractor etc). So it is very much a Layout depedent method.\nWBS works no matter how you organize your activities. And you can have WBS activity (in P3 for example) which summarises all the activities which have the same WBS code no matter where those activites are located. There is no such functionality available for activity codes.\nFurthermore when you organize activities with acitity codes, you will always end up with groups with no names. Planner would understand it but there would be many would be questining it everytime they see it.\nSo when you want work breakdown that really add up to whole project, use WBS. It is that simple. And use activity codes for other organizing and filtering purpose.\nI suppose WBS & Codes are lying on the same concept, so why bother? you\u0092re not showing codes on your schedule anyway.\nDont let anybody walk away with the idea when you have explained something \"gee I wonder what he is smoking\"\nOften in fact more often than I care to remember I dont employ planners because they cant do their job but because they cant explain what their job is.\nRemember we are planners, that makes us somebody who assists the process not somebody who actually does it, so go and assist the person doing it by understanding what he wants not what you feel you should give him.\nThe WBS structure is simply an end to a means.\nThe end is being able to provide BAC, ACWP, ETC, EAC & EV for particular portions of the project.\nThe WBS is simply the most widley used method of doing this, and as a consequence comes as a standard part (or code) of most planning/scheduling software.\nAs far as codes go - well the world is your oyster.\nAs far as how to, and what size, and by what method you chose to quantify and divide your project up, it\u0092s really up to you..... However you should document what each structre is for and what assumptions were made to arrive at the particular structure.\nCBS - Cost Breakdown Structure, ETC.\nAgain I will say it\u0092s limitless to how many you can have, but you should document what it is and how you came up with it.\nThat way when you\u0092re asked to explain a code field that you thought was a good idea at the time - Your manager doesn\u0092t walk away with the \"I don\u0092t know what that guy was on about\" thought in their head.\nthis is very simple! you use WBS or Codes to make your Project become \"Measurable\" either in a summarized form or a detailed one. But how do you put a certain unit to a summarized deliverable? Isn\u0092t it Lump Sum (LS)? and how do you define Lump Sum? are you gonna need WBS or Codes?\nWhile the Explanation is well \"dry but clear\"\nI think all would benefit more if you provided sonme clarity with examples.\nAs I have mention before WBS development can be viewed as the process of grouping all project elements into several major categories, normally referred to as Level One; each one of these categories will itself contain several subcategories, normally referred to as Level Two. Alternately, and more accurately, developing a WBS involves dividing the deliverable items until the project has been divided into manageable, discrete, and identifiable items requiring simple tasks to complete that, when combined, constitute the project deliverable.\nLogically is to keep dividing the project until the elements cannot realistically be divided anymore and may vary from organization to organization or may even vary among project managers within the same organization.\nEach level of detail contains not only organization specific, but they also are specific to the nature of the deliverables involved in each project. Similarly, the degree of detail at the lowest level of each branch must be in line with the size of the project and in conformance with the organization\u2019s operational philosophies.\nIdeally, there should be some uniformity and consistency in the WBS. To achieve this uniformity, all children of the same parent must be developed based on the same division basis.\nUsual practice of WBS are using three division levels which are \u201cDeliverables oriented (Structure or products, functional system, physical area and proof of capability)\u201d, \u201cSchedule oriented (normally referring to a task or activity and sequential/ phases)\u201d and \u201cResource oriented (disciplines, administrative units and financial accounts)\u201d.\nSo again, no matters how you do it by codes or groups fields or using the WBS field as long as you define the structure into manageable level and represent the project deliverable that will contribute to success of the project.\nMost of my work is in building construction, so maybe the fact that I like codes better is biased by my work.\nBut if sometimes you need to see activities organized by floor; sometimes by trade; other time by trade within each floor, etc. There\u2019s no way to do that except with codes.\nDo other lines of work have the same need or is it enough for you to squeeze into a rigid WBS and limit reports and analisys to that single point of view?\nwhat I believe it says is that progranmmes should be structured in such a way as to enable sorting in a logical and affective manner thus enabling the team to ascertain an accurate picture of the progress of the works and the elements that make up the works.\n\"for hard planning thinkers\"?? they don\u0092t know how to use codes?\nWBS show the heirarchy of Scope of work and deliverables.\nWBS is the standard for PMI, PMP, Planning Professional.\nIt is very clear in PMI influence or way of project management in general and planning in particular way of managing project.\nSo for hard planning thinkers, WBS is the preference.\nI think the need and importance of structure in a schedule is clear and proven. The point now is how.\nI prefer primavera codes over WBS or outlines. Codes are much more flexible and let you organize activities in different ways to analize different aspects of a schedule. WBS an outlines are rigid.\nOf course you can use both at the same time, but unless I\u00b4m forced by a client, I don\u00b4t use a WBS, but codes.\nIt\u0092s just a simple divide and conquer technique. It a way to go from general to specifics. It\u0092s like writing a book first you have the outline the going to the details and contents.In a way it helps in organizing a project and simplify the job of a planner.\nBreakdown Structure - Work, Cost, Organization..whatever it is..It is important! I think nobody is using a one liner schedule!\nJust to explain more on WBS. As I have said on the other thread (Work Breakdown Structure is a results-oriented family tree that captures all the work of a project in an organized way. It is often portrayed graphically as a hierarchical tree; however, it can also be a tabular list of \"element\" categories and tasks or the indented task list that appears in your Gantt chart schedule). Meaning it can be shown on a different approach or style as long as it became meaningful and useful to other member of project management. It defines as a level of schedule to make it more sensible and manageable. It is used to define the project objectives with sufficient detail information into more detail groups of scope or task. Some planner/ scheduler used activity codes as their WBS and others are just the first 1, 2, 3 or 4 character of their activities.\nProper schedules are using this technique according to their own methods so they can level their schedule to more manageable levels.\nOn my own view \u201cschedule without the proper work breakdown structure is going nowhere or meaningless as its does not show the sensible picture of the project\u201d.\nAny serious program must have some kind of organization so it is usable for control.\nWBS is one way, but there\u0092s also activity codes.\nThe more detail that you want to see (monitor), the more important the WBS. A formal and logical structure helps capture the project data (activity type, resourcing, costing, progress etc.) in the most appropriate \"pigeon-hole\".",

    "text": "\u201d It may seem surreal, but as work continues to decommission damaged reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant\u2013a project that involves 7,000 or so workers\u2013tours of the complex by outsiders are becoming increasingly popular.\nBy the end of last September, or four-and-a-half years since the nuclear accident triggered by the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami disaster, some 16,000 people had visited.\nInitially, visitors to the stricken facility were mainly politicians and specialists. But more recently, ordinary citizens are taking part as radiation levels have fallen at the plant site.\nNineteen university students took a tour last November. The bus they rode took them past large tanks holding contaminated water as well as a massive piece of equipment attached to a reactor building to extract nuclear fuel. Throughout the visit, workers wearing protective clothing and face masks could be seen.\nThe tour was organized by a group called AFW, which stands for Appreciate Fukushima Workers. Led by Akihiro Yoshikawa, 35, a former employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken plant, the group began escorting tours by residents living along the Pacific coast of Fukushima Prefecture from 2015. A major objective of the tours is to show residents what decommissioning involves.\n\u201cIf ordinary citizens abandon interest, the plant site will be further shut off from the rest of the world,\u201d Yoshikawa said.\nHe said that 140 or so people had participated in the seven tours organized to date.\nIwaki resident Kaori Suganami, 39, took part in a tour last June.\nBecause of the core meltdowns at the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors, high levels of radiation continue to be emitted. This makes it very difficult to approach those three reactors.\nElsewhere, though, rubble that was strewn throughout the plant grounds due to the tsunami generated by the magnitude-9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake has been removed, and radiation levels in many areas have dropped significantly. Ground surfaces have been paved and trees felled, which has also helped lower radiation levels.\nAccording to TEPCO, about 900 people visited in the first year after the nuclear accident. Since then, the annual number of visitors has continued to increase. Local residents joining the tours also grew in number. About 3,700 people visited the plant in the first half of fiscal 2015. Of that number, about 250 were from Fukushima Prefecture.\nUnlike workers at the plant site, visitors are not required to wear heavy protective gear. The basic getup is cotton gloves, disposable face masks and special footwear. Visitors are required to carry dosimeters. To reduce radiation exposure, visitors remain on the bus for large parts of the tour. Radiation exposure after an hour is in the range of 10 microsieverts, which is about 1 percent of the maximum additional radiation exposure of 1 millisievert established for the general population.\nIn April 2014, TEPCO established a visitation center at the Fukushima plant and two to three groups consisting of individuals 18 or older are allowed in daily. But not just anyone is allowed on the tours. \u201cAn overall assessment is made after considering such factors as the objective of the visit,\u201d said a TEPCO official.\nThe decommissioning work is expected to take decades.\n\u201d FUKUSHIMA\u2013Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s population has declined by 5.7 percent since 2010, its largest recorded drop and the cause of a widening gender gap in some areas, according to national census figures announced on Dec. 25.\nThe population drop is mainly due to ongoing evacuations following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to the preliminary figures released by the prefectural government.\nThe prefecture lost 39,715 men and 75,743 women, a decrease of 4 percent and 7.3 percent from 2010, respectively. The difference is thought to have been caused partly by the majority male presence in reconstruction efforts.\nThe national census figures are the first released by the prefectural government since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.\nFukushima prefecture\u2019s population as of Oct. 1 stood at 1,913,606, down 115,458, or 5.7 percent, from the last census in 2010.\nAmong the six towns and villages where the entire population has left under evacuation orders, four towns recorded zero inhabitants: Okuma and Futaba, which co-host the nuclear plant, and nearby Tomioka and Namie.\nThe village of Katsurao had 18 people who have returned to their homes after being evacuated. They are recorded as temporary residents, but the central government is working to make their resettlement permanent. Katsurao\u2019s evacuation order is scheduled to be lifted next spring.\nNaraha, where an evacuation order was lifted on Sept. 5, also experienced a massive decrease in its population, with 976 people living in the area, down 6,724 people, or 87.3 percent, from 2010. The figures illustrate the fact that few evacuees have opted to return home.\nThe town of Hirono, where a large portion of the population is involved in nuclear reactor decommissioning work, tallied a male population of 2,746, up 2.3 percent from 2010. The female population, on the other hand, was about half that figure at 1,577, down 42.3 percent.\nThe population figures are based on the number of people living in the prefecture as of Oct. 1, irrespective of whether they are registered as local citizens.\n\u201d Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant, has opened a rest area and canteen for cleanup workers, more than four years after the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\nTokyo Electric has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions at the plant.\n\u201cWe have taken various steps to cut accidents, including Tokyo Electric itself working more with contractors on the ground,\u201d Akira Ono, Fukushima plant manager, told Reuters.",

    "text": "Sign up to Lineout to stay up to date with all of the latest RUPA news / Thanks for subscribing!\nWith Rugby World Cup (\u201cRWC\u201d) underway the eyes of the world are on our sport. One of the most topical debates across all contact sports is the issue of concussion management.\nAll stakeholders will be looking forward to a RWC in which players, medical personnel and team support staff play their part in managing this important aspect of player welfare. Rugby is making significant progress in the detection and management of concussion and it will be important that other professional rugby competitions move to adopt the standards set for RWC 2015. Rugby should not see the management of concussion as a risk at RWC, but an opportunity to demonstrate how far the game has come in recent times.\nThe International Rugby Players Association (\u201cIRPA\u201d) is constantly thinking about what more can be done to further improve the games ability to manage the issues associated with concussion.\nEffective from 1st August 2015 after a successful global trial period at elite level, World Rugby has now formally introduced a temporary substitution rule. This applies to any player who is removed from the field of play to undertake a Head Injury Assessment (HIA) when it is unclear if that player has a suspected concussion.\nHaving the ability to remove a player from the action and from the cauldron of a packed stadium, to undertake a thorough clinical assessment and video review of an incident, in a private controlled environment, makes good practical sense. Previously players in this situation would often go untreated, or be checked over briefly on field using questionable methods.\nWorld Rugby and other key stakeholders are leading a real culture shift amongst professional players, coaches and medical personnel in relation to peer pressure to play. Recent statistics back this up. Research has underpinned the HIA process throughout. Prior to the temporary substitution trial, 56 per cent of players with a confirmed concussion remained on the field following their injury. Now that figure is less than 12 per cent (British Journal of Sports Medicine, 2014) and the hope is that following continued refinement of the HIA process we will see further improvement in 2015 and beyond.\nA key point lost on many but one that IRPA believes is fundamental to a conservative management approach is that a player is now removed once the attending medics confirm a diagnosis of suspected concussion. This takes the pressure off trying to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion during a high-pressured game. That does mean players will be removed who have not suffered a concussion, but better the conservative approach.\nThankfully the message is getting through and along with World Rugby\u2019s #RecogniseAndRemove campaign, the games stakeholders are realising that it is not just the player\u2019s responsibility but its coaches, referees, and team support staffs obligation to step in if they suspect a concussion has occurred.\nWhilst IRPA see this as a positive step, it is one that needs to be continually developed and filtered down to the community game where awareness and education on the subject is not yet at the same level.\nMedical specialist in concussion monitoring individual cases.\nAdditionally, IRPA is very supportive and engaged on the work that is being undertaken on the laws of the game to ensure the risks of on-field instances that result in serious injury, including concussive events, are minimised.\nThere is much conjecture on if rugby, and concussions sustained playing the game, lead to long-term cognitive health issues. From a player\u2019s perspective IRPA does not want that debate to be a distraction from making sure the right thing is done by the players now. IRPA believes that the game should be doing all it can to ensure the welfare and health of the player is an ongoing priority.\nSo what of the future and in particular the debate of using new technologies to take human error out of the equation? One such advancement that may justify further research and refinement is the use of sensors to help aide team doctors with real-time data. It could provide insight into accelerations and forces that they may not have seen first-hand particularly where the player has either not recognised a head knock, chosen not to seek medical assistance or suffered signs and symptoms post game. The sensor does not diagnose a concussion but rather provides accurate previously unavailable live information which combined with testing (HIA) and baseline data can aid in a clinical diagnosis. In the same way team support staff use other data like heart rates and GPS data, the sensor can provide data to assist medical personnel make informed decisions regarding concussion management.\nFrom a player welfare perspective, IRPA believes the pressure put on players to return to play to preserve their contracts and the rehabilitative support provided to players recovering from a concussion are areas that should be looked at further.\nEnsuring a players contractual terms and conditions are supportive during times of serious injury is fundamental. It allows the player the opportunity to fully recover without the added pressure or threat of having his or her salary or match payments stopped, or worse, the contract terminated. In this respect physical injuries are more obvious and certain, concussion in its very nature is obscure and invisible. Currently there are no set guidelines around minimum standards for players\u2019 contractual terms and conditions. IRPA feels that the time is right to address this, not just because of the issues around concussion, but to maintain the integrity and reputation of the game.\nFor those players who endure concussion complications either as part of their return to play process, or following a decision to stop playing, there seems little available to aide recovery beyond rest and time \u2013 which for an active professional athlete can be a very uncertain and sometimes depressing experience. IRPA would support more research into identifying rehabilitation techniques and programs to help in the resilience building and recovery process, and to ensure they are readily understood and available throughout the game.\nWorld leading player welfare standards are a priority in building the legacy of our sport. It is fundamental to the integrity of the game and to those who participate in it. IRPA is looking forward to continuing to work with World Rugby to bring about the culture change and to enhance the education and regulatory framework that ensures rugby leads the way on concussion management globally.\nThe Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) will continue to take a proactive and collaborative approach to concussion prevention and management in Australia sport, as part of its involvement with the Australian Athletes' Alliance (AAA).\nEvery week, RUPA collates five of the best features from the week\u2019s Rugby media and bring them to you in the one convenient location.\nCharlie Fetoai: Jack of all trades; master of plenty!\nFormer Reds centre Charlie Fetoai was seriously injured in 2009 and told he could never play Rugby again. He spoke to RUPA about what he's been up to since, and the importance of planning for life after Rugby.",

The Anubias Coffeefolia will have 5 or more leaves.\nAnubias barteri var. coffeefolia is a low cultivar of Anubias barteri. Its characteristic is that the leaves arch considerably between the leaf ribs, and the new leaves are red-brown. The color combination and leaf shape make it an attractive variety in both large and small aquariums. It flowers frequently under water but does not produce seeds.\nAnubias barteri var. coffeefolia is not eaten by herbivorous fish.\nI have a few of these available so you are not buying the exact piece shown in the picture but all the pieces will look just as good if not better than the one pictured.",

People are starting to choose their side. It looks like most people are against to this statement.\nNemiroff posted 4 arguments to the agreers part.\nNemiroff, historybuff and 3 visitors agree.\nYiyi, chasediedrich1, NPW, DrMrDaniel, chemikilsm0ke and 3 visitors disagree.\nwhy is it that your entire post deflected to the democrats and completely dodged the topic of the thread, the contents of the actual Republican memo?\nis it because the contents of that memo themselves are indefensible?\nmy entire opening post explained why it was fake. so your opening jab is a miss.\nNunez used half truths to lie to the American people. regardless of the damage that should spark far more outrage.\nthe damage was to sources and methods of intelligence gathering. it makes intelligence gathering harder for our professionals. do you think you as a civilian would notice the damage? did you notice the snowden damage? of course not. what were you expecting the damage to be? an instant invasion? I think you are making arbitrary excuses to avoid laying blame on your party no matter how badly they slapped you and the American people.\nI love how democrats always dissmis the memo as a fake but rarely point out why it's fake. I also remember that democrats stated that the memo would cause major problems and liberal media cites were buzzing with why releasing the memo would bring terrible consequences, yet none of that happened. It's almost as if there was something in that memo democrats didn't want released.\nanyone have any argument for why it wasn't garbage?\nfrankly garbage isn't strong enough. it was outright lies to try to undermine an investigation into potential treasonous activities. when the investigation leads to more charges I hope they investigate Nunes as well for his willful attempt to cover it up.\nit represented the Steele dossier as the only evidence when it was supported by numerous independent sources.\nit said the fbi hide the fact that one of its leads was started for a partisan purpose, but they openly told the judge that, who then judged it valid.\nit forgot to mention that the warrant was renewed several times, meaning it was providing valid intelligence in the eyes of the court. which included numerous republician judges who approved it.\nthis political farce needs to end. cherry picking from classified data to build a false narrative to deceive the American people, there need to be treason charges brought on some. starting with Devon Nunez. if anyone is colluding, it's him.",

    "text": "For the month of April only: Receive Dermapen 4 Face & Neck Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nWe are proud to launch the new Dermapen 4 at Natural Aesthetics. We were the first clinic in South Africa to receive the Dermapen 4. So what makes the Dermapen 4 so much better than the Dermapen 3 or any other microneedling device?\nDermapen 4 has a 16 needle cartridge instead of just 12 needles, reaching an inflammatory response at a much quicker rate.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 47.9% more micro-channels than Dermapen 3 and 104% more micro-channels than any counterfeit device.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 1,920 puncture channels per second, which means we can almost double the amount of serums and actives that we needle into the skin per treatment, than before.\nThe additional 620 micro-channels makes the treatment much quicker and more comfortable than before.\nDermapen 4 is the only microneedling device with a dedicated scar setting and protocols for revision of deep, atrophic scars; including surgical, burn contracture, striae and post-acne scars. Needle penetration can now be increased up to 3.0mm.\nAOVN technology, automatically calibrates the motor speed, pressure and penetration for targeted precision.\nThe Dermapen 4 is safer than other microneedling devices, no dragging or pulling of the skin.\nOnly Dermapen 4 features a unique, medical-grade silicone seal and fluid guard. The external cartridge is fortified with a specialised fluid guard that prevents cross contamination to the outer cartridge shell. Safety First!\nSpecialised retention valves relieve the build-up of procedural pressure within the Dermapen 4 needle cartridge. The effect prevents fluid build-up within the needle cavity. The vacuum-like sensation removes the risk of cross contamination whilst ensuring pressure-free contact to the skin during a procedure.\nTop: Medical grade numbing cream applied for 20 \u2013 30 minutes, we then needle medical grade serums and actives into the skin via the Dermapen 4 device. Bottom: An Alginate Mask is applied and connected to our IonZyme Machine. A medical grade concealer is applied to speed up recovery and cover any immediate post treatment redness.\nThe Dermapen is an award winning micro-needling device.\nWe use the Dermapen 4 to create safe pathways to deliver quality anti-aging serums deep into the skin.\nNew collagen and elastin are now being produced by the body; tightening the skin and healing scars, fine lines and literally keeping the skin young and full of volume.\nWhat is the Dermapen 4 good for?\nSkin conditions: Treat pigmentation, skin texture, oily skin, acne and sun damaged skin.\nThe numbing cream that we apply is a 30% Lidocaine medical-grade numbing cream that is only available at medical practices. Should your skincare \u201cclinic\u201d, not have an overseeing doctor, chances are that you are not receiving the appropriate numbing cream (only a 2% Lidocaine), which can make this treatment uncomfortable.\nThe concentrated actives in the mask are delivered into the skin immediately after a microneedling treatment to instantly cool and soothe the skin and to improve the skins health complexion.\nThe IonZyme machine introduces the use of Pulsed Iontophoresis; the use of a specifically pulsed electrical current to facilitate penetration of vitamins into the cells.\nImmediately post this microneedling treatment, we apply an Alginate mask over the face. We then connected it to our IonZyme Machine to send an electrical current via the mask. This reduces inflammation to speed up recovery. The mask itself is infused with skin corrective peptides and anti-inflammatory actives which makes it the perfect compliment for the skin after a Dermapen treatment.\nNatural Aesthetics is not a spa of \u201cbeauty salon\u201d; we are a medical practice.\nOur Therapists are specially trained to administer medical microneedling and IonZyme Machine treatments safely and correctly.\nEach of our Therapists have also received special training by Dr Wade Merchant to further ensure that our patients receive the safest and most effective treatments.\nFor the month of April only: Receive a Face & Neck Dermapen 4 Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nOR call us on 021 433 0967.",

    "text": "African/Lake Malawi cichlids have very specialised feeding habits that have been adapted so that they can survive in their natural habitat. However aquarists tend to make it easier for themselves by getting readily prepared flakes and pellets. But you will have to take into account whether your fish are herbivores or \u2018piscivores\u2019 (feed on other fish). Mbuna species are normally herbivore, so they will mainly feed on the algae that grows on rocks, so they must be fed on plant food. These fish cannot digest animal fat and will suffer from indigestion if fed on it.\nOn the other hand most Lake Malawi cichlids will eat small crustaceans like Brine Shrimps.\nA lot of cichlid breeders make up their own homemade food, made from chopped up shrimp and peas.\nThaw out the shrimps and peas and mince them finely in a food mixer, then add the vitamin drops. Finally pour in the dissolved gelatine. The gelatine will bind the mixture, producing a thick paste after it has cooled. Place the paste into a freezer bag, flatten and then freeze. Now this nutritious fish food can easily be cut up into convenient pieces, and given to your fish.\nA wide range of foods are commercially available, like flakes and pellets. It has been noticed that cichlids feed very enthusiastically on flakes, while pellets sink to the bottom, so any other inhabitants like catfish can get it. The choice is yours.\nA further important source of food for your African cichlids, are frozen foods like white and black mosquito larvae, brine shrimps and krill.\nMixes including beef heart and frozen RED mosquito larvae are not suitable for Lake Malawi Cichlids.\nHow often you feed your Lake Malawi cichlids depends on their age. Fry (Newly born fish) must be fed more frequently and in smaller portions than older fish. Fry should literally be swimming in food in order to grow quickly and develop properly.\nHerbivores are more used to feeding in small portions over the day, so feeding them once a day will not be enough. And you must take care to only put in the right amount of food. It should take about 1 minute for all of the food to be eaten.\nAdult cichlids should be fed 2-3 times a day while the fry should be fed 5-7 times a day. If the fish are fed regularly then their aggression should be reduced.\nNever feed your fish just after you have switched the light on as they will need reach their full levels of daytime activity. The African cichlids rest at night and it takes them about thirty minutes to become fully active. And for similar reasons, you should not give them their final feed just before turning the light out.\nIf you don\u2019t think that you will be able to feed your fish at the correct times each day, then you should consider installing an automatic feeding machine.\nIt is important not to overfeed your fish as your cichlids will consume anything, and in huge quatities if they can, which can harm their health. Healthy African Cichlids will always await their food eagerly.\nIf an adult cichlid is eating poorly or refusing food then don\u2019t feed them at all for one full day afterwards as it may be overfed. If they still fail to eat after the day off, then they may have contracted a disease.\nThey are. Were they cichlids or tropical fish? Thank you for your comment by the way.\nI love aquarium fish and used to keep quite a few of them. They are a lot of fun and beautiful to watch.",

If possible find an practitioner trained in TFT, EFT or EMDR.\n1. As a child, I heard that my most significant faults were\u2026..\n2. As a child, I felt guilt for /when \u2026.\nThis can be done daily as an exercise in itself or as a prelude to meditation or prayer.\n2. Relax the entire body and mind with any relaxing or concentration technique.\n3. Now imagine or feel your inner child and communicate with it.\nc. Express to the child your needs and goals as an adult.\n4. Give it the positive reinforcement it needs to hear about love, security and worth.\n5. Embrace the child mentally with tenderness and love.\n1. Write the story of your childhood years.\nb. It doesn?t need to be in chronological order.\nc. You can write in the third or first person.\ne. Look at old pictures and seek to remember how you felt then.\nHaving done so, we now move on to the following process.\nc. What thoughts or to what conclusions did you arrive as a child because of this experience or situation?\ne. What effect did this experience have upon you later in your life or even today?\n1. What did you feel then as a child?\n2. What were your needs and desires?\n3. What did you want them to do or not do?\n(Write the answer in the second person to your parents and / or to others as if you were speaking to them or writing them a letter).\n3. Write letters to the people who played an important role in the unpleasant experiences of your childhood (parents, teachers, uncles, aunts, siblings, grandparents & others).\nNote: It is not necessary to give these letters to the people you are writing them to, only to have expressed them yourself. In some cases, however, once you are clear about this, and have released the emotional charge concerning theses issues, you may want to communicate verbally or in writing with those concerned ? whether they are living or not.\nRemember however that life has given you the experiences you need to proceed in your evolutionary process and that you have probably gained much internally from all this.\n4. Read the letters to someone who is experienced in active listening.\na. If you find that the reading causes strong feelings, express and release them, before you continue reading. Don?t hold these emotions locked inside you.\nb. You may need to read these letters additional times until the emotional charge is released.",

    "text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.",

    "text": "Mark Frigon is a senior product manager with IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization, a key group involved in leading IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce initiative. Mark\u2019s specialties are in Web analytics (he joined IBM as part of its acquisition of Coremetrics) and Internet privacy, an issue that has come to the forefront in recent years for digital marketers around the globe.\nEffective Web metrics are critical to the success of businesses looking to succeed in e-commerce and digital marketing these days, and IBM has a number of experts who spend a lot of their time in this area.\nOne of those here in Madrid at the IBM Smarter Commerce Global Summit, Mark Frigon, is a senior product manager for Web analytics in IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization.\nMark sat down with me to discuss the changing nature of Web analytics, and how dramatically it has evolved as a discipline over the past few years, including the increased focus by marketers on \u201cattribution,\u201d the ability to directly correlate a Web marketing action and the desired result.\nMark also spoke at the event about the importance for digital marketers around the globe to be more privacy-aware, a topic we also discussed in our time together, calling out in particular the \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d industry self-regulatory effort that intends to put privacy controls in the hands of consumers.\nIf you spend any time thinking about Internet privacy or Web analytics, or both, this is a conversation you won\u2019t want to miss.\nRemember that team of blackjack-playing cohorts from MIT in the book (and, later, movie) \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d who fleeced a number of Vegas casinos before they were invited never to grace their gambling doors again?\nIBM\u2019s Yuchun Lee explains to the IBM Smarter Commerce audience in Madrid how the company is doubling down on its investments in enterprise and social marketing management.\nWell, IBM executive and Unica co-founder Yuchung Lee was one of those who was asked not to come back. Permanently.\nWhich is okay by those of us at IBM, as we\u2019re keeping him way too busy to bother with card counting.\nInstead, Lee\u2019s mathematical prowess is being applied to help companies improve their marketing capabilities, a key ingredient in the IBM Smarter Commerce soup.\nAs Lee explained in his keynote session this afternoon here in Madrid, \u201cthis is the first time we\u2019re bringing together Coremetrics and Unica.\u201d He also highlighted the fact that out of the 1,700 participants here at the Summit, over 1,000 are marketeers!\nLee provided a broad overview of the Enterprise Marketing Management portfolio at IBM, explaining that \u201cwe\u2019ve shared progress as a group within IBM over the past year,\u201d sharing that also incorporates lessons learned from both the market and IBM customers.\nThe social buildout also incorporates enterprise analytics, tag management, and full mobile and social market capabilities that tie more closely together the marketing automation experience with the social realm.\nLee also debriefed quickly on two recent acquisitions, DemandTec, which expands IBM\u2019s EMM offerings with pricing, promotion, and product mix optimization, and Tealeaf, which rounds out IBM EMM solutions with customer experience management and analytics.\nAs Lee explained, \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what TeaLeaf provides, the ability to look at snapshots of individual user sessions to help determine where, exactly, it is that you\u2019re driving them crazy with your convoluted web experience!\nBut where Lee really \u201chooked\u201d the audience was in his observations about the Generation C customer, who is more connected and in control than ever! Did you know that 4 in 10 smartphone users search for an item in a store? Or that 77 percent of B2B buyers check with their peers before buying?\nWhich, he expanded, means that it must work more closely with other disciplines and functions, including merchandising, on- and offline sales, customer service, and even with IT.\nBut, Lee indicated, they can\u2019t stop there. Marketing must also share customer insights with other parts of the business so that all functions can benefit from these insights.\nFinally, they must extend that sharing of customer insights with other key stakeholders who can benefit: Partners, agencies, customer communities, and so forth.\nLee also explained that many organizations must adjust their marketing cultures to fully capitalize on the \u201cGeneration C\u201d (\u201cC\u201d for \u201cconnected\u201d) culture. They must build organizations that balance analytics and creative talents (easier said than done!), work with IT rather than around IT, and break down marketing siloes \u2014 digital and traditional marketing must consolidate and collaborate.\nFinally, accept mistakes and learn from them, and be agile enough to iterate and improve upon them. As even Lee can explain, there are only so many opportunities to double down in blackjack, and in business.\nThe enterprise marketing management opportunity vis-a-vis IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce strategy is one of those rare opportunities.\nWell, that day of the year has finally arrived.\nThat day where we all slink into our offices after four nice, long, official holidays where (mostly, we hope) people stay away from their computers and mobile phones and tablets and God knows whatever other else connected devices just long enough to make it feel like you got some real rest (even though many of you were probably dealing with unrelated, but similarly frustrating, realities \u2014you know, like screaming kids and antagonizing in-laws).\nAnd all you could do was think about how nice it would be to come back into the nice peaceful and quiet office on Monday so you could get back to\u2026shopping.\nYes, boys and girls, cyber Monday has arrived.\nBut judging from the results of the IBM Coremetrics Benchmark Black Friday e-retailing analysis, you really need not worry about coming into the office anymore just so you can get yourself an extra slurp of broadband.\nThis is 2011, yo, all you gotta do is break out that iPad and you\u2019ll be standing in front of Macys women\u2019s wear or Best Buy\u2019s electronics section in seconds!\nBut while you\u2019re out there figuring out your Cyber Monday strategy, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights reel for the weekend in e-shopping.\nU.S shoppers apparently took great advantage of early sales this holiday, driving a 39.3 percent year-over-year increase in online Thanksgiving day spending while setting the stage for 24.3 percent online growth on Black Friday compared to the same period last year.\nConsumer spending increases. The aggressive shopping we witnessed on Thanksgiving Day this year carried over into Black Friday, with online sales increasing 24.3 percent annually.\nMobile Bargain Hunting. Black Friday also saw the arrival of the mobile deal seeker who embraced their devices as a research tool for both in-store and online bargains. Mobile traffic increased to 14.3 percent (compared to 5.6 percent last year).\nMobile Sales On the Getgo. Sales on mobile devices surged to 9.8 percent (a tripling from last year\u2019s 3.2 percent).\nApple\u2019s One Stop Shop. Mobile shopping was led by Apple, with the iPhone and iPad ranking one and two for consumers shopping on mobile devices (5.4 percent and 4.8 percent respectively). Together, the iPhone and iPad accounted for 10.2 percent of all online retail. Apparently, it ain\u2019t easy bein\u2019 an Android on Black Friday.\nThe iPad Factor. Shoppers using the iPad led to more retail purchases more often per visit than other mobile devices, leading one to wonder about the real estate to deal closing ratio. The bigger the device, the larger the average order value? Possibly, but this number can\u2019t lie: Conversion rates for the iPad were 4.6 percent, compared to 2.8 for all other mobile devices. The iPad was this weekend\u2019s e-shopping mobile king.\nSocial Influence. Shoppers referred from Social Networks generated 0.53 percent of all online sales on Black Friday, with Facebook leading the pack and accounting for a full 75 percent of all social network traffic.\nSocial Media Chit Chat. Boosted by a 110 percent increase in discussion volume compared to 2010, top discussion topics on social media sites immediately before Friday showed a focus on the part of consumers to share tips on how to avoid the rush. Topics included out-of-stock concerns, waiting times and parking, and a spike in positive sentiment around Cyber Monday sales.\nSurgical Shopping Goes Mobile: Mobile shoppers demonstrated a laser focus that surpassed that of other online shoppers with a 41.3 percent bounce rate on mobile devices versus online shopping rates of 33.1 percent.\nThis data came from findings of the IBM Coremetrics fourth annual Black Friday Benchmark, which tracks more than a million transactions a day, analyzing terabytes of raw data from 500 retailers nationwide.\nWith this data, IBM helps retailers better understand and respond to their customers \u2014 across the organization \u2014 improving sourcing, inventory management, marketing, sales, and services programs.\nYou can get more background on the study here.\nBlack Friday: U.S. Online Retail Up 20% Year-Over-Year!\nI had absolutely nothing to do with shopping today, online or off. But I seemed to have been a minority, and for those retailers looking to the holiday season to help bolster an otherwise anemic year, they will be excited by the news delivered today by the IBM Coremetrics e-retailing Black Friday Benchmark Report.\nNo flies on those guys! Apparently they were too busy counting everyone else\u2019s clicks to pursue any of their own.\nClick image to enlarge. Black Friday e-retail sales in U.S. were up 20% over the same period last year, with consumers turning to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for their e-shopping efforts more than they ever have.\nE-retail sales at major online retailers were up 20 percent as of 3 P.M. EST this afternoon, compared to the same time on the Friday after Thanksgiving last year.\nThe survey monitors some 500 major U.S. Online retailers, and the 20 percent is in line with the 20 percent year-over-year increase IBM was reporting mid-day yesterday. However, apparently lots of folks are holding out until they\u2019ve allowed the turkey trytophan to kick in and the evening football games to start, because full-day online Thanksgiving sales ended 39 percent up over the holiday last year and they soared Thursday evening.\nMobile devices also played a much bigger role in online shopping this year, according to the benchmark. Shoppers are making 9.73 percent of their purchases from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, about the same as Thanksgiving day. And, as much as 17.37 percent of traffic to e-retail sites is coming from mobile devices, higher than even the 15.2 recorded yesterday.\nConsumer spending increased: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9 percent, with consumers pushing the average order value up from $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent.\nLuxury goods are making a comeback. Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6 percent increase in sales.\nSocial shopping. Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their favorite brands\u2019 social presence, and are turning to their social networking friends for information about deals and inventory levels.\nThough the percentage of visitors arriving from social sites is fairly small relative to all online visitors \u2014 nearly 1 percent \u2014 it\u2019s gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space.\nDepartment stores. They\u2019ve become the research engine of choice for consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over year on department store sites.\nHealth and Beauty. A reported rise of 73.1 percent in the number of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a 53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed an order.\nIn-Store Sales for Consumer Electronics and Appliances. These are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to an analytics-based forecast from IBM\u2019s Global Business Services division.\nU.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, which has led to strong pent-up demand for consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in today\u2019s economy.\nStay tuned here on the Turbo blog for other upcoming reports on the holiday season\u2019s retail tidings. It\u2019s still Black Friday, we still have the weekend, and Cyber Monday is a full three days away!\nThe weekend in sports proved to be as about as exciting as I had hoped.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Darren Clarke became the third man from that region to win a golf major in 3 of the last 6, and it was Clarke\u2019s first British Open title.\nAnd as to the U.S. Women\u2019s soccer team, they played a nailbiter of a match, but in the end the team from Japan won on penalty kicks.\nMy hat goes off to both teams. I had a whole living room full of soccer fans, and we were all nervous wrecks up to that last penalty kick that gave Japan this year\u2019s World Cup trophy.\nStill, it was an awesome game all the way around, and I wish my friends in Japan a very happy celebration. They could probably stand some good news about now!\nLater today, IBM will announces its second quarter 2010 earnings. You can check the Investor Relations site for more details.\nOn the announcement front, today saw the introduction of a new cloud-based Web analytics and digital marketing suite intended to help organizations automate online marketing campaigns across their online channels, including web sites, social media networks, and even mobile phones.\nThe new offering combines the best of Coremetrics and Unica, and provides analytics that help companies better determine the effectiveness of new products and services, fine tune their marketing campaigns, and create personalized offers in real-time across channels.\nWith 64 percent of consumers making a first purchase because of a digital experience, it\u2019s critical that marketers understand online behavior and refine their marketing activities accordingly.\nSupports deep analysis into how customers interact with a brand over time and when each marketing program is the most effective.\nUsing this technology, businesses will be able to evaluate Facebook or Twitter activity, and offer customers tailored promotions delivered to their mobile devices on the fly.\nIBM\u2019s suite also enables businesses to deliver and fine tune digital marketing programs based on what customers are doing offline.\nFor example, a consumer who purchased a new tablet in a brick-and-mortar store would receive special offers via email to purchase tablet accessories.\nThe benefit to the customer is a consistent, relevant brand experience that reflects all of their online preferences, not just what they did, read or saw on one specific site.\nThe IBM Coremetrics Web Analytics and Digital Marketing Optimization Suite is the newest addition to IBM\u2019s family of Smarter Commerce solutions,which is focused on helping companies more effectively market, sell and secure greater customer loyalty in the era of social networking and mobile computing.\nSmarter Commerce transforms how companies manage and swiftly adapt to customer and industry trends across marketing, selling and service processes that span the entire commerce cycle, putting the customer at the center of their decisions and actions.\nTo learn more about this and other marketing solutions please visit the IBM Enterprise Marketing Management site.",

    "text": "during our conversation it became apparent Jerome has developed a great approach to the sport, being backed by a good team, coupled with a dynamic fighting style, he is definitely one to watch.\n\u201cI started boxing when I was 21, so I started late, I just went to the gym with a friend, I had always watched boxing but never took that much of an interest in it.\nAfter I went to the gym once I got a feel for it, everything about it, the environment, the smell of the gym and from there it has catapulted, it became an obsession, it went from a hobby to a lifestyle.\n\u201cI had 35 fights, I won the Haringey box cup, I reached the national finals in 2016, I won London titles twice, so yeah, in the last two years I\u2019ve seen my amateur career take off.\n\u201cYou know what it is, I am a strong believer in timing, and at the age of 26 I wasn\u2019t going to gain much more from the amateurs, as in it might take me away from what I want to do as a pro.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve got guys at the IQ Boxing Gym in Neasden, North West London, my main coach is Xavier Miller, and my promoter is Steve Goodwin. Me and Xavier get along like a house on fire, as much as I like him as a coach, I also do as a person. We have a good understanding and it\u2019s a great relationship.\n\u201cSo, like I said, as an amateur I was relying a lot on reflex, movement, counter punching, but not as a pro, I\u2019m going to focus on sitting my weight down, catching shots, returning shots and working the body.\nI would love to say I can adapt to any shape or style but I have to be realistic, I would say that I\u2019m a thinking fighter, I can work out people\u2019s fight quite quickly so I can entertain different styles.\n\u201cWithout trying to sound arrogant or cocky I feel like I\u2019ve got the makings to go all the way, I feel like I\u2019m destined for great things and it\u2019s a matter of time until everyone else starts to believe it.\nIn 2018 I\u2019m just looking to get the whole experience, and I think if I could get 4 fights this year I would be happy with that, I\u2019m looking to soak up the experience and fight in front of a big hyped up crowd. I\u2019m also sparring 6-8 rounds at the moment so 4 rounds shouldn\u2019t be too bad.\nJerome Campbell makes his debut tonight on Goodwin Boxing\u2019s \u2018Venom\u2019 show at the infamous York Hall. Featuring on a strong card, Jerome is bout #6 of the evening. 4 x 3 minute rounds in the lightweight division, sharing the ring with Luke Fash.",

    "text": "Each year, there are more than 100,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S. Many of these were caused by household substances that may seem perfectly harmless to you. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won\u2019t hurt beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis.\nDepending on how a particular substance affects your dog\u2019s body and how much was ingested or inhaled, pet poisoning symptoms can include gastrointestinal and neurological problems, cardiac and respiratory distress, coma, and even death.\nDog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the opposite effect in pets. And it doesn\u2019t always take a large dose to do major damage.\nPrescription anti-inflammatory and pain medications can cause stomach and intestinal ulcers or kidney failure.\nAntidepressants can cause vomiting and, in more serious instances, serotonin syndrome -- a dangerous condition that raises temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and may cause seizures.\nDog poison No. 2: Insecticides.\nFlea and tick products. You may think you\u2019re doing your dog a favor when you apply products marketed to fight fleas and ticks, but thousands of animals are unintentionally poisoned by these products every year. Problems can occur if dogs accidentally ingest these products or if small dogs receive excessive amounts. Talk to your vet about safe OTC products.\nDog poison No. 3: Over-the-counter medications. This group contains acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen and naproxen (Advil, Alleve), as well as herbal and nutraceutical products (fish oil, joint supplements).\nDog poison No. 4: Pet medications. Just as we can be sickened or killed by medications intended to help us, cases of pet poisoning by veterinary drugs are not uncommon. Some of the more commonly reported problem medications include painkillers and de-wormers.\nDog poison No. 5: Household products, from cleaners to fire logs. Just as cleaners like bleach can poison people, they are also a leading cause of pet poisoning, resulting in stomach and respiratory tract problems. Not surprisingly, chemicals contained in antifreeze, paint thinner, and chemicals for pools also can act as dog poison. The pet poisoning symptoms they may produce include stomach upset, depression, chemical burns, renal failure and death.\nDog poison No. 6: People food. Your canine companion may look so cute as he sits there begging for a bite of your chocolate cake or a chip covered in guacamole, but not giving him what he wants could save his life. Animals have different metabolisms than people. Some foods, such as onions and garlic, as well as beverages that are perfectly safe for people can be dangerous, and sometimes fatal, for dogs.\nChocolate . Though not harmful to people, chocolate products contain substances called methylxanthines that can cause vomiting in small doses, and death if ingested in larger quantities. Darker chocolate contains more of these dangerous substances than do white or milk chocolate. The amount of chocolate that could result in death depends on the type of chocolate and the size of the dog. For smaller breeds, just half an ounce of baking chocolate can be fatal, while a larger dog might survive eating 4 ounces to 8 ounces, though 8 ounces would be extremely dagerous. Coffee and caffeine have similarly dangerous chemicals.\nAlcohol. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning in animals are similar to those in people, and may include vomiting, breathing problems, coma and, in severe cases, death.\nAvocado. You might think of them as healthy, but avocados have a substance called persin that can act as a dog poison, causing vomiting and diarrhea or worse.\nMacadamia nuts. Dogs may suffer from a series of symptoms, including weakness, overheating, and vomiting, after consumption of macadamia nuts.\nGrapes and raisins. Experts aren\u2019t sure why, but these fruits can induce kidney failure in dogs. Even a small number may cause problems in some dogs.\nXylitol. This sweetener is found in many products, including sugar-free gum and candy. It causes a rapid drop in blood sugar, resulting in weakness and seizures. Liver failure also has been reported in some dogs.\nDog poison No. 7: Chocolate. See above.\nAzaleas and rhododendrons. These pretty flowering plants contain toxins that may cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and potentially even death.\nTulips and daffodils. The bulbs of these plants may cause serious stomach problems, difficulty breathing, and increased heart rate.\nSago palms. Eating just a few seeds may be enough to cause vomiting, seizures, and liver failure.\nDog poison No. 9: Rodenticides, if ingested by dogs, can cause severe problems. The symptoms depend on the nature of the poison, and signs may not start for several days after consumption. In some instances, the dog may have eaten the poisoned rodent, and not been directly exposed to the toxin.\nDog poison No. 10: Lawn and garden products. Products for your lawn and garden may be poisonous to pets that ingest them.\nIf you think your dog has been poisoned, try to stay calm. It is important to act quickly, but rationally.\nFirst, gather up any of the potential poison that remains -- this may be helpful to your veterinarian and any outside experts who assist with the case. If your dog has vomited, collect the sample in case your veterinarian needs to see it.\nThen, try to keep your pet calm and call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at (888) 426-4435. Experts at the APCC are available to answer questions and provide guidance 24 hours a day for a $60 consultation fee. Another option is the Pet Poison Hotline with a fee of $59 per incident.\nKeep all medications, even those in child-proof bottles, in cabinets that are inaccessible to your dog. If you inadvertently drop a pill on the floor, be sure to look for it immediately. Supervise anyone, such as the elderly, who may need help taking medications.\nAlways follow guidelines on flea or tick products.\nAlthough you can safely give some ''people foods'' to your pet as a treat, others are toxic. If you have any questions about what is safe, ask your veterinarian. Or, err on the safe side and give treats made specifically for animals.\nBe sure any rodenticides you use are kept in metal cabinets or high on shelves where your pets can't find them. Remember that dogs can be fatally poisoned by eating an exposed rodent, so always be very cautious about using these products. Tell your neighbors if you put out rat bait, so they can protect their pets from exposure, and ask them to do the same for you.\nWhen buying plants for your home, opt for those that won\u2019t cause problems if your dog happens to nibble on them. The ASPCA has an online list of toxic and nontoxic plants by species. If you choose to have toxic plants, be sure they are kept in a place where your animals can't reach them.\nStore all chemicals and cleaners in pet-inaccessible areas of your home.",

This is part 34, to read the other parts click The Rice Field Project. If you are following this project then you might remember that we had an water well made at our land. Well as we will later build a guest bungalow on an other part of our land we had the idea to have a second water well made. The new one closer to our house and use the old one for the garden and guest-bungalow. But that did not go as easy as we thought.\nThe first try was about 5 meter from our house, they found water at 6 meter but not enough to pump it up. Second try was about 10 meter from the first water well. But no water at all was found. So a third try was done about 5 meter next to the first water well. And bingo .... water. And a lot of water.\nSo the location of the first water well was just sheer luck? Anyway we will see how it works out with 2 water wells near to each other. The job was done by the same 3 people of the first water well. And although they had to try 3 times, we only paid for 1 water well, 3.500 Thai baht + some tip for the hard work. Because yes it is hard work, especially at 30\u2103!\nUpdate : And we did just paid the final payment for the house construction. The last 5% will be paid 10 days after 100% completion and delivery of the house.",

    "text": "I\u2019ve never understood the whole points thing, scholarships, etc. for open comps. I don\u2019t do enough open comps for it to matter \u2013 but I\u2019d love to understand it. I\u2019ve tried to look it up and other than the official rules which are like reading a law-book ( in other words make no sense to me!) I can\u2019t find a simple explanation of it all. If anyone can give a layperson\u2019s explanation it would be cool!\nI had to clarify. What to which \u201cpoints\u201d was she referring, exactly?\nMaybe you are referring to being top student or top teacher in a competition or a district or in a competition series? If that is the case, what happens is you get a certain amount of points for each entry you are in (or your instructor dances), and then more points for placing higher. Like when I got top student in San Diego it was like 8 points (or something, I don\u2019t exactly remember the point value) for 1st place, 6 for 2nd, down through 6th and then 1 point for participating. You get more points for participating more and for placing higher. Your instructor gets points for the same things, but obviously if they bring more students and dance more often, they earn more points.\nSo I checked it out, not being familiar with proficiency points. No one had ever mentioned them to me before.\nEllen, I\u2019ve looked at the proficiency point guide and I\u2019m intrigued. Seems to be a complicated system to determine which category you should dance in\u2026what age, what level, as an attempt in making sure people are competing at an appropriate level \u2013 not too high or too low. It says in the guide that USA dance will make a database online of the points so I\u2019m now trying to find that. I\u2019m curious to see where I might rank. I\u2019ve always been told that the instructor decides which category you dance at. It seems like the points might be more important for high level amateur competitors or professional couples. I\u2019ll ask Ivan about it, but who knows if he knows anything about it. It does say that you can be disciplined for dancing below your level! Thanks for asking this question. I love learning more about my favorite sport! I\u2019ll keep you updated.\nThe topic sparked my interest in a number of facets of ballroom dancing that involve points and I had a big \u2018ole conversation with Ivan about it after my lesson today.\nSadly, he didn\u2019t know about proficiency points, but he did comment on another type of points used by ballroom studios which I found intriguing. Also, I did a little more research and found on http://DanceForums.com some old comments about the proficiency points. You can see the comments I found here.\nFirst, the database is not current. I don\u2019t even know if you can find it. Someone who is on the USA Dance board must have been in the conversation because he or she commented that they needed someone to volunteer to keep up with the points. I guess you are supposed to keep track of them yourself! Well, I for one, haven\u2019t been doing that.\nSecond, the link Ellen sent me on the USA Dance page that directs you to the rules about the Proficiency points is outdated. I guess there have been changes (that a couple must now only accrue 200 points instead of the 300 mentioned in the pdf file) that aren\u2019t reflected in that edition of the rules.\nBut the plot thickens. These mystery proficiency points are only applicable to USA Dance sanctioned events.\nUSA Dance isn\u2019t the only governing body of ballroom dance.\nThere are different proficiency points and rules for the National Dance Council of America (NDCA) and the Youth College Network (YCN).\nSo there are points you accrue in competition. But after my conversation with Ivan, I have learned there are also points you can accrue at a studio. Now, I don\u2019t purport to have expertise in this area because I\u2019ve never danced in a ballroom dance franchise studio. I\u2019m going on what Ivan told me. If things are different, feel free to comment below and fill us all in. At least this is what I gather went on at Ivan\u2019s studio when he was employed by a franchised studio.\nStudents accrue points and have proficiency tests to determine what level they are at: pre-bronze, bronze, silver, etc. Then packages are sold around getting to the next level. Like for every lesson you take or every figure you learn it\u2019s recorded and there are charts of points and where you are. There are also charts proclaiming which student is which level, so you can compare yourself to other students and follow your and their progress.\nTo me, this seems a bit weird. I guess it is great for goal setting and is some form of monitoring progress, but just knowing the steps in the gold syllabus doesn\u2019t necessarily, I think, mean you are a gold level dancer \u2013 meaning that you might be dancing a gold step with bronze level technique.\nWhat it does do is give a person a sense of being able to put a feather in their cap. I\u2019ve had people ask me what level dancer I am, but since I have no points or proficiency tests to go on, I honestly don\u2019t know. I have no idea what level the steps I know are considered nor my level in terms of technique.\nSeems like another VCR manual to me, but at least this one only applies to amateurs. I still don\u2019t know what this means if I\u2019m dancing Pro/Am since my proficiency in Pro/Am shall not be used in determining my amateur proficiency level\u2026.though I don\u2019t dance Am/Am, myself!\nSheesh! I think it\u2019s an interesting topic, but still kind of a mystery even after all this writing and after all the various research!\nSo, now the ball is in your court. Do you know anything about points tracked in ballroom? What do you think of these point systems? Does your studio use them? How? Have you heard of them in the context of NDCA or USA Dance? Have you kept track of yours? What do they mean\u2026.really? I\u2019m curious to know.\nOoohhh, I\u2019m a bit nervous writing this post, but I think it is a very important subject that is not often talked about. It kind of relates to my previous post about when learning to dance that you make sure you find an instructor that can teach in a way that you can understand and process. And if it\u2019s not working out, to feel free to move on to a different instructor who can suit your needs. Sometimes that can be a little tricky. One of those situations where it is easier said, than done.\nThe topic I\u2019m talking about is whether or not as a dance student we are free agents, at liberty to dance with whichever instructor we desire and the sometimes-weird possessiveness that the instructor or studio may exhibit for his/her/its students.\nWhen it all boils down, I personally believe that I am the customer, I am the one paying to learn, and I should be able to go wherever I want to do that.\nHowever, it actually isn\u2019t as black and white as that. It isn\u2019t as easy to navigate as one might think.\nHopefully you can avoid some of the difficulties I\u2019ll mention by doing \u201cdancer-views\u201d before settling on a particular instructor. I plan to write a post later on about how to go about the process of finding and selecting an instructor, so I\u2019ll leave that for another time. However, even if you do your due diligence, it may not always be possible to stay with your current instructor indefinitely. Life happens. I\u2019m with my third instructor, and in both previous cases, there were life events that pushed that change along.\nBut for now (and for what I hope is a long, long time to come) as you know from the blog, my primary instructor is Ivan, who is an independent dance instructor. He is my #1. Any place I go to take group classes or whatever (unless it is just social dancing or I\u2019m not there enough for it to matter and it\u2019s none of their business) is aware of my instructor. Conversely, Ivan is aware that I take group classes at Inna\u2019s studio, and I often inform him if I go social dancing as well, out of courtesy.\nWith Ivan, he has made it clear that if I want to dance with other instructors for ballroom, then I need to not dance with him. Coaching would be a different situation, or a lesson with Marietta or Nona as a one time deal for styling or something would be fine too, and he\u2019d know about it.\nBut if I want to learn something that he doesn\u2019t have expertise in, like West Coast Swing, or Argentine Tango, then I just have to tell him my desire and he\u2019d be cool with that. That is the arrangement we have set up. But the point is, we had a conversation about it. At no point did I go behind his back and do things. I wouldn\u2019t want to risk losing him as an instructor. We have this agreement set up and I respect it.\nSomehow, however, I\u2019ve managed to be dancing at like three different places (sometimes more), but this is not, from what I\u2019ve heard, the \u201cnorm\u201d when it comes to ballroom dancing. And if you are going to go that road, it is extremely, extremely important to be respectful of the professionals at each location, as well as their students, and the relationships between them. It is extremely, extremely important to be upfront and clear on what relationship you have to each place you dance. Otherwise, things can get very messy, very quickly!\nFrom my past personal experience, and from that of others who have shared with me, some teachers and studios can become almost possessive of their students. I can even understand it, to a point. They want to protect their business and that only makes sense. However, I feel like it comes from a scarcity mindset \u2013 the idea that the instructor or studio has to keep the student away from any other dance influences for fear that the new or different dance instructor or class may \u201csteal\u201d the student away is focused on a fear of losing something. From my perspective, it isn\u2019t possible to steal a student. If you are providing the value a student is looking for, they won\u2019t go anywhere, no matter how many \u201cother\u201d group classes they take, or instructors they are exposed to. This would be an abundant mindset.\nBut the fact is, some of the studios just don\u2019t offer everything a person might be looking for. Not everyone offers Lindy Hop, or ballet. If I can\u2019t get those at my primary studio, and I want them, I should be at liberty to go elsewhere to find them. My primary studio can always take that as feedback and grow such areas if they so desire. But to prevent me, threaten me, or guilt me into not doing more dancing if I have that desire, I feel is poor behavior. To allow myself to let any threat, or guilt deter me from what I really want is not okay either.\nHowever, there is really something to be said for sticking with one instructor or studio when its good for you, even if it is tough. Sometimes there are issues to work through, even if you adore your instructor. I\u2019ve had a lesson or two with Ivan where we had to get clear on a few things and it wasn\u2019t necessarily comfortable. But I\u2019d choose being uncomfortable and having open, honest communication, than to lose a fab instructor any day of the week. That is just me.\nAgain, as mentioned in a previous post, there isn\u2019t necessarily one \u201cright\u201d way, the be-all and end-all way of dancing. That means that each instructor you learn from will give you some similar information, and some very different information than others. This can be very confusing and muddle the clarity of your dancing. A person has to be careful of not always thinking the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It might be very green right where you are. Sticking it out with your instructor may be the best choice you ever make. Also, if you do decide to receive instruction from multiple sources, be aware that you may need to filter some of the information and make sure that you apply those things that will best serve you while leaving the rest behind. This will take discernment on your part.\nIf the time does come when you feel the need to change instructors, I\u2019d encourage you to do it in as clean, clear, and honest manner as possible. Although some people just stop taking lessons, not only can this strain your relationship with the instructor and the studio, but it steals the opportunity for the instructor or studio to respond to your issue, and even if the issue can\u2019t be amended, it robs them of the feedback you could provide so they don\u2019t recreate the same pitfall with another student.\nSo, to answer the primary question of this post, am I a free agent? Yes\u2026and no. Yes, because I take classes at a variety of places that I feel will enhance and enrich my dancing. But no, because I am very clear that Ivan is my primary ballroom instructor and I\u2019m not going anywhere else for that. I mean, the entire relationship is built on trust. You can\u2019t have trust if you are not engaging in open, honest communication or going behind someone\u2019s back. I guarantee it will show up in your dancing.\nWhat about you? Do you only dance with one instructor at one location? Why? How does that work for you? Or do you dance a lot of places? What positive or negative experiences can you share around that? What advice would you give someone who was considering dancing more than one place or changing instructors? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!",

My 400mm f/2.8 lens would have worked nicely, it would allow me to zoom into the moon to fill the frame and still let plenty of light in to give me the best chance of a capture. I ran into two problems. First off, doubled \u2013 the 400mm 2.8 lens goes to 800mm f/5.6. Then, the more zoomed in you are, the more the movement of the subject in the frame. I had settled on a 1.4x extender which would get me close to 600mm with just a one stop penalty to put me at f/4.\nNext was the camera. I have a Canon Rebel 35mm film SLR that I bought on eBay for $1. It had controller issues, but thankfully the camera just so happened to work set to manual. I gave the inside a coat of urethane, set up some glass guides to hold a plate and shot it. 600mm, f/4 \u2013 ten seconds. And that\u2019s the plate you see to the right.\nFast forward ten or so months I just so happen to be interested in seeing what I can achieve with the setup again. My converted SLR has since gone missing in the attic and I really didn\u2019t want to permanently convert one of my many other 35mm film SLR cameras to wet plate. So for a few minutes I looked at the back of the camera and came up with a game plan on a plate holder that turned a 35mm camera into a wet plate camera.. And the best thing was that it was reversible. That is, if you\u2019re careful to not drip corrosive silver nitrate into the body.\nBecause the material is just a millimeter and a half thick I decided to hollow the center with no corners and then just stick corners on myself with a good metal to plastic glue. The corners themselves are cut pieces of trophy plate.\nOnce the glue was dried the holder gives a nice snug fit in the film compartment of the Canon Rebel 35mm body! I hope to get to making some images soon with it!",
