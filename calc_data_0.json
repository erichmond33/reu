This is now maybe 3 months ago and the site is ranking on first page for a lot of my targeted keywords.\nbuild more you can in starting but do manual submission and not spammy type means manual + relevant to the post.. then after 1 month you can make a big blast..\nWow, dude, you built 18k backlinks a day on a brand new site? How quickly did you rank up? What kind of competition/searches did those keywords have?",
