    "text": "Are film trailers spoiling movies?\nIn April we asked if high ticket prices were ruining your visits to the cinema. Yes, you said overwhelmingly. But something else has put a strain on my relationship with the cinema \u2013 and it\u2019s not the popcorn.\nHave you ever gone to your local cinema to watch a new film only to feel you\u2019ve seen it before? I know I have. \u2018Spoilerific\u2019 film trailers are now often so detailed it seems hardly worth watching the movie itself.\nImagine if the trailer for Casablanca told you whether Ingrid Bergman went off with Humphrey Bogart or Paul Henreid at the end. Or if the trailer for Citizen Kane revealed just what the dying man meant when he muttered the word \u2018Rosebud\u2019.\nAnd it seems that even some film directors agree. Colin Trevorrow, director of new film, Jurassic World, has said he think that trailers have shown far more of the film than he would have wanted.\nIn the last couple of months, I\u2019ve paid \u00a317.50 a ticket to see two films I\u2019ve been anticipating for some time. OK \u00a317.50 sounds steep, but that was for iMAX 3D and I\u2019d still have paid more than \u00a310 for a \u2018normal\u2019 ticket.\nBut I left the cinema unfulfilled, because I felt like I\u2019d seen them both six months before.\nIn both cases the trailer revealed the entire structure of the story, key plot twists and expensive action sequences. Throw in a few character deaths for good measure and you\u2019ve got the basis of a significant chunk of what you\u2019ve paid your money for.\nI really did feel cheated by what the studio had wanted me to see in advance.\nSo is this just a modern trend? I checked out trailers for 1981\u2019s Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1964\u2019s Goldfinger to get a bigger picture.\nBoth revealed some well-known scenes (including Goldfinger\u2019s iconic laser and dialogue), but the plot basics were instead explained by voiceover, rather than any especially huge visual giveaways.\nBesides, the chance of actually seeing these trailers was significantly lessened due to the technology available at the time of release. Which got me thinking further.\n\u2018If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch it\u2019, I hear you cry. I wish it were that simple. In the age of the internet, exposure has increased tenfold.\nMarketing campaigns target social media and television, while the days of a simple poster are gone. Why commission a still image when you can display scenes from the film on a screen in a station or other public place?\nNot only that, but trailers are also forced upon you in the cinema itself before other films. Without a blindfold and a soundproof booth to hide in you have little choice.\nIt\u2019s not that I have a problem with marketing and ads. But they\u2019re spoiling the experience. I don\u2019t want to see all the best bits wrapped up into two minutes, six months ahead of release.\nHave you had a film spoiled by its trailer/marketing? Is Hollywood revealing too much in a desperate attempt to put bums on seats?\nDo ticket prices ruin your film-going experience?\nSomething George mentioned earlier about Terminator 2 trailer jogged my memory about another film from the same franchise, Terminator Genisys.\nTo promote the film, a trailer had been released that included a major plot twist ACTUALLY in the trailer. Now, I had heard about this trailer and had been purposely avoiding it. However, even when you try to avoid spoilers, sometimes it\u2019s out of your control. When I went to see Mad Max, they showed the afore-mentioned trailer and before I realised, it was too late. It cannot be unseen.\nEven the director, Alan Taylor, was unhappy about the spoilers in the trailer.\nGenisys was [spoiler alert] \u2026.. indeed half of the inspiration for this convo. I saw that article about Alan Taylor\u2019s thoughts the other day, but could only sympathise so much as the film was, in my opinion, a travesty.\nHave you seen the film now Ryan? If so what did you think of the big \u2018reveal\u2019? For a film that had very little else going for it that really did completely spoil the experience for me.\nI just can\u2019t understand why that decision was taken. You don\u2019t need to resort to something like that to generate interest \u2013 if said twist is that good then word of mouth will spread.\nFor anyone interested, the trailer for the new Bond film was released today.",

Vecindario is asking for \u20ac700,000 as part of a polemic collaboration deal that was cancelled on the past year.\nThe conflict between Deportivo and Vecindario is now threatening Deportivo.

    "text": "Last night a few of us from The Bier Abbey had the opportunity to stop down the Capital Region\u2019s newest brewery, Rare Form Brewing Company, meet owners Kevin Mullen and Jenny Kemp, check out the new space, and of course try some beers they had on tap. It was a breath of fresh air, for both the continuation of the improvement of Troy, but also for the craft beer scene in the Upstate New York.\nThe taproom itself looks bigger than it really is, given that the brewery is directly behind the bar. The bar area holds about 40 people, with a small room off to the side available for private groups or holding tastings. Stools and standing room are available at the bar, while there are some tables and benches off to each side.\nThe brew house is a Beast 5 BBL system from Psycho Brew that allows for brewing either a double batch or two beers at the same time, which will be nice to do some smaller experimental batches.\nThe taps are split between the two sides of the bar, each side with its own glass rinser, which is good to see (nothing worse than putting good beer in a dirty glass). There will be a couple of nitro offerings, as well.\nWhile looking around I was a little confused exactly where their cooler was, not realizing there was a downstairs not readily visible from the bar. Kevin took me for a quick tour of the cooler they made themselves. It looks like they have plenty of Rare Form branded cooperage hiding out down there.\nBack at the bar, glass sizes vary depending on the beer and ABV, and as Todd pointed out last night it would be nice to see glass sizes listed on the chalkboard as well. There are still some folks who don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d that not all beers are meant to be served in a 16 ounce glass, and it can be a shock when someone is served a beer in a glass half the size than what they were expecting.\nAs for the beers themselves, I\u2019ll be honest, whenever I walk into a new brewery opening up in the Capital Region, I have my reservations and things were no different yesterday at Rare Form. I\u2019ve been burned more often than I would like to admit by local brewers who started as homebrewers, were encouraged by friends and family to start brewery, and never really upped their game. Kevin has been brewing in various stages for \u201cmore than half [his] life\u201d at this point, and I gotta say I walked away extremely impressed.\nSabbatical Session Ale \u2013 a session rye ale coming in under 4% ABV with enough rye to keep things interesting without being over the top by the end of the glass.\nL\u2019homme Chat Belgian Black Ale \u2013 an odd beer, as \u201csession Belgian black ale\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily roll off the tongue but this definitely worked surprisingly well. I thought about adding this in Untappd but I couldn\u2019t figure out what style to consider this. I\u2019ll let someone else figure it out. Also below 4%.\nWee Plaid Scottish Ale \u2013 tons of malty caramel notes without being cloying.\nCascadia Double IPA \u2013 a DIPA with a \u201cmalty backbone\u201d and some piney, some citrusy hops.\nKarass Robust Porter \u2013 a classic porter I was unfair to compare side by side with Hill Farmstead\u2019s Everett. Still, Karass held it\u2019s own and had a simple, but great roasty flavor.\nSatan\u2019s Gut Oak-Aged Imperial Stout \u2013 a big beer, with some coffee notes and oak present from the oak chips but not much from the bourbon the chips were soaked in.\nFirst off, all of the beers were extremely drinkable. I like the focus on the session beers which are already very popular this year and\u2026 I feel bad that I need to even say this but\u2026 none of them had any glaring flaws or tasted like the dreaded \u201chomebrew on a bigger system\u201d as mentioned above. I\u2019m sure Kevin is going to do some tweaks as he gets used to brewing consequetive batches on this much bigger system and the beers are only going to improve.\nThe one change I would love to see would be with the Cascadia Double IPA. Just from a demographic perspective, in 2014, in this location, we live where New England\u2019s Gandhi Bot and Coriolis will kick in a matter of hours. We have no problem driving to MA to Tree House or VT to Alchemist/Hill/Lawson\u2019s for IPAs. And Rushing Duck\u2019s War Elephant is one of our most popular local beers. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that malty and piney are not characteristics Capital Region folks are craving for in their IPA, and most of the time any malt presence in an IPA is usually considered \u201cold\u201d to beer geeks these days. I\u2019d love to see Rare Form offer another IPA where the malt steps aside and lets some super juicy, tropical, citrusy notes shine, as that\u2019s more in line with what\u2019s popular in the Northeast today.\nBeyond the beer, some Rare Form swag is also available including shirts, sweatshirts and aluminum growlers for beer to go, although I did not see pricing for growler fills. No #properglassware yet but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll happen down the road.\nAs Rare Form is the beginning of the transformation of the corner of Congress St and 4th, I got the chance to check out the progress with the rest of the space, including The Shop, a beer bar that\u2019s adjacent to the brewery. The opening is still a couple of months out, but some of the detail in the work happening there currently looks insanely good. A delicatessen at the corner of the building is also in the works and overall the building is shaping up nicely.\nAs some of you know, I\u2019m a little (OK, a lot) harsh on breweries in Upstate NY. Living here, but having such great beer being made in all around us in New England has definitely made me a little jaded at this point. The big breweries in New York seem to be on cruise control, taking little to no risk with new beers. The smaller breweries, while opening up in rapid numbers haven\u2019t done much to shake things up either, and most wouldn\u2019t meet the standards set for the beers poured at The Bier Abbey (the only one I can think of off the top of my head that does would be Rushing Duck).\nThat said I have high hopes for Rare Form. They have a great brand, a website that looks like those of an established brewery, a small, but well put together tasting room, and brewing equipment that doesn\u2019t look like it is meant for homebrew or cobbled together from used parts from other breweries. Not to mention they are making some beer that\u2019s worthy of my recommendation to friends and fellow beer geeks for a brewery visit, and I would gladly serve to a patron at The Abbey if and when they\u2019re producing enough liquid for distribution. I see a lot of potential for Rare Form, and I wish Kevin and Jenny the best of luck.\nRare Form\u2019s Grand Opening is tomorrow, Friday May 30th at 4:30PM. Make sure to head down there to check them out!\nYou lift me up, then you let me down. I\u2019m talking about that Cascadia IPA of course. (I think it\u2019s a bit aspirational to call an 8.8% ABV beer a \u201cdouble\u201d. Imperial, maybe.) War Elephant, now that\u2019s an IPA to my liking. Hope the folks at Rare Form are paying attention to your comments.\nEven if they keep Cascadia the way it is there are still room for other IPAs in their lineup as well. Not that Cascadia is bad, just not the style I was hoping for.\nI had the Wee Plaid, Sabbatical and Satan\u2019s Gut when the owners came down for a cheese tasting at The Cheese Traveler. Most breweries in the Upstate area put out mediocre beer. Rare Form is not most breweries. I must say the Sabbatical is an excellent session ale.\nI think the Sabbatical is my favorite beer they do so far. Such great flavor out of a such a small beer, exactly what I want as these temps warm up.",

Her charm, confidence and regal style captured the imagination of the American public when she hosted the President and Mrs. Eisenhower at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. Wearing a magnificent pale green crinoline evening dress - hand-embroidered with sequins, pearls, beads and diamante - she regally displayed her passion for fashion. Now, in honor of that historic occasion, The Hamilton Collection recreates her royal look with the Reflections of Queen Elizabeth II Figurine, an exclusive, limited-edition first-ever.\nEvery inch of this handcrafted figurine is skillfully crafted and painted by hand, from her regal pose and sculptured fur wrap to the intricate bas-relief floral pattern on her gown. Soft pearlescent and brilliant metallic gold paints accentuate the bas-relief to wonderfully reflect the design of the original dress, while metallic silver paint and glitter accents adorn her tiara and jewelry. And if all that weren't enough, her breathtaking gown is lavished with 90 individually hand-set Swarovski\u00ae crystals - like the ones the queen still uses to accent her gorgeous ensembles today! A beveled-edge, polished mirror base, graced with the queen's golden royal crest, further reflects the beauty of this glorious Royal Family collectible, which includes a Collector's Card featuring details about the iconic gown it depicts.",

    "text": "When it comes to divorce in Salt Lake City, each party has a lot to lose\u2013especially if you have children or significant assets. One of the most complex issues is the division of assets and property. Utah law requires the distribution to be equitable. In many divorce cases, both parties are unable to agree how to divide property and assets. It can often create an acrimonious situation. An experienced and knowledgeable Salt Lake City divorce lawyer can often make the difference between getting the settlement you deserve to losing everything you have rightfully earned.\nIn most Utah divorces, there are three major assets that are usually involved\u2013the home, personal property and retirement plans/investments. Here is a brief rundown on how Utah courts determine equitable asset and property division.\nHome & Property: Many of the most heated divorce cases in Salt Lake City involve which party is entitled to receive the home. The court can use several different methods of determination. Here are the most common depending on the circumstances of each case. First, the court may order the house to be sold and equity divided among the two parties. The court may also allow one party to buy out the other person\u2019s interest in the real property. Another common ruling is to have the property awarded to one party and the remaining assets of equal value given to the other.\nPersonal Property: Personal property is classified as the ownership of any material possessions that can be moved. It includes cars, furniture, and clothing. While most people do not share clothes, the determination of vehicles and furniture can sometimes become complex\u2013especially if they are co-owned by each party. Utah courts place a priority on dividing personal property equitably.\nRetirement Plans & Investments: The division of retirement and investment accounts can sometimes get complicated under Utah family law. If only one party has a pension or retirement plan, in most cases the other party is entitled to half of the amount earned during the time of the marriage. Any money earned before the marriage will not be divided. If both parties have their names on investment or retirement plans, the court can rule either two ways. Both individuals can retain the full value of their own plans or the court will order an equitable distribution of all accounts.\nIn a perfect world, divorcing couples can agree to divide assets and property on their own. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. But there are some solutions to come up with a reasonable agreement. One viable option is mediation. Many Salt Lake City divorce attorneys offer mediation services to help couples find common ground on some of the most difficult family law issues. Under Utah family law, both parties are required to undergo at least one mediation session to attempt to resolve their differences. A mediator is an independent arbitrator who can listen to both sides explain their issues and concerns. It is often a less stressful alternative to court is also far less expensive than going through the conventional divorce process.\nTo learn more about your options concerning the division of assets and property, contact Salt Lake City divorce attorney Emy A. Cordano for a consultation today.",

    "text": "Considering last fall\u2019s wet weather and the soggy fields this spring, farmers wonder about using inoculants on soybean seed in 2010. Should you use a rhizobium inoculant? Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don\u2019t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says. This process, nitrogen fixation, is critical for producing high soybean yields. For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn\u2019t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn\u2019t recommended because it typically doesn\u2019t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems. The total number of nodules that form decreases with increasing amounts of applied N.\nToday, most fields in the Midwest have had soybeans grown on them in the crop rotation, likely increasing population density of Bradyrhizobia bacteria in the soil, notes Saeugling. Improved inoculant technology, coupled with higher commodity prices, ease of application and relatively low-cost inoculant products, have many growers reconsidering the use of inoculants.\nSince 2003, ISU agronomists have conducted trials each year to assess new inoculants on the market. Overall, the ISU studies haven\u2019t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven\u2019t been grown in the field for the past three to five years. Other situations where it\u2019s recommended to inoculate are if soil pH is below 6.0, or if a field has sandy soil, or if a field has been flooded for more than a week, creating anaerobic conditions.\nRising cost of production and volatile commodity prices are driving the need for soybean growers to improve profits. But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently. In fact, using inoculants on soybeans without an active on-farm testing program could be costing you money. But if a field hasn\u2019t produced soybeans in the past three to five years or has never produced soybeans, an inoculant is needed for nitrogen fixation to occur.",

The executive order frees Price to take aim at covered women\u2019s health services that providers, insurers, and employers may find objectionable under their religious beliefs. Price has an antiquated and paternalistic perspective that men should be in charge of the type of health care services a woman have access to.\nConscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate promulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.\nReligious liberty is our country\u2019s first freedom. Americans of faith play a vital role in caring for our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly and the poor.\nWe welcome today\u2019s executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to reexamine the previous administration\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services mandate, and commend President Trump for taking a strong stand for religious liberty.\nWe will be taking action in short order to follow the President\u2019s instruction to safeguard the deeply held religious beliefs of Americans who provide health insurance to their employees.\nSecretary Price will not be happy until he has been able to strip away all coverage for women\u2019s health issues. The man seems to have stepped out of the 18th century when women had no control over their bodies. He certainly would have been in favor of eugenics and the 1927 Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Bell that upheld a state\u2019s right to permit compulsory sterilization of women deemed unfit to bear children.\nIn addition to taking the ax to the contraception mandate, Price expressed glee over the House of Representative\u2019s vote to repeal the ACA.\nThe status quo is failing the American people. Premiums are skyrocketing; choices are narrowing or vanishing; and patients do not have access to the care they need. Today, the House of Representatives has begun to deliver on President Trump\u2019s promise to repeal a broken law and replace it with solutions that put patients in charge. This is a victory for the American people.\nThe American Health Care Act is focused on patients. It is the first step toward a patient-centered healthcare system that will provide Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage, empowering individuals and families to choose the coverage that best meets their needs, not what Washington forces them to buy, and equipping states to address the diverse needs of their most vulnerable populations. As Congress continues its work, the team at HHS will continue to support the reform effort by reviewing and initiating administrative actions to put patients, families and doctors in charge of medical decisions, bring down costs, and increase choices.\nThe American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed by the House allows states to file for waivers and allow health plans to exclude some or all of the essential health benefits under the current rulings. Price will almost certainly grant any waiver that strips women\u2019s health services from being offered in health plans. But his rational for allowing states to address \u201cthe diverse needs of their most vulnerable populations\u201d is fundamentally flawed. The Republicans have been promoting the idea that people in different states have different health care concerns. Therefore, states should be free to include or exclude certain services.\nThe health care needs of people are not dependent on what state you live in. A pregnant woman in Alabama requires the same pre-natal and other maternity health care services as a woman in California. The argument that somehow a person\u2019s health care needs change based on what state they live is tantamount to saying that people in Detroit should be fine with drinking lead-tainted water, but people in Texas shouldn\u2019t have to. All people should have access to clean drinking water because they are humans. All people should have access to the same health care services because they are humans regardless of what state they live in.\nThe other part of the AHCA is that it denies funding to Planned Parenthood. This means that women will have fewer providers to choose from if it passes the Senate and is signed by Trump. It has been Price\u2019s contention that the AHCA will expand access to care. But when the legislation removes hundreds of doctors who have been the primary care physician for thousands of women, how is that improving access to care?\nIt has become a tired phrase, but Price and his Republican-Christian-Conservative brethren put profits over people. Their ideas on the egalitarian nature of health care are that it should only be extended to healthy people who follow their holy scriptures. All others are unworthy of receiving affordable health insurance and decent health care. These people are just warped, stuck in their own little bubble world.",

    "text": "In fact, there are currently over a million international students studying in the United States. India and China are by far the two largest contributors, with 47% of all students for the 2015-2016 school year.\nThe visa application process can be confusing though, especially when English isn\u2019t your strong suit. We at TransparentCareer have laid out each type of visa used by international students, and the application process for each visa.\nF1 Visa\u2013 These are the most common type of visas, and are used for bachelor and graduate school degrees, as well as training programs in the English language. The first step is to check whether the university you\u2019re interested in is verified by the United States government \u2013 you can\u2019t get an F1 visa for non accredited universities. Take a look here to see if your school is verified. The first step is to apply to universities where you want to study. Upon acceptance, the university will provide you with a form I-20. Keep in mind \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer once you select a school. Make sure it\u2019s the right fit for you! You\u2019ll then have to go to the site of the US embassy closest to you, and pay a non refundable application fee. Find the embassy closest to you here.\nYou\u2019ll then have to prepare for an interview \u2013 the sooner you can set this up the better. The interviewer will require proof of intent to return to your country after you complete your education (such as family, home job offer) as well as a passport and the form I-20 provided by your school. The interview will also require proof of financial sufficiency to fund your education. If you need advice on how to finance your education, take a look at this guide. Depending on your school you may also have to provide test scores such as the SAT, GMAT, or GRE.\nJ1A Visa\u2013 J1A visas are for those looking to temporarily stay in the US for a work or culture exchange program, such as to be an au pair, international camp counselor, or for specific medical training. To be accepted, you have to be sponsored by a nonprofit or government organization. You can find a list of all approved organizations here. After applying and being approved by an organization, they\u2019ll provide you with a DS-2019 form to fill out. Then you have to apply for a J1A visa at your nearest US embassy. A Sevis I-901 fee must then be paid (sometimes by your sponsor), along with a Nonimmigrant Application Processing Fee of $160. You must then schedule an appointment with the embassy, giving plenty of time in case anything goes wrong. Bring along the DS-2019 form provided by your sponsor, as well as your passport, a 2\u00d72 photo, and any additional documentation that may be required depending on the nature of your program. You can find the types of documentation on the J1A government site.\nM1A Visa\u2013 This is visa for vocational training in the US. There must be a specific program/school when you apply for the visa, and you\u2019ll have certain requirements and forms you might have to fill out for the school before applying for a visa. You aren\u2019t allowed to work while studying in the US, so you must prove to the school that you have enough money to stay in the US while getting your training. If approved by the school, they\u2019ll give you a form I-20 to fill out, which you\u2019ll need next when you set up a meeting at your nearest US Embassy. You\u2019ll also have to pay an application fee, and bring your passport, a photo (with rules provided by your consulate), a DS-160 form, and a DS-157 form if you\u2019re a male between the ages of 16 and 45.\nH1B Visa- H1B work visas are for those that have completed a higher form of education and want to work in America \u2013 it\u2019s the most common way for foreign students to stay and work in the US after graduation. These visas have to be filed by your employer, so if you\u2019re hoping to stay in America after graduation you should start the job search as soon as possible. Approvals are done through a lottery system, and start to fill up quickly after the government\u2019s fiscal year starts \u2013 typically October 1. You may file up to 6 months in advance, so filing as close to April 1 as possible is ideal. There are a total of 85,000 visas issued this way each year, and the first 20,000 are reserved for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher levels of education. The remaining 65,000 are available to those with bachelor\u2019s degrees, along with those that didn\u2019t make it past the first round with a master\u2019s or higher level of education.\nA lot of controversy has stirred up around H1B visas recently after the election of Donald Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that he wants to get rid of people who got into the US unfairly. According to Forbes, the top 10 companies that sponsor H1B visas received 25,000 visas in 2014, which is nearly 30% of all issued H1B visas. Of these 10 firms, half were firms based in India, typically working with call centers. Trump and others supportive of a crackdown claim that firms are submitting multiple applications for one person in order to game the system. 236,000 applications were received last year for the 85,000 positions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there were 236,000 applicants. While we haven\u2019t seen what a Trump presidency will look like yet, stopping people from abusing the system may provide more opportunities for foreign students looking to work in the US after graduation.\nCheck out our industry career guides on Finance, Consulting, and Tech to help you decide which is the best fit for you.\nLooking to stay in the states after graduation? You\u2019ll need to get a great job first. TransparentCareer offers free data on career pathing, salary negotiation, and compensation. Sign up for free here.",

    "text": "Dayton WordCamp | The Jamestown Comet.\nSome people are of the mind that there is a certain age when learning something new is neither a priority nor even a possibility. As I approach a half-century on this earth, I have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that, at some point, people just stop learning.\nBarring some kind of dementia or other mental disorder, it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would \u201cchoose\u201d to be an old dog, totally uninterested in learning a new trick. In my lines of work, I am frequently exposed to innovative technology and new ideas and I\u2019m expected to keep up or I don\u2019t pay the mortgage.\nI spend a considerable amount of time researching, learning new concepts or updating my skills in some way so I can stay relevant in a world that seems to change by the nanosecond. Part of that continuing education includes reading, networking with others and going to conferences and workshops. I just returned from one such conference that was, for me, one of the single best I have ever attended.\nA couple of months ago, I was asked by a friend to speak at an upcoming technology event known as, \u201cDayton WordCamp,\u201d a two-day series focused on the website content management system called \u201cWordPress.\u201d As with most tech, this event would be dominated by much younger, more advanced presenters.\nOriginally, I hesitated, feeling as if \u201cat my age\u201d (and technical level) I would have little to bring to the table. But, with a little effort I found a spot where I fit into the program nicely and agreed.\nDayton\u2019s event is one of hundreds of WordCamps around the world, all presented for the benefit of those using WordPress as their website platform. Lovingly referred to by organizers as an \u201cunconference,\u201d the atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back, with most people wearing jeans and T-shirts. One of the perks of speaking is the opportunity to attend the event as a spectator as well.\nOne of the first things I noticed upon arrival was that I was not the oldest person in the room. Of roughly 120 attendees the bell curve probably favored the younger crowd, but there were plenty of people my age and older as well. Such diversity says something for both the reputations of the scheduled presenters and the usability of the software about which we had all come to learn.\nAs the first day\u2019s session began my apprehension diminished and I began to settle into a comfortable atmosphere for learning. By the conclusion of day two, I was not only charged up to dive in and apply my newly-acquired information, but I wanted to find a way to be more involved in future sessions.\nAt this point, I have to give a shout out to my friend Dustin Hartzler and his fellow organizers, particularly Nathan Driver, who invited me to speak at the event while also allowing me to be a student as well (that\u2019s not the norm at such functions). These folks gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge, allowing me to better serve my clients, plus I got to take a couple of days for myself, something for which I rarely have the opportunity.\nIn my experience, most people who have stopped learning have done so, in some manner, by choice. Learning is not just academic. Expanding your horizons at any age is not limited to taking college classes or immersing yourself in books for hours on end. You can attend free, hands-on workshops, watch \u201cdo it yourself\u201d shows on television, or just dive in and try something on your own, learning as you go.\nMy point is that there is simply no reason any of us should be stagnant. Opportunities for growth exist in many areas of our lives and all we need to do is take the first step. What is important is that you get out there and try, whether your interest is gardening, motorcycles, computers, music, or maybe you want to try something new. Don\u2019t be an old dog with no new tricks.\nGery L. Deer is an independent columnist and business writer. Deer In Headlines is distributed by GLD Enterprises Communications.",

    "text": "T he popular YouTuber Lilly Singh who is more prominent as Superwoman is genuinely making marks. Apart from all the social work and impressive collaborations, Lilly has now released a music video. Although nobody was quite expecting it from her, the rap song is definitely on fire. But what makes this song grab attention worldwide is that she brought into light what Bollywood songs would look like if they were turned into a woke rap.\nChoosing three songs from the industry, Superwoman gave them a whole new meaning and added her unique beats alongside it. Needless to say, this version highlights the blatant misogyny in the Bollywood music industry.\nThe internet just can not seem to get enough of Superwoman\u2019s empowering reinterpretation of their favorite Bollywood songs. The YouTuber released her own music video titled If Bollywood Songs Were Rap, with a compilation of three different hit songs. However, she added her own touch to it, and did not just translate the lyrics. There is much more to hear as Lilly has touched upon topics like unrealistic beauty standards of women, mental health issues, bisexuality and so much more.\nLilly Singh has chosen three hit songs including Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, All Izz Well and Aankh Marey. Apparently, her new rap version is everything that Bollywood never tells you about. Or everything that the entertainment industry gets wrong about women. Superwoman has smashed stereotypes with this new touch. Plus, she completely slayed the rap game.\nWhile sharing the song, Lilly claimed that she loves Bollywood and rap music. So, she decided to make an impact by turning her favorite ones into rap. But she wanted to do more so she added positive and empowering messages into them.\nLilly Singh aka Superwoman is a very popular YouTuber who has a massive following on the platform. She has ventured into various fields doing comic sketched, impressive collaborations including ones with Dwayne Johnson and Priyanka Chopra, and music videos. Apart from doing social work, she is now heading into Hollywood by getting her own late night show.",

Today, the U.S. government occupies much of the Newe Sogobia, using it as a domestic nuclear war zone. The Nevada Test Site was illegally seized from the tribe in the 1940s to use for nuclear weapons testing and as a dump for highly radioactive nuclear waste. Releases of radiation from the detonation of over 1000 nuclear weapons above and below the ground have resulted in cancer clusters and contamination in the communities downwind of the site \u2013 and beyond. Newe homelands have been turned into a National Sacrifice Area, or permanently poisoned lands. The latest threat to the Newe is the planned nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain located within the Nevada Test Site. The repository will accept over 75,000 tons of fuel rods and other high-level waste across roads and rails from 39 states and place it in a giant hole in the earth found to be seismically unstable and in contact with ground water. Plutonium, the most deadly man-made substance on earth, has a radioactive half-life of 250,000 years, and its nearby storage portends an unparalleled toxic peril for the next 12,000 generations living in the region.\nWherever Corbin Harney raises his voice, be it in song, in prayer, or in speech, be it at his homeland, at the UN, or in faraway Kazakhstan, his message is informed with the calm authority imbued him by the earth. In 1994, Corbin Harney founded the Shundahai Network (Shundahai is the Newe word for \u201cpeace and harmony with all creation\u201d), a non-profit organization dedicated to breaking the nuclear chain by building alliances with indigenous communities and environmental, peace and human rights movements. They seek to abolish all nuclear weapons and end all nuclear testing, advocate phasing out nuclear energy and ending the transportation and dumping of nuclear waste, and promote the principles of Environmental Justice. Their campaigns and events incorporate the values of community building, education, spiritual ceremonies and nonviolent direct action.\nI ask for moisture to fall upon us so the grass will start to grow.\nwhat we humans tramp down.\nwe tramp it down so it\u2019s flat on the ground.\ntogether we have to ask for the rain to come down, so the grass will continue to grow.\nCorbin Harney\u2019s spiritual strength has become a fountainhead of inspiration for environmental activists around the world. His solution to end the Nuclear Age: we must live in vital, spiritual connection with the earth!",

Thanks Francesca, you're amazing, I love them! thank you!\n\"I received the most beautiful gift today. And this little story of its arrival on my doorstep needs to be shared.\nA few months back I was travelling in country NSW in Australia and was scheduled to do an event on the last night of my stay. It was cold.\nSo I pulled myself together (like I do) to be of service and speak on all things food and nutrition to a small group of people. In the audience there was one shining light that stood out to me. She radiated so much light and we connected after I talked. She shared with an extremely vulnerable heart, her health concerns.\nAnd I offered my support in the coming weeks.\nWe connected every few days and I helped her see where she could improve. Our connection was in stolen moments and after she felt confident in the knowledge I had shared, I gave her space to absorb all that she\u2019d learnt to she could put all into practice.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, in the weeks following was that she had had such profound shifts.\nHer symptoms lifted, her energy returned, her ability to feel joy crept back into her life.\nYou see, when asked why do I coach, the answer is always the same.....to help people return to self. To feel joy again.\nToday, I received this beautiful gift, all the way from Milan. This beautiful human had this Pink Kunzite necklace made for me. I had truly made my day and I\u2019m so grateful. Who would have thought that a random act of service can create such immense love and joy for all.\"\n\"I don\u2019t know how I found Francesca but I am so glad I did. Lots of thought and love goes into everything she makes. It\u2019s not jewelry. It\u2019s so much more.\nyou work together to pick which kind of specimen to use.\nShe might know right away or you might know. Or you might have to decide between a few. But she works with the crystals and narrows it down.\nThen You pick from her collection which stone you feel drawn to. In my case, I let her tell me what I needed. She picked 6 pieces of Rubellite tourmaline.\nAnd then I picked the from that. It\u2019s absolutely perfect.\nAnd I got it the day if the new moon so it could not have worked out better.\nThank you so much Giardinoblu Jewellery Milan!!\"\n\"Working with Francesca was an absolute dream. I had been wanting to transform a beloved herkimer diamond into a pendant and, after purchasing several jewelry pieces from Francesca and seeing the level of care she puts into her work, I knew she was the only I would entrust my gemstone to.\nFrancesca loves gemstones and respects their energy, and that was very important to me when choosing someone.\nFrancesca made the whole creation process simple. She first shared some designs and, once I liked them, I sent her my stone via courier. Once she had it, she got to work, showing me every step of the way, and seeking my approval before moving forward.\nI loved how she kept me regularly informed of where we were in the process and listened to my observations. She was kind and courteous at every step of the way, and ended up creating a jewel I will treasure forever.\nI couldn't be happier with the necklace Francesca created for me. It's perfect in every way, and beams with positive energy.\"\nPhotographer, Stylist & Visual Strategist, Marcela Macias Photography.",

    "text": "The location of the July 15, 2002 flare is shown at left. The other panels compare the scale of Earth to the eruptions. Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. The results were presented last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society.",

    "text": "Was there recriticality at Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Plant?\nCriticality is a state in which nuclear fission reaction is occurring continuously in nuclear fuel. Nuclear fission generates a large amount of radiation and thermal energy. By artificially generating and controlling critical condition, nuclear power plants create thermal energy to produce electric power.\nIn the course of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, nuclear fuels inside the reactors of Unit 1 to 3 melted down and the debris is scattered at the bottom or outside below the reactor pressure vessels. In the accident, intense heat of the molten fuel melted the vessels and the fuel fell through the holes. Molten fuel solidified as abundant water was poured in and has been cooled by flowing water ever since.\nIs there any possibility that this molten fuel (fuel debris) will become critical again?\nTo judge this, measurement of \u201cradioactive noble gas\u201d such as Xenon plays a big role.\nRadioactive noble gas is an important indicator of the presence of criticality for it is created in fission reaction.\nGas discharged from the containment vessel which covers the pressure vessel is closely monitored by the \u201cgas management system.\u201d The system analyses the kind and amount of each component in real time.\nShould there were any recriticality, radiation level of radioactive noble gases would increase indicating the presence of the state of criticality. The radioactivity level of radioactive noble gas at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant so far has been maintained at a very low level that is incomparable to what was observed in the critical state of the accident.\nIt has never increased as to show critical signs up until now. This signifies the nuclear fuel once melted in the accident is kept in stable condition (maintained in subcritical state).\nTemperature of the now-defunct nuclear reactor in which molten nuclear fuel is cooled is also measured in real time. It is about the same as the outside temperature or a little colder (around 15 to 30 degrees).\nThis means heat accompanying criticality is not only generated but also the amount of heat emitted by the decay of radioactive materials is very small.\nAs a safety measure, equipments to inject boric acid water to halt the chain reaction of nuclear fission are installed in case re-criticality occurs.",

    "text": "Are you thinking about using online assignment help platforms? If you answered yes, then you are definitely not alone. This service is increasing in popularity across the globe. It makes it easier for students to handle their school requirements. But the nature of the service remains shrouded in controversy. After all, teachers and professors give out assignments for a reason. They are meant to boost the skills of students both inside and outside the classroom. This begs the question: Do assignment help services benefit or hurt students?\nIt\u2019s easy to see the benefits of hiring assignments experts to aid in your academic pursuits. They solve the problem of insufficient time to do homework\u2019s, especially if you take on multiple part-time jobs after school hours. As you know, writing essays or completing complicated assignments can take up a boatload of time. Between gathering information and adding the final touches, your assignment can take several hours to finish.\nThe speed with which you can finish your assignments with the help of service providers like the guys at Do My Assignments is another huge benefit. Most companies accept expedited requests for an extra fee. It\u2019s possible to get your paper or assignment in as little as 24 hours. While these aforementioned benefits are surely hard to resist, it\u2019s worth noting that using assignment writing services offers more than meets the eye.\nAt first, it might not appear to make sense that hiring assignment help providers can improve your research skills. You don\u2019t even need to research about anything. They will do everything for you, and this is where you can get tips from the experts.\nBy looking at the final output of the assignment expert, you could see how much it differs from the homework\u2019s you have done yourself. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if these differences are very noticeable. You could tell that time and effort has been dedicated to producing such a well-researched assignment. Even the references and links can help you with your future requirements, as you would see how much more credible your work will look like if the links aren\u2019t limited to Wikipedia.\nThe same applies to your presentation skills. The way the essay, research paper, or assignment is formatted can give you ideas on how to better structure your content. Notice how the ideas flow smoothly throughout, allowing you to get the point across even without the use of fancy words. You probably have a \u201cgo-to\u201d format for your essays, but you\u2019ll realize that it doesn\u2019t always work.\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss assignment writing services as only for lazy students who do not care at all about learning. But it\u2019s important to understand that the students can enjoy much more than its time-saving benefits. With the help of experts, you can pick up some tips on how to research about a topic, what credible sources to use, and how to present your ideas in a way that engages readers. All of these can prove beneficial for any student, even the ones who do remarkably well in class.",

    "text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.",

    "text": "I was brimming with excitement all of Thursday. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my date with Seabiscuit. I was very excited about his joining me at the theater plus the night adventures that would follow.\nI hurried home after work, took a quick shower, and headed out. It had been a warm day, and I was doubtful that I needed my jacket; however, then I remembered being cold at a previous performance in the evening. Even though I had checked the weather and saw Orinda was only predicted to be in the low 60s in the evening, I knew that up in the hills, where the theater is actually located, it can get much colder. I felt foolish carrying such a large jacket on BART and felt too warm to need it, but better safe than sorry.\nIt was good I did. By the time I arrived at the theater, it was significantly cooler. I was happy without a jacket but realized that once the sun finished setting, I would need to put it on. I waited for Seabiscuit to arrive, and was excited to see him clean-shaven\u2013as I had ordered as his Mistress. How good that he should obey so well! And he finally looked like one of his own photographs.\nI told him previously that he appeared to be a servant of the Many-Faced God because his face never seemed to match from one photograph to another. The angles were off or something seemed so strange about it. He didn\u2019t look like his photographs. I knew it was him, but how strange and different they all seemed.\nThere was a crowd, and I could tell he felt a bit shy. We hugged and kissed each other\u2019s cheeks, then held hands as we walked up the hill from Will Call to the theater.\nHe bought dinner for us at the caf\u00e9, and we continued holding hands. The line was long, and we really only had 10 minutes to eat before needing to be seated. He was impressed by my tickets and how close we were to the stage. The temperature had dropped significantly, so I put on my jacket when we were seated but he was astounded that I didn\u2019t close it until after intermission. I held his hand in his lap during the first half.\nDuring intermission, he rented a blanket while I used the restroom and got my free bag of Peet\u2019s coffee for renewing my subscription for the theater. We shared the blanket, and for the second half, he held my hand on my lap.\nThe performance was amazing, as all the shows I have seen there have been. CalShakes has done very well at selecting and directing plays that resonate with race issues going on currently, and this play was exceptionally well done in that regard. Seabiscuit enjoyed it greatly, and I told him he should return with me for all of next season. He said he would love to. It was his first time going to the theater in a very long time, and he said the final scenes with the bed on stage would linger in his memory for a long time.",

    "text": "Esther and Kenso fell in love with , and chose , the stunning Tuscany themed backdrop of Central Florida\u2019s Bella Collina Wedding Venue for their Central Florida April wedding and what a wedding it was! How can you possibly go wrong with a gorgeous bride, a handsome groom, and a beautiful venue?? This beautiful Haitian couple chose a classic contemporary and elegant theme for their Central Florida wedding. We have such a history with Esther\u2019s family ( We have already photographed 3 of her siblings weddings with 2 to go!) that Stan and I were really excited as well as nervous about capturing Esther and Kenso\u2019s Bella Collina Wedding just perfectly. Everything went smoothly with the talented team of Lynn Stuckas of Your Events by L & L who was in charge of coordinating Esther and Kenso\u2019s stunning Central Florida Bella Collina wedding. Esther\u2019s flowers were just beautifully done by Weddings by Carly Anes, and complimented her stunning mermaid dress from Demetrios Bridal. Her off white mermaid dress was heavily beaded, with lots of sparkle to compliment the dress, while the form fitting skirt enhanced and complimented Esther\u2019s perfect curves. The finishing touches were hair and makeup and beautifully done by LeJeune Artistry . The reception ballroom at Bella Collina was beautifully decorated with linens by Eli of Linen Creations, and D.J Geordany Jean Baptiste made sure that the music was a crowd pleaser, playing a well rounded selection of music from soca to hip hop to R & B. Of course we must include that Esther and Kenso\u2019s stunning Bella Collina Wedding was captured by S & S Photography and their beautiful video captured by Kelvin Aultman .\nBrandy and Dave met working aboard the Disney Fantasy Cruise ship in 2013. Brandy worked with the cruise staff team while Dave worked on the ship wide tech team. After nearly 4 years of sailing the seven seas with Mickey Mouse, the two lovebirds decided it was time to start a life together on land, in far away New Zealand. For Brandy\u2019s 28th birthday Dave surprised her with a fantastic trip to the Bay of Islands and Cape Reinga, the northern most point of New Zealand. It was here, overlooking the ocean, on the last day of their trip, that Dave got down on one knee and popped the question. Brandy of course said \u201cyes!\u201d and the excitement of planning their September 22 nd wedding began.\nWhen planning their wedding Brandy and Dave wanted a theme that reflected their life together thus far. They loved traveling, and decided to go with a vintage travel theme to match the grandeur feeling of the Ballroom at Church Street Station in downtown Orlando. Each table was themed around a different city in the world that they had visited together and of course they had to incorporate , at the head table no less, the Disney Fantasy Ship where they met. A \u201d Where in the world are you sitting? \u201d map directed guests to which city in the world they would be sitting and dining at. Party favors included a delicious candy station which included many different treats from the U.S , the U.K and New Zealand. A nice personal touch were the added photographs of each of their grandparents, on their wedding days ,which added the perfect vintage touch to their Ballroom at Church Street Wedding.\nSince Brandy and Dave are from two different countries the most important thing they wanted to make sure happened on their wedding day was getting their friends and families together, allowing everyone to get to know each other. Their guests came all the way to Orlando from Australia, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to celebrate with them, and celebrate they did with delicious food, lively dancing and drinking all night long until their fiery sparkler departure. Their Ballroom at Church Street Station Wedding was a huge success, that brought together 2 families, and 2 different cultures.\nAll wedding days are a blur but no one will forget the epic Maid of Honors \u201d rap speech \u201d nor the fun father/daughter mash up dance Brandy did with her dad. Dave\u2019s fondest memory was the tender and sweet dance with his grandmother to her favorite song. Congratulations Brandy and Dave, your wedding was great fun and S&S wishes you both many many years of happiness together!!\nI honestly can say that Madalyn was one of the most relaxed brides I\u2019ve ever encountered , lucky Aaron! When a bride \u201cgoes with the flow\u201d so to say the stress of the wedding is greatly reduced. If you have no theme other than choosing things you like how can you go wrong? Instead of having to find things that fall within your theme or \u201cgo with \u201d your theme you can simply find what works for you thus opening up all sorts of possibilities. Madalyn and Aaron chose Maison et Jardin for their beautiful April 1st Orlando wedding and it was refreshing and surprising to me how beautiful and elegant everything was for a bride who had no theme and no preconceived ideas about how her Central Florida wedding day should be.\nCongratulations to this wonderful and so in love couple, S & S Photography wishes you many years of health and happiness!!\nWe went with a personal friend to DJ our wedding. He knows our preferences in music and he was so eager to make us happy on our big day!\nWould you believe that Mike & Paige\u2019s parents and brother kept this proposed proposal secret for 3 WEEKS!! How her Mom kept that from her is beyond me, I would have burst from excitement! Paige and Mike eventually chose the beautiful Mission Inn Resort for their Orlando wedding. The day was rainy but nothing could dampen Paige and Mike\u2019s excitement! All the planning , all the details, all came together ( with considerable help from their talented planner Katie Jimenez, owner of Big Day Celebrations, Katie@BigDayCelebrations.com) and their Mission Inn Resort wedding was a true celebration of the joining of 2 lives and 2 families. Here we are 2 months later and these 2 wonderful people are now busy helping others. Paige is a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Mike works in Law Enforcement protecting and serving the citizens of Orlando.\nStan and I wish Paige and Mike a long, happy and healthy life together. These are 2 people that are thoughtful, kind, smart, gorgeous, and just plain NICE\u2026good people as they say, with wonderful families supporting them. Lots of love to them!!\nAdvice from the happy couple\u2026\u201d Always think about why your partner may be acting the way they are, whether they be happy, sad, mad,anxious etc. We find that this brings us peace and helps us to react in an appropriate way. We also encourage couples to \u201d not sweat the small stuff\u201d . Is it really worth your energy to bring up that annoying thing that happened last week ; the answer is usually no. When there are big issues, talk about them and again, think about why your partner is acting the way they are. If you know what may be causing them their sadness, anger, anxiousness only then can you move in a direction towards happiness! Great words of wisdom Mr & Mrs. Hamm!\nAlyssa and Bud\u2019s beautiful Venice wedding!\nBud and Alyssa first met at a Chilies restaurant in 2013 after initially meeting on line via \u201cChemistry.com\u201d. Clarence, AKA Bud, worked the night shift as an Orlando Police Officer and Alyssa, as she says,\u201dbeing surrounded by engineers limited our dating scene so we both turned to online dating and it all turned out for the best!\u201d Bud said that,\u201d they talked for hours, about everything from work to zip lining, and unbeknownst to them, began laying the foundation of what would become a wonderful and lasting relationship.\u201d Bud\u2019s proposal began with an invitation to dinner and a movie, after which they headed for their favorite local spot, Cranes Roost. \u201d It\u2019s where we first became officially boyfriend and girlfriend, and had our first kiss.\u201d Bud even had a photographer there who, under the false pretense of \u201cpracticing\u201d on them, proceeded to take their picture. Alyssa went along and agreed to \u201d have some stranger take our photo\u201d Bud, after the first photo, got down on his knee and proposed! She said YES and now here they are, happily married newlyweds in 2016.\nAugust 6 th was the big day and Bud and Alyssa agreed that they wanted an outdoor themed wedding, without the outdoors\u2026\u201d Too hot for a Florida August outdoor wedding\u201d said Alyssa. They chose the beautiful Plantation in Venice, a spot on the East coast close to where Alyssa grew up. One thing Alyssa knew for certain was that she wanted a cookie table at the reception. \u201d I was raised by my Mom and always grew up close to her, she was the one there through thick or thin. My Dad lived in NY so when I visited him he would make sure we had our time together by waking me up in the middle of the night and we would have Oreos and milk\u201d How super sweet..pun intended!\nEverything came together beautifully on their wedding day in large part due to Alyssa being a very hands on and involved bride. \u201cEverything was set up and made by myself or one of my amazing bridesmaids- from the homemade jams and the signs to the center pieces and the kids table!\u201d Apart from a tiny thunderstorm that blew through as the ceremony was about to start the wedding was a success\u2026lively & full of dancing and laughter, which ended with an exciting ecofetti departure. Alyssa and Bud Stan and I wish you two lovebirds a long, safe and prosperous life together and want to thank you for inviting S & S to be a part of such a momentous occasion in your lives!\nAfter 7 years of dating Chris unexpectedly proposed to Pam in June of 2015 at a Styx concert! \u201cWe had seen them twice before and were super excited to be able to go again. The show was incredible and we had a great hotel which we ended up at after the concert. Our room had a view overlooking a river and he suggested we take a walk along the boardwalk. I was a little curious since it was an odd time of night to go (around 11:30pm I think) but it was beautiful. We walked onto the bridge over the river and joked about how many spiders there were (I am afraid of them of course). He told me how much he loved me and promised he always would then asked if I would do the same and when I said yes he pulled out the ring. I promptly dropped the water bottle that I was holding onto his foot, I was so surprised! But we laughed and I practically screamed yes and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d Pam\u2019s Mother had purchased a dress for her to wear at her prom many years ago at the Goodwill store in her high school home town of Lockhart , for $14.00. She ended up not being able to go to her Senior Prom and the dress stayed with her as she moved and relocated 3 times\u2026.she loved her dress too much to part with. No occasion seemed worthy of it, until Chris proposed\u2026\u201dAfter Christopher and I got engaged I had no doubt that I would wear my long lost dress, it was perfect. The theme, flowers and decor all fell into place after that! \u201d Stan and I loved Pam\u2019s entire look\u2026from her dress to her beautiful summer flowers in her hair, the inspiration coming from her childhood\u2026\u201dMy mother wore a flower crown for her wedding and I remembered how much I loved playing with it when I was younger. I thought about buying a crown online but the cost was way higher than I expected and the colors were good but not perfect. It took many trips to a handful of craft stores but I was able to find the flowers that I really wanted and after reading some DIY articles I decided to make my own crown. All in all it cost around $35 (for the stuff I actually used) and took about 18 total hours.\u201d The guest list for their intimate July 31st wedding was short..her parents, his parents , his sister and boyfriend and a favorite Aunt\u2026\u201dOur parents, my aunt, and Christopher\u2019s sister and her boyfriend have truly been our support system and very best of friends over the last 5 years which made them the most important people to have with us on our wedding day.\u201d The ceremony was in a beautiful park tucked away in a Longwood neighborhood, with dinner at Lake Mary\u2019s FishBones.Congratulations to a sweet, unique and beautiful couple!!\nKarla & Steven Bayes chose one of Orlando\u2019s premier wedding locations for their beautiful March wedding\u2026yes we are late posting this but better late than never! Orlando\u2019s ChampionsGate Resort is a gorgeous Central Florida location perfectly suited to hosting Central Florida weddings. This venue is beautifully decorated, especially the courtyard and ballrooms. The accommodations are luxurious , the cuisine exceptional and the service superb. S & S Photography enjoyed working with a talented , organized and detail oriented co-ordinator and her team, Xiomarra Sanchez, owner of A Nite To Remember Events. ( Niteevents.com) Xiomarra and her team ensured that every detail, every desire, every element and every aspect of the wedding day was meticulously addressed , handled and taken care of immediately,for the bride and groom. When I asked Xiomarra why Steven and Karla chose S & S Photography for their Central Florida wedding photography needs she answered\u2026\u201dS & S was a no brainer when picking a wedding photographer for Karla and Steven. Charlene and Stan were the photographers for Karla\u2019s Mothers wedding a few years back and they LOVED them! Working with S & S is EASY and a PLEASURE. I LOVE Charlene\u2019s energy. The pictures speak for themselves. EXCELLENT photography and an EXCELLENT company\u201d. We always look forward to working with A Nite To Remember Events and we look forward to the change in photography needs of Karla and Steven\u2026from being their wedding photographers to, one day, becoming their FAMILY photographers!\nIt was so wonderful to be the wedding photographers for a couple that truly compliments each other and are so in love with each other! Heather and Todd\u2019s Bella Collina wedding was absolutely wonderful and touching beyond words, just perfect. Their outdoor traditional wedding ceremony on the lawn at Bella Collina was romantic and emotional\u2026watching Todd try to stay composed while Heather walked towards him on her Dad\u2019s arm had me tearing up! After the ceremony we had so much fun taking their wedding pictures\u2026under the Bell Tower, down by the bridge\u2026we\u2019re always able to find great locations for wedding pictures at the Tuscan themed Bella Collina. The evening was filled with joy and laughter and everyone there had an amazing time celebrating the union of two amazing people!",

No, not the serious one that HBO is doing with Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti, and not the overtly comedic one that Will Ferrell is set to star in. It\u2019s Battle Of The Sexes, the middle one that\u2019s supposed to be a comedy with \u201cdramatic and political overtones\u201d\u2014as we said in an earlier report. Battle Of The Sexes comes from Little Miss Sunshine\u2019s Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and it was set to star Emma Stone and Steve Carell as the eponymous sexes. Now, Stone has backed out due to \u201ca scheduling conflict,\u201d and the studio is reportedly in talks with Brie Larson to replace her.\nLarson recently appeared in Room, a film that is not only making some waves in the film festival circuit but also has a name that\u2019s very similar to a certain other movie, which could end up causing a reverse-Asylum by tricking people who want to see a bad movie into seeing a good movie.

    "text": "According to the study targeted on a group of 38 adult cats, which has lasted for four years, cats eat more food in the season of winter therefore, their owners should provide the pets with cat-food during this period of time.\nIn order to find the new way to enhance milk production, seasonal food intake by dairy cows has been tested in the past. However, this study involved in domestic cats is the largest of its kind so far.\nThe group of 38 cats coming from mixed breeds, ages and genders were kept at a center in France, where they were free to do whatever they preferred outdoors all year round.\nWith a microchip on their collar, the cats were able to get as much food as they needed from a dispenser, which would be opened just the group of cats. Simultaneously, such microchip could make a record how much food the cat had taken and when it did.\nAs Dr Alex German from the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, explained in the paper paper published in the latest edition of PLoS ONE, like many humans, cats are likely to have comfort eating in the cold weather outside.\nHowever, from their study, Dr Alex German and his team found the main reason for that is the extra energy cats needed to maintain warmness when they were outside for outdoor activities. In addition, Dr German\u2019s team also confirmed that cats ate about 15 per cent less food during summer.\nIn his conclusion, Dr Alex German stated that the swing in activity levels during the year might be closely linked with the extra effort to maintain warmness in winter and the temptation to rest during hot days in summer.\nSo it is suggested that the amount of food the cats take at different times of year should carefully considered by their keepers, because it is important to allow cats to have a healthy weight.\nHey Puppy, Please Get Along with That Kitty!",

    "text": "3rd March 2015 - A new UN report on the global drug situation has highlighted the widening rift between countries on the issue of the death penalty for drug offences. These tensions are set to surface as Member States convene in Vienna next week at the annual meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the UN policy making body on drug control issues.\nThe Annual Report of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), released today, calls upon States that \u2018continue to impose the death penalty for drug-related offences to consider abolishing the death penalty for such offences\u2019.\nThe statement comes just a week before the annual meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the UN policy making body on drug control issues, and underscores an issue that has become increasingly volatile among members of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in recent years. Indeed, attempts to craft a joint resolution on drugs at last year\u2019s meeting nearly fell apart amidst heated debates between Member States on including language against the death penalty.\nThe death penalty for drugs looks to again be a major point of contention at the 2015 Commission meeting next week. A recent spate of executions in Indonesia has turned the world\u2019s attention to the practice, with the killings of Dutch and Brazilian nationals prompting those governments to recall their Ambassadors from Jakarta. It remains to be seen how these diplomatic tensions will influence the States\u2019 relations during the Commission meeting.\nBut it is not just Indonesia\u2019s actions that are bringing these tensions to the fore. A number of other countries have demonstrated a renewed enthusiasm for executing drug offenders over the past year: Iran has escalated drug related hangings, Pakistan has resumed executions and Oman has proposed to introduce capital punishment for drug crimes. A protest to end the use of the death penalty for drugs will take place outside UN headquarters in Vienna during the Commission meeting.\nThe statement from the INCB -- a body of independent experts that monitors the implementation of the international drug control treaties -- reinforces a similar call the group made one year ago, which added its voice to those of other UN authorities, including the Secretary-General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), who have called for ending the death penalty for drug offences.\nIronically, although the UNODC has publicly spoken out against the death penalty for drug offences, the agency has been linked to funding aggressive anti-trafficking operations in several death penalty States, and a number of donor governments have publicly acknowledged the link between UNODC counter-narcotics funding and death sentences. In recent years the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland all resolved to end funding UNODC programmes in certain countries while the death penalty is still enforced.\n\u201cThe death penalty for drug offences represents the sharp end of the world\u2019s failed war on drugs, disproportionately punishing the vulnerable while failing to tackle entrenched forces of crime and corruption. We welcome the growing number of UN bodies willing to condemn this unjust and ineffective punishment, but these positive sentiments must be backed by effective action if we are to stem the rising tide of states seeking to put drug offenders to death.\nA side event organised during the Commission meeting by the NGOs Reprieve, Harm Reduction International and the International Drug Policy Consortium will specifically examine links between international and UN aid and death sentences and executions for drug offences.",

    "text": "An example method involves providing, with a network management module of a network management system, current reroute statistics in a data structure based on the rerouting of the data from a logical circuit that has failed to a logical failover circuit in the network. The current reroute statistics include a committed information rate corresponding to the logical circuit in the network. The logical circuit is identified by a first logical circuit identifier. The logical failover circuit is identified by a second logical circuit identifier. The first and second logical circuit identifiers are renamed until the logical circuit has been restored from failure. Updated reroute statistics are provided, with the network management module, based on a change in a status of the logical circuit resulting from the committed information rate having been exceeded.\nThis patent arises from a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 7,460,468, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\nThis patent is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/348,077, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Obtaining Logical Performance Data for a Circuit in a Data Network,\u201d filed Jan. 21, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 10/744,921, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Rerouting Logical Circuit Data In A Data Network,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003. All of the above-referenced applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\nPeriodically, failures may occur to the trunk circuits or the NNIs of network circuits in large-scale networks causing lost data. Currently, such network circuit failures are handled by dispatching technicians on each end of the network circuit (i.e., in each LATA) in response to a reported failure. The technicians manually access a logical element module to troubleshoot the logical circuit portion of the network circuit. The logical element module communicates with the switches in the data network and provides the technician with the status of the logical connections which make up the logical circuit. Once the technician determines the status of a logical connection at one end of a logical circuit (e.g., the host end), the technician then must access a network database to determine the location of the other end of the logical circuit so that its status may also be ascertained. If the technician determines the logical circuit is operating properly, the technician then accesses a physical element module to troubleshoot the physical circuit portion of the network circuit to determine the cause of the failure and then repair it. If, while troubleshooting a network circuit, the technician determines that a network circuit will be \u201cdown\u201d (i.e., losing data) for an extended time period, the technician may manually reroute the data from a failed network circuit to an available unused or \u201cbackup\u201d network circuit while the failed network circuit is being repaired.\nAs discussed briefly above, the network management module 176 may be configured to automatically reroute logical circuit data from a failed logical circuit to a logical failover circuit in the data network 2. During the reroute of logical circuit data, the network management module 176 may also be configured to rename the logical circuit identifier assigned to a failed logical circuit to the logical circuit identifier assigned to a corresponding logical failover circuit until the failed logical circuit has been restored. An illustrative method detailing the renaming of logical circuit identifiers is presented in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,047, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Renaming Logical Circuit Identifiers For Rerouted Logical Circuits In A Data Network,\u201d filed on Dec. 23, 2003, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\nThe logical operations 500 continue from operation 505 to operation 510 where the network management module 176 generates a table for presenting the current reroute statistics generated at operation 505. It will be appreciated that the table may be presented in an electronic format so that it is graphically displayed on one or more display terminals of the network management module 176. FIG. 6A is a table presenting current reroute statistics which may be generated for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. The table will be discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 6A below.\nAt operation 525, the network management module 176 generates updated reroute statistics based on the received updated trap data and then updates the table (generated at operation 510) at operation 530. FIG. 6B is a table presenting updated reroute statistics which may be generated for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. The table will be discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 6B below. The logical operations 500 then continue at operation 535.\nFIG. 6A is a table 190 presenting current reroute statistics which may be generated by the network management module 176 for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG. 6A, the table includes a LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52, a REROUTE STATUS column 54, a LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56, a # HOPS column 58, a UTILIZATION column 60, a QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) column 62, and a REROUTE PERIOD column 64. The LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 lists the logical circuit IDs for logical circuits belonging to one or more network circuit customers in the data network 2. The REROUTE STATUS column 54 lists whether or not each of the logical circuits in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 is currently being rerouted. The LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56 lists the logical circuit IDs for logical failover circuits which may be utilized for rerouting data from the logical circuits listed in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52. The # HOPS column 58 lists the number of hops taken by data being communicated through the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56. The UTILIZATION column 60 lists the utilization percentage of the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56 by rerouted logical circuit data. The QoS column 62 lists the quality of service offered for rerouted data by each of the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56. The REROUTE PERIOD column 64 lists the amount of time the data from each of the logical circuits identified in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 has been rerouted to the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56.\nproviding, with the network management module, updated reroute statistics based on a change in a status of the logical circuit resulting from the committed information rate having been exceeded.\n2.

    "text": "Every sport brings its own requirements for eyewear, including winter sports. Simon Briggs from Extreme-Eyewear, a specialist sports eyewear company, explains what the main issues are when choosing the right eyewear for your sport.\n\u201cSports eyewear requirements can be broken down into two main areas, eyewear fit and eyewear lenses.\n\u201cA sports person's eyewear needs to fit securely and comfortably, ensuring optimal performance in any situation. Each sport has its own requirements for sport sunglasses/eyewear. Many sports are played all year round so its important to have a sunglass lens in your sport sunglasses that will cope with a wide variety of sunlight conditions (from low light to heavy sunshine) or to have interchangeable lenses.\n\u201cSome sports are played on reflective surfaces such as water or snow where it is beneficial to have polarised lenses in your sport sunglasses to reduce the sun glare.\n\"The most popular correction comes in the form of an optical insert which is fitted with your prescription. The insert clips onto the back of the sport sunglasses enabling you to still interchange the \u2018main sunglass\u2019 lenses for different colours. As the insert can be removed this concept is also great for contact lens wearers.\"\n\"Cosmetically you can often tell there is an insert behind the sunglasses which makes them less than perfect for fashion prescription sunglasses but their functionality makes them idea for sport.\"\n\"The second form of correction is 'direct glazed' lenses, where your prescription is fitted into the eyewear frame. Two brands that excel are Oakley and Maui Jim, both manufacturing wrap-around lenses tailored to your prescription.\n\"Getting your ski goggles right is essential, when skiing or snowboarding a goggle has to be able to deliver good peripheral view, air circulation (to combat fogging), comfort and due to the popularity of helmets now be \u2018helmet compatible\u2019.\n\"There are a number of different sunglass and goggle hybrids available. These clever pieces of kit mean that you can buy your sunglasses and goggles at once. You simply buy a pair of sunglasses with sides that can be clicked off of the frame and replaced with a headband for a more secure fit.\n\"Some of these models include a padding system, which gives a more comfortable fit when worn as a goggle. The padding simply clicks into place on the back of the sunglass, and turns the sunglass into a full goggle.\"\n\"The prescription part of the correction is in the form of an optical insert that sits inside the skiing goggle, behind the main lens. The optical insert has no contact with your face making a perfect fit and allowing the goggle to fit as intended by the manufacturer.\nAre There Alternative Corrections Available?\"An alternative to optical inserts is to purchase 'Over the glass' ski goggles. These goggles are specifically designed to sit over the top of prescription glasses, having increased ventilation and a wide fit enabling your glasses to comfortably sit underneath.\"",

    "text": "This past summer a pregnant woman was punched in the face while walking along a street in Brooklyn. She was knocked out, but, fortunately, no lasting harm came to her or to her baby. The assailant, a 33-year old man, was quickly apprehended in what seems to be a completely random act of violence.\nNo question that the attack was terrible, but is the neighbor\u2019s conclusion accurate? Should we \u2013 all of us \u2013 fear everyone? I guess, on the one hand, that we might be safer if we do: if we assume that every person, in every situation is trying to hurt us for no reason at all, we will always act to protect ourselves. We will never approach a stranger to say hello or ask if they need help; we will never even smile at them as they walk by. We will always lock our doors, our windows, our cars, and we will always ask ourselves if we are leaving ourselves open to attack \u2013 on the street, at work or school, on the bus or train, at the mall, in the park\u2026 but is that how we want to live?\nYears ago, before 9/11, I gave a sermon in which I asked how many people at that Yom Kippur service knew anyone personally who had been murdered. Out of 900 people in the room, four raised their hands. Now I ask you the same question: with the exception of the vile, calculated attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, how many friends, relatives or acquaintances of yours have been murdered, or even suffered serious injury, at the hand of a stranger?\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this before realizing that the answer, for me, is exactly zero. A relative died in World War II, and a college roommate was killed by a rival for his girlfriend\u2019s affections, but not a single friend, relative or acquaintance of mine has been murdered or seriously hurt by a stranger. When I consider how many thousands of people I have known over the course of my life, that\u2019s seems pretty amazing.\nBut is it so amazing? If we listen to the news it sounds like people are being punched in the face every day, on every street corner. However, if we remember that over 8 million people live in New York City, and another 8 \u00bd million live in New Jersey, then our chances of being punched by a random stranger on one day in August seem to be around 16,500,000 to one. And since it hasn\u2019t happened again since that day, the chances are hundreds of millions to one. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the news.\nThe job of any news organization is not, actually, to give us the news; it is to make us watch or listen or click or read, so they can sell whatever it is they sell to stay in business. Our job is to ask ourselves whether the reports of random violence are relevant to us and whether we should adjust our lives in response. If someone told me that a knife-wielding lunatic was seen in my development, you can be sure I would bolt the doors. But hearing that a man in Brooklyn punched a pregnant woman, despicable as it was, does not lead me to the conclusion that I \u201chave to be afraid of everyone.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even mean that every person in Brooklyn has to be afraid of everyone.\nFrom the TSA farce at airports to security cameras monitoring cars at Freehold Raceway Mall, we are told to be afraid all day, every day. News reports make it sound like we are lucky to get through a single day without harm. But our life experiences do not bear this out.\nYes, bad things happen in life. But far, far fewer than we imagine. The news has its place and purpose, but we should not let it define our lives for us.\n\u201cFear everyone\u201d is a terrible motto to live by. We deserve better.",

    "text": "Although the official language of Jamaica is Standard English, many Jamaicans also speak Patois which is a separate dialect/language. Jamaican Patois (also known as \u201cPatwa\u201d, \u201cPatwah\u201d or \u201cJamaican Creole\u201d) is the language that is used by most Jamaicans in casual everyday conversations while Standard English is normally reserved for professional environments.\n\"Jamaican Patois is a separate language from Jamaican English.\"\nJamaican Patois is a strange language in that it has many borrowed words from many different languages, for example, English, Spanish and some West African languages. However, the pronunciations of these words are very similar to Jamaican English. One thing to keep in mind as you learn Jamaican Patois is that it is not a strict, rule-oriented language where there is a \"right way\" and a \"wrong way\" to say things. Some words can be pronounced and spelled differently but still mean the same thing (e.g. both \u2018Pickney\u2019 and \u2018Pickeney\u2019 translates to \u2018Child'). The important thing is whether or not what you are saying can be understood.\nIt's actually quite difficult to acquire the accent of a Jamaican, unless you've lived in Jamaica for many years, and even then, speaking patois fluently is not guaranteed. But with a little practice, you will be able to have at least a basic understanding of Jamaican Patois.\nLet us now take a look at some of the grammatical features of Jamaican Patois.\nSentences in Jamaican Patois are built like English sentences in that, there is a subject, a predicate (or verb), and an object. However, there is no subject-verb agreement in Jamaican Patois. The verb does not change with the subject. Let us look at the table below.\nHowever, in Jamaican Patois a word can be pluralized by adding 'dem' to the end word or, inserting 'nuff' or a number at the beginning of the word.\nThere is no differentiation in the use of pronouns to show gender. The pronoun 'im' can mean both or either 'he' or 'she'.\nThere is no distinction between subject and object.\nThe copula is a connecting word; for example, in Jamaican Patois the copula is the letter 'a' which is used for the particle as well as for the continuous tense.\nIn Standard English it is never acceptable to use double negatives such as 'nobody does not'. However, in\u2022 Jamaican Patois double negatives are accepted.\nBy now you probably have a basic understanding on the differences between Jamaican Patois and Standard English, for a more detailed guide, you can check out our how to speak Jamaican Patois series.",

    "text": "Hours after a lower court here sentenced him to five years in jail for a hit and run accident that killed one man in 2002, Bollywood actor Salman Khan was granted interim bail for two days by the Bombay High Court on Wednesday.\nSalman\u2019s counsel had moved the High Court for bail immediately after the sessions sentenced him to five years in prison in the case.\nThe bail means Salman will stay out of the Arthur Road jail for at least the next two days.\nEarlier in the day, Additional Sessions Judge D.W. Deshpande had announced the verdict against Salman at a packed court here.\nThe quantum of sentence follows the court holding Salman guilty in the case and arguments between the prosecution team led by special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat and the defence team led by Shrikant Shivade on the quantum of sentence.\nJudge Deshpande found Salman guilty of most of the charges in the September 2002 accident in which one person was killed and four injured.\nEarlier Wednesday, a scuffle erupted between Mumbai police personnel and some members of the large media contingent outside the court complex, as the latter were prevented from entering the premises.\nHeated arguments between the agitated media personnel and police finally saw the security shutting the doors of the sessions court No.52 where arguments between the prosecution and defence lawyers were underway before Judge Deshpande.\nThough officials remained tight-lipped, soon after sentencing Salman is likely to be taken into police custody and lodged in a high security prison.\nEarlier reports said the judge would pronounce the sentence on Thursday.\nAdditional Sessions Judge D.W. Deshpande reading out his judgment said \u201cAll charges have been proved against the actor\u201c.\n\u201cYou were driving the car, without a licence and you were under the influence of alcohol,\u201d the judge told Salman, who was present in the court.\nThe actor had earlier denied the charges and told the court that he was not driving the car. But the court rejected that statement.\nOn September 28, 2002, Salman\u2019s vehicle Toyoto Land Cruiser rammed into a roadside bakery in Bandra West, close to his seafront home in Galaxy Apartments. Four persons sleeping on the pavement outside the bakery were injured. One of them later died.\nSalman was arrested the same day by the Bandra police and given bail by a Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate\u2019s court.",

    "text": "The return of Morning Style!\nMany of you have been asking me whether my regular fashion show, Morning Style, will be returning to QVC. The good news is YES!\nWednesday 1st July is the day, in its usual slot at 10am. It will continue right though the summer until the end of September; I\u2019m really looking forward to bringing you a selection of outfits from a variety of brands and helping you get the best out of QVC fashion again.\nOne thing that is important, whatever your style, is getting the basics right. That can mean choosing underwear that helps rather than hinders the finished look. There\u2019s a reason the old fashioned term for these clothes is foundation garments \u2013 get it wrong and your entire look can be undermined, but with the right shape wear underneath you can look better than ever.\nChoosing shapewear is notoriously difficult \u2013 getting the correct size, shape and style can sometimes seem little better than guesswork, so we\u2019ve decided to bring you a new show to help you make the right decisions.\nYour Figure Solutions will be launched on Wednesday 27th May at midday. Not all the clothes are underwear as we\u2019ll be featuring a variety of pieces. The show will feature innovative solutions to some of your swimwear problems, leggings that smooth and sculpt, and possibly the most comfortable bra ever!\nIf you\u2019re thinking about a holiday you have planned, and how you don\u2019t feel quite as confident as you\u2019d like by the pool or on the beach, you should tune in to hear about how Fit 4 u\u2019s swimwear deals with body concern areas \u2013 usually bust, tummy, hips, bottom or thighs \u2013 or all of the above!! An empire-line swim dress is one of the piece that\u2019ll be featuring.\nRhonda Shear\u2019s Ahh Bra will also feature \u2013 a fabulous pack of six in three neutral colours for under \u00a350. It has great reviews on our website.\nA name you may have heard as they\u2019ve been with QVC for years is Slim \u2018n Lift. They make some great control wear that can help you lose inches from your chosen area. It\u2019s a temporary loss, of course, but what I always find amazing is that the extra flesh doesn\u2019t pop out anywhere else \u2013 it seems to be compressed by the garment, rather than just squeezed elsewhere, which gives the bonus of feeling firmer too. But it\u2019s not just about underwear \u2013 we also have a funky pair of shaping leggings in snake or animal print which I\u2019m hoping to wear on the day, but you\u2019ll need to tune in to see them.\nWe will be kicking off the show with a relatively new name to QVC and that\u2019s skinnytees. This is a classic vest top that feels fantastic to wear. It\u2019s made from a soft stretchy fabric and is seamless and long enough to wear over leggings. When I took part in the charity Moonwalk with TeamQVC last weekend I wore it under my decorated bra (they prefer us to wear just the bra but my tummy is not fit for public viewing!) and it was the prefect choice. Comfy and with a smoothing effect too. Here\u2019s a photo of us all before we started the walk.\nI think controlwear or shapewear can be tricky to get right. It can be uncomfortable, ride up or down, make you feel too hot or simply not do the job you want. You can choose a high level of control or something that just smooths your silhouette; something to hide under your outer garments or to show off as part of your outfit. There\u2019s so much choice, where to start?\nIf you have any questions or concerns about what sort of shapewear is right for you and your particular issue or aim, do please drop me a quick line as a comment below or on Twitter (@kathytaylerqvc). I will be welcoming several guests to the new show and I will put your questions or problems to them and hopefully they will have some answers for you that may help many of us.\nI do hope you can join us \u2013 midday on Wednesday 27th May. See you then!\nGreat to see the Morning Style show is coming back!! Looking forward to the shapewear shows, as you say get the underwear right and the outfit wil look great too. I love the spanx range and also vicela Vita.\nI will be tuning in for both morning style and the shapewear show!I Find shapewear shopping tricky. I what something that will smooth out my lumps and bumps but but I don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable after half an hour ! Any suggestions Kathy!\nHi Jilly. Good to hear from you. We won\u2019t be featuring Vercella Vita or Spanx in tomorrow\u2019s show but I think you might like some of what we have lined up. Hope you can join us!\nHi Susan. How are you?! Thanks for the youthful comment \u2013 I certainly didn\u2019t feel it at the end of the might, but the hat helped keep me warm!\nThanks for your comment. I agree with you \u2013 I can be desperate to get out of some control wear however good it makes me look. We will be address the balance between compression, smoothing and comfort tomorrow so I do hope you\u2019ll join is. Hopefully we can help you choose something suitable for you.\nGood news re Morning Style!\nThe skinny tees are brilliant. I have them in all the colours including the new 4! What I really love about them is that stop trousers etc that are a little loose slipping. They are much more comfortable than wearing a belt! Can we please have more of the dark colours \u2013 I love them all but the white ones are pretty unforgiving with nothing else on even if you are slim! But the dark ones are extra good.\nAlso, more of the vercella vita crop tops. There must be a really strong demand as they always sell out within minutes of going to air, and they are rarely put up before the show ( presumably as they would sell out too quickly!) There are loads of longer vest tops but no crop tops online almost all the time. Doesn\u2019t that say that you need to get more of them!! Especially in the summer.",

    "text": "How long does it take the flu to evade a vaccine?\nWith all the recent Presidential attention to the threat from the H5N1 Avian Flu, and the many billions now earmarked for stockpiling vaccines and drugs, it seems like a good idea to ask on what time scale the virus might be able to evade these countermeasures. Vaccination is of particular interest, as it is regarded as by far the best tool to combat viral infection at the population level.\nGenomic analyses of H5N1 isolates from birds and humans showed 2 distinct clades with a nonoverlapping geographic distribution. All the viral genes were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses.\nGenetic and antigenic analyses have shown that, compared to previous H5N1 isolates, 2004-2005 isolates share several amino acid changes that modulate antigenicity and perhaps other biological function. Furthermore, our molecular analysis of the HA from isolates collected in 2005 suggests that several amino acids located near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which may affect antigenicity or transmisibility.\nDespite the recent \"Isolation of drug-resistant H5N1 virus,\" (Nature, 20 October 2005), the WHO Global Influenza team determined that recent isolates are \"sensitive to 2 neuraminidase inhibitors that are recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention against human infections.\" So obviously the specific details of which viral isolate one is working with determine its sensitivity to drugs. In the case of the drug-resistant strain, it was isolated in February 2005 from a Vietnamese girl who may have contracted the virus while she cared for her brother. Human-to-human transmission is supported by the girl's lack of contact with poultry and the fact that the neuraminidase gene from virus isolated from the girl was virtually identical to that isolated from her brother. Thus there are evidently drug resistant strains running around in the wild.\nAs far as I can tell, it just isn't yet clear how fast drug-resistance traits can spread. There is now at least a little data about how long it takes a particular viral strain to find work-arounds for vaccines. A recent initial effort to sequence many flu strains in parallel indicates that mutations that provide ways around vaccines can rapidly dominate a population of flu viruses.\nPerhaps the most dramatic finding in our data is the discovery of an epidemiologically significant reassortment that explains the appearance, during the 2003-2004 season, of the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like strain, for which the existing vaccine had limited effectiveness. ...Phylogenetic analysis of 156 H3N2 genomes from our project revealed the clear presence of multiple, distinct clades circulating in the population. Through a reassortment event, a minor clade provided the haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain after the 2002-2003 season.\nThis finding illustrates not only that the influenza virus population contains multiple lineages at any given time, but also that alternate, minor lineages can contribute genetic variation to the dominant lineage, resulting in epidemiologically significant, antigenically novel strains. It is worth emphasizing that our sequence-based sampling approach--in contrast to traditional serologically based sampling--will reveal co-circulating strains even before they become antigenically novel.\nIn other words, the authors assert that amongst viruses that we give the same name there is considerable variation that may be hard to distinguish using traditional techniques. Sequencing the genomes of many isolates can provide a map of how a population of viruses is changing in response to vaccines. Ghedin, et al., note that their work demonstrates significant change of the dominant flu strain even within the 2003-2004 flu season. That variation appeared to originate and then dominate the population of viruses within 12 months.\nWhich brings me to the core of this post, namely that we now have real-world data demonstrating that flu viruses can escape vaccines in less than a year, far shorter than the time it takes to produce significant quantities of effective vaccines. It is important to note that this is a different problem than producing a new vaccine for new annual flu strains every year. If a pandemic strain emerges, our problem is not planning ahead just far enough to deploy a vaccine for next year's strain, but rather to combat a strain already killing people worldwide. It took most of a year for the CDC and Sanofi to come up with a hypothetical H5N1 vaccine, and the new National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza contains the expectation of years to accumulate enough vaccine to be useful for large populations. Never mind that the existing whole virus vaccine may not be effective against a pandemic strain.\nThe fact that the minor Fujian-like clade has donated its HA to the previously dominant strain rather than itself becoming the dominant circulating virus indicates that there may be important amino acid co-substitutions in the other proteins essential for viral fitness.\n...Even within a geographically constrained set of isolates, we have found surprising genetic diversity, indicating that the reservoir of influenza A strains in the human population -- and the concomitant potential for segment exchange between strains -- may be greater than was previously suspected.\nWe cannot think of the H5N1, or any other strain, as either a clonal population experiencing selection or as a bunch of individuals producing descendants that may accumulate mutations leading to a pandemic strain. Rather, flu viruses exists as elements of a population that appear to be constantly innovating and trading parts. This is a critical distinction, particularly in light of rapid human and avian intercontinental travel. Not only have we now learned that there is greater variation in any given set of geographically linked isolates, but because of human travel we can expect all kinds of novel parts to show up in populations that were otherwise isolated and appeared to be of no immediate threat.\nThe Ghedin paper doesn't necessarily teach us directly about the evolution of pandemic flu strains, but it does suggest our current plan for pandemic vaccination is not well suited for the problem at hand.\nAfter studying synthetic vaccines for Bio-ERA, amongst other clients, I think DNA vaccines are the best bet for rapid response on a time scale shorter than flu strains seem to evolve. I've a draft paper on synthetic vaccines in for consideration at Biosecurity and Bioterrorism, and will shortly embark on another paper specifically about distributed manufacture of DNA vaccines. PowderMed is waiting for publication of their (already accepted) first paper on their plasmid vaccine for the annual flu and will be starting trials of an H5N1 DNA vaccine early next year. Unfortunately, it seems the folks in DC aren't taking this technology seriously, and instead blowing billions on developing cell culture production of whole virus vaccines. Even the folks who manufacture vaccines in cell culture acknowledge this will only cut a month or two off the response time.",

For every pound spent by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust to fund a VIA, an additional four pound has been leveraged from an external agency.\nThe VIA programme is structured as a competitive leverage funding programme, whereby funds will only be awarded following success of an application to an external funding body. External funding bodies include government funding bodies, academic institutions and other medical research charities where applications undergo peer review.\nWe agree VIA funding in principle prior to submission of external funding body applications. Please contact us well in advance of your submission in order for us to consider your application so we can add a letter of support.\nThe VIA programme relies on the science being peer reviewed by the external funding body, thus we can only consider applications where this peer review will take place. For industry awards we request evidence of internal review prior to awarding funding, please contact us for the process.\nIf you wish to apply for a VIA, please contact us researchgrants@cysticfibrosis.org.uk.\nSince we started funding these awards in 2013 we have awarded over 50 grants across a range of different research areas. Descriptions of the types of research we\u2019re funding are listed below, where you can find out more about ongoing projects in the research areas that interest you.\nYou can also see who we have partnered with in each VIA, using our colour-coded labels for: NIHR partner, Charity Partner, Pharmaceutical Partner, Academic Partner, Government Agency Partner and Registry Study\u200b.\nThe timing of lung exacerbations or a worsening of CF symptoms can be very hard to predict. We\u2019re currently funding studies in children and adults to understand more about them. If we can predict when they might happen, then we can treat them quicker and ultimately aim to make them happen less often.\nFind out more about research into lung exacerbations here.\nWhile the symptoms of CF are well known, better ways to manage them are continually being developed, helping to keep people healthier and reducing their effects on quality of life. Our research projects range from ensuring that the way lung function is measured is as accurate as possible, to developing drugs that can help break down the mucus in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about research into managing symptoms here.\nPeople with CF can have a range of different lung infections, and it\u2019s important to know which infections are present and how to treat them. Understanding how bacteria work can lead researchers to spot weaknesses that can be targeted with drugs. The research we\u2019re currently funding includes learning more about the bacteria to identify their weak spots, discovering how to disrupt the formation of \u2018biofilms\u2019 that cause antibiotic resistance and developing methods to speed up the detection of bacteria in samples from people with cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about research into understanding and treating infections here.\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition, caused by damage to the \u2018CFTR\u2019 gene in both copies of the gene. The location of damage within the genes can vary from person to person \u2013 this is what is known as a \u201cgenotype\u201d. Increasingly treatments are focussed on treating people with specific CF genotypes. The research we fund in this area ranges from ways to permanently correct the CFTR gene using gene editing, to early research that is working out ways to repair lung damage caused by cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about genetic research here.\nThere are different ways to approach therapies for cystic fibrosis. As well as drug therapies, the Trust is investing in gene therapies, which work to replace the damaged gene \u2013 in the case of cystic fibrosis, the CFTR gene \u2013 with a healthy copy of the gene. The Gene Therapy Consortium is a group of researchers based at Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh who are working together to develop gene therapies for cystic fibrosis.

    "text": "Leading 2017 Isle of Man TT newcomer Adam McLean will be at this year\u2019s Armoy Road Races.\nThe big event will take place on Friday and Saturday, July 28-29.\nJoining McLean, a previous winner of the Junior Support at Armoy, will be local men William Dunlop, Neil Kernohan, Paul Jordan, Darryl Tweed, Paul Robinson, Gary Dunlop, Hexham rider Dominic Herbertson and Moto3/125 GP race winner Christian Elkin, winner of Moto3/125 GP race in 2016.\nWith entries yet to close (July 3) and the 2017 TT just finished, many riders are now turning their attention to Armoy and confirming their attendance.\nThe announcement was made at the official launch of the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019, which was held at Gracehill House, Stranocum yesterday alongside a keynote presentation from David Wallace, the film producer of Road Racers and a local Dunloy man.\nThis year is the 40th anniversary of the original 1977 documentary, which truly captured the heady mixture of three local men, their families and their passion, drive and love of road racing.\nHe gave a short presentation on why and how the film was made but having won two BAFTAs for other work.\nSome key scenes of the film depict the three riders, Joey Dunlop, Mervyn Robinson and Frank Kennedy, riding through the village of Armoy where they often tested their bikes.\nBill Kennedy MBE, Chairman and Clerk of the Course, AMRRC said: \u201cWe are delighted to host, film producer and local man, David Wallace. It is difficult to comprehend that this film, Road Racers, was made 40 years ago, let alone the impact this film would have in years to come, the place it has in people\u2019s hearts and the iconic level that it has reached across the whole road racing community.\n\u201cThe Armoy Road Races came about as most of you know, after a bit of craic in a local pub. It\u2019s hard to believe come September that we will be in our tenth year and that we continue to celebrate all of our road racers, past and present, including the reputed Armoy Armada.\n\u201cIt is also hard to be believe how exceptionally fast 2017 is disappearing but we are on target with our planning. With additional monies from the Department of Communities and some work on the roads, courtesy of Transport NI, these races are set to be one of the best.\n\u201cWilliam Dunlop was man of the meeting in 2016 and I\u2019ve no doubt he will be keen to revisit his Armoy winning streak. As of yet, brother, Michael Dunlop, who retains the title of Race of Legends winner, having won in six successive years has yet to confirm his entry but the Club is hopeful he will race on his home course come July.\nAlso in attendance were the Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Councillor Joan Baird, Terence Brannigan, Chairman of Tourism Northern Ireland, members of the Armoy Club and other guests and sponsors including title &apos;Race of Legends&apos; sponsor, Roadside Kia.\nTerence Brannigan, Tourism NI Chairman also commented: \u201cArmoy Road Races are one of Northern Ireland\u2019s prime motorsport gatherings, attracting motorcycle riders and spectators both locally and internationally.\n\"As the event goes from strength to strength it has an important role to play in tourism, in contributing to the economy and in enhancing our reputation as a destination.\nBill Kennedy concluded: \u201cI\u2019d like to finish by thanking event sponsors Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and Tourism NI for their very kind support.\n\"I\u2019d also like to thank our title sponsor Roadside Kia. Without the support and sponsorship from these organisations and other sponsors present here today, the event just wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nThis year, Bike Week runs from Sunday July 23 until Saturday July 29 with the races taking place on Friday, July 28 and Saturday, July 29 culminating in the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019.\nThe Armoy Road Races are part funded by Tourism Northern Ireland and the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council.",

    "text": "Folio [29.0 x 20.1 cm], 4 books in one volume, (6) ff., 35 ff., (1) f., 48 ff., (2) ff., (14) ff., 31 ff., with more than 300 woodcuts in the text, many of which are full page. Bound in contemporary limp vellum, manuscript title on spine, remnants of ties, red sprinkled edges. Minor soiling and edge wear to binding, front pastedown torn and unglued, book labels of the historian J. B. Bury (861-1927) and Michael Bury (on the front flyleaf) and of the 19th-century English bookseller Samuel Maynard (inside upper cover). Minor spotting and wrinkling to title, mended marginal tear to p.l. 4, the occasional contemporary annotation, minor toning to a few leaves, the occasional minor stain, small marginal burn hole at f. II.42, minor wrinkling and small marginal tear in first quire of Book II, final leaf backed and with moderate toning.\nVery rare, with only one recorded copy in America (Harvard), the first complete edition (see below) of the sculptor and goldsmith Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s (1535-1600) highly influential treatise on the practice of art and architectural theory extensively illustrated with more than 300 woodcuts. This work is important for being \u201cthe first printed and illustrated treatise on artistic anatomy\u201d (Skaarup, 254) and the second published original architectural treatise composed in Spanish, following only Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526). Remarkably (and rather mysteriously), some two dozen of Arfe\u2019s anatomical woodcuts in this work are derived from drawings by Leonardo da Vinci (via intermediary copies), providing a fascinating example of how Leonardo\u2019s graphic work circulated in the wider European art world centuries before his drawings were published (Skarrup, 353-4; R\u00f6hrl, pp. 40-96, 142-45). The De Varia Commensuracion para la Esculptura, y Architectura (1585-7) \u2013 which covers in its four books geometry, human anatomy, the proportions of quadrupeds & birds, as well as classical architecture & contemporary Spanish metalwork \u2013 was the \u201cmost frequently republished\u201d and consulted treatise on artistic practice and theory in Spain up to the turn of the 19th century (see Bonet Correa, p. 145), appearing in ten editions, the early ones being very rare. Its continuing influence has been recognized by its widespread inclusion in libraries of early Hispanic artists on both sides of the Atlantic, characterized by a \u201cmasiva presencia de Vitrubios, Vignolas, Serlios y Arfes\u201d (Soler I Fabregat, p. 149 and passim). The painters Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Alonso Cano are but a few known to have owned a copy of Arfe (Fajardo, 88-90).\n\u201cThe success of the Varia in Spain and in Latin America was extraordinary, being a compendium in a single volume of distinct fields of artistic and scientific knowledge, the borders of which were not at the time established with the same categorical precision as they are today\u201d (Bonet Correa, 157). Books Two and Four are the two most historically influential parts of the Varia. Book Two, on human anatomy, is divided into four subchapters on proportion, osteology, myology and foreshortening of the human figure. Arfe claims here a number of influences, including D\u00fcrer\u2019s treatise on proportion (1528) and Juan Valverde de Amusco\u2019s interpretations of Vesalius\u2019 Fabrica, but he also mentions the artists Pollaiuolo, Baccio Bandinelli, Raphael, Donatello, Mantegna, Michelangelo and the Spaniards Pedro Berruguete and Gaspar Bezerra (ff. 1v-2v). Arfe comes to the practice of artistic anatomy having spent time as a student training in the dissection theater under the direction of the famed physician Cosme de Medina (d. 1591) at the University of Salamanca (f. 25v), leading scholars to remark that \u201cNowhere in an Iberian context was the close, even dependent, relationship between anatomists and artists more evident than in Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s Varia \u2026 the Libro segundo is a rare and unique source produced by an anatomically trained artist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 246). According to Choulant, the Varia \u201cshould\u2026 be considered the earliest of the numerous works which dealt with anatomy for graphic and plastic artists\u2026\u201d (Choulant, p. 32).\nBook Three of the Varia, on the proportions of animals, draws heavily from Conrad Gessner\u2019s four-volume Historiae Animalium (1551-8) and includes, along with depictions of more common birds and quadrupeds, the images of an elephant, camels, ostrich, and D\u00fcrer\u2019s famed rhinoceros. Arfe\u2019s horse recalls the equestrian statues of the Italian Renaissance and serves as a reminder that establishing the precise proportions of the horse was also a preoccupation of such artists as Leonardo (in the Codex Huygens) and Sebald Beham (Proporcion der Ross, 1528).\nIn Book 4, Arfe writes of the Roman ruins in Spain, the architecture of Bramante, Baldassare Peruzzi, and Alberti, as well as modern Spanish architects and those goldsmiths whose work (on liturgical vessels) can be characterized as \u2018micro-architecture,\u2019 beginning with the metalwork of his grandfather. Arfe illustrates the classical Orders based on Serlio, adding a sixth \u2018Attic\u2019 order, and treats various aspects of architectural ornament. At the time of its publication, the Varia was only the second original architectural treatise composed in Spanish \u2013 following Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526) and derivative works of translation such as Villalpando\u2019s Tercero y Quarto libro de Serlio (1552), Zamorano\u2019s Diez Libros de Architectura of Alberti (1582), Miguel de Urrea\u2019s Vitruvio (1582) (Fajardo, 130; Bonet Correa, 158). \u201cArfe\u2019s treatise, with its more timeless character, transcended its own era\u201d (Bonet Correa, 158). Although the Medidas del Romano of Diego Sagredo appeared in three Spanish editions and further French and Portuguese translations, its emphasis on the \u2018Plateresque\u2019 style of architecture contributed to the waning of its popularity during the 17th century, even as the popularity of Arfe\u2019s treatise increased.\nArfe extends Book 4 with a highly original discussion of metalwork, in which he aligns his own specialty with the more theoretically sophisticated field of pure architecture. His woodcuts of liturgical items (monstrance, chalice, aquamanile, crosier, crosses, candelabra, censer, etc.) are given a rigorous proportional treatment, with more sophisticated \u2018micro-architecture\u2019 custodias being shown in plan as well as in elevation, in the manner of full-scale buildings. Some of these illustrations depict surviving works by Arfe, while others are taken to be designs for lost or still unidentified pieces. It should be noted that while Arfe \u2013 despite the popularity of his treatise \u2013 perhaps was unable in his time to elevate his craft as a theoretically complex art alongside painting, sculpture and architecture, in recent times, art-historical research has vindicated his contention that metalwork of the highest quality should be prized not only for its pure material value and symbolic-liturgical importance, but also for its participation in the wider debates about the nature of representation, the supremacy of panting vs. sculpture vs. architecture, etc.\nBooks One, Two and Four of the Varia are dated 1585 on their colophons, while Book 3 is dated 1587. The first two books are occasionally found bound without Books 3 and 4, and it is surmised that the final two books appeared in 1587 (in spite of the 1585 date on Book 4), after an interruption in printing caused by a fire or a controversy about privileges, at which point the complete work was bound together as seen in the present copy (Fajardo, 72-2; Bonet Correa, 159).\nJuan de Arfe was the third in a line of renowned metalworkers originally hailing from Germany \u2013 following his grandfather, Enrique, and father, Antonio \u2013 and is known to have been active in Valladolid, Sevilla, and Madrid. His custodias (monstrances) at the Cathedral of Sevilla and Avila remain celebrated works of Renaissance goldsmithing in the classical mode, showing the influence of Donatello and Bramante, among others. \u201cArfe\u2019s last sculptural works of life-size human figures, such as the exquisite tomb monument for the Archbishop of Seville, Don Crist\u00f3bal de Rojas, reveal his development as a leading naturalist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 253; see principally Sanz, and Fajardo for Arfe\u2019s artistic activity). In addition to the Varia, Arfe published Quilatador de plata, oro y piedras (1572) and Descripci\u00f3n de la tra\u00e7a y ornato de la custodia de plata de la Sancta Yglesia de Sevilla (1587), both short tracts on metalwork.\nThe present copy, intriguingly, carries the apparent signature of Arphe himself on the bottom margin of the title page. This exact signature is also present in the same location in copies now at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a and the Biblioteca de Castilla y L\u00e9on (effaced), a detail which might shed further light on the early publication history of the Varia.\n* Palau 16055; Adams A2003; CCBE s.

    "text": "Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nI have zentyal 3 with zarafa configured as the mail gateway.\nWhere in the file system is the user mail stored? I would like to know for backup purposes etc.\nIe if I was restoring the server from an image what would I need to restore from the backup to recover the mail.\nRe: Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nFound using forum search feature.\nChristian is correct. It is stored in a mysql database. Xtrabackup (Percona.com) for live incremental backups or mysqldump to backup just the email. By default mysql is setup for one big file instead of table per file.\nUse the ssh connection method with your regular user name.\npassword is stored in /var/lib/zentyal/conf/sa-mysql.passwd.\nThis gets you initial connection as sa. You can then add a user with needed privileges to do what it is you want to do. I do not recommend using the sa regularly. I assume that you are going to the mysql-dump route?\nHmm. . . this gets asked often enough that maybe it should be a sticky or in the tips and tricks section. Add on that eventually the email system will get sluggish and prone to crashing because of the \"all tables in one file\" decision and I think that a decent write up is in order. Sort of follows along with my next free time (chuckle) project which is to play with clustering Zentyal. I haven't forgotten that, christian. Just incredibly busy.\n*hint hint* volunteers please step forward..\nFirstly thanks for everybodies help on this.\nI'm running zentyal 3.0 (core 3.0.17) so what I'm about to say may not be relevant to earlier versions.\nthere are a few corrections to what folks have said on here.\nThe mail isn't actually stored in the MySql zarafa db. I loaded around 8000 mail items into the zarafa and it didn't significatnly affect the size of the database.\nThe mail and also the zarafa-search indexes (if enabled) are actually stored in the file systm under /var/lib/zarafa.\nThe configuration files would give the impression that this is just attachments but it appears to be all emails as well. Each email and attachement is stored in a nested, numbered folder structure as a gziped file.\nI wanted all my data stored on a NAS rather then on the server itself. This was quite easy to achive for the mail. It was simply a matter of copying /var/lib/zarafa to a new location and then creating a symlink from the /var/lib folder to the new location.\nRe: [SOLVED] Where is the mail stored in the filesystem?\nI am taking a closer look at users and privileges concerning mysql in the latest version. The file structure that you describe is really just the index.\ncopy the directory somewhere for safe keeping.\nOne not of caution -- I don't store attachments outside the database so I can't verify where they are.\nDid you setup file per table? If not they are stored in /var/lib/mysql/ibdata1. You will find that ibdata1 is rather large.\nBTW mysql doen't play nice over nfs. If you want real-time redundancy, you will have to setup replication (now you are getting into HA and load balancing).\nI was wondering about backing this file up. I run automysqlbackup which backs up all the databases. Will this be included somewhere? In the zarafa db backup? I wonder because it's sat outside the zarafa folder?\nIf you configured it to backup all databases then yes it will do the work. There are pluses and minuses to using mysql-dump. While every mysql install will have the tool, it still demands server downtime while backing up. Incremental, no downtime backups can be had with xtrabackup.\nThe design decision (not bug) in mysql s innodb engine causes it to become unstable over time in my experience. The database doesn't shrink as you remove data. Instead the file stays the same size and just the row information is removed. It tends to make things too big for the memory and storage footprint after some time. It also fragments the data causing queries to run slower. Normal optimization tools don't work on innodb in the single file configuration. Some will find this as an issue and some will never know. I know because I support 100+ email accounts on my system and it is very active.",

But it\u2019s so much more than that.\nThe Joseph story is sometimes described by scholars as \u2018the Joseph cycle\u2019. This is a helpful term. In Genesis, there are similarly \u2018cycles\u2019 of stories about Abraham (Gen. 12\u201325) and Jacob (Gen. 26\u201336); and in other parts of the Bible, there is a \u2018David Cycle\u2019 for example (1 Sam. 16\u20131 Kgs. 2) and one about Elijah (1 Kgs. 17\u20132 Kgs. 2). A \u2018cycle\u2019 in this sense is a series of connected and continuous narratives about a central figure, in which the component parts nevertheless have their own separate coherence and integrity\u2014like episodes in a TV drama series perhaps or like the individual parts in a \u2018cycle\u2019 of Medieval mystery plays.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to take a closer look at this classic Bible story, Living the Dream provides easily digestible chunks to help you get the most from it. Each chapter of the book often aligns with a single chapter of the story of Joseph.\nWhile you\u2019re at it, add another book from the same collection for just $0.99!\nThis month only, when you get Living the Dream for free, you can also snag God, Pharaoh and Moses for less than a buck.\nIn God, Pharaoh and Moses, William Ford tackles questions like: why does God send a series of plagues to Egypt? How do we understand the hardening of Pharaoh\u2019s heart?\n1. Get your free book.\n2. Add another for $0.99.\n3. Enter to win the entire 9-volume Old Testament Studies Collection.",

The most important changes were alteration of item 0408 (Personnel Transfer Basket) and insertion of Addendum 4-A (Rules Governing Personnel Transfer Basket).\nAccording to the DPC, the purpose of the alterations is to help to safeguard human life in offshore operations and to fine tune the safety technical requirements for the manufacturing of personnel transfer baskets - a concern of the Public Prosecution Service for Labor issues, which wants to improve worker safety in transfers between vessels and platforms.\nNORMAN-05/DPC Addendum 4-A specifies that the structural features must be able to protect passengers from lateral, vertical and head impacts and must be made of stainless steel bars of tubes and enable buoyant material to be attached around it, so that an entire fully loaded basket assembly is able to float.\nIn order to meet the Brazilian legislation, Reflex Marine has launched the FROG-6, an operational tool that is able to provide a safe option for personnel transfers. The FROG-6 has been subjected to a variety of impact tests to verify its structural integrity and shock-absorbing capability and demonstrated its ability to self-align and float in water, something that is not possible with the traditional rope baskets.\nSandra Antonovic, the company's Chief Operating Officer (COO), says that, \"it is a safer method than the traditional rope basket, because it protects the passengers in the event of a lateral or vertical impact, fall or heavy landing. Furthermore, the buoyancy panels enable the device to float and self-align.\"\nAntonovic points out that the device is able to transfer injured people in safety, protecting them from falls, immersion and lateral and vertical impacts, confirming that, \"The FROG-6 is also a safe and versatile transfer device in Medevac (medical evacuation) mode.\"\nAccording to the executive, this change reinforces Brazil's position and desire to ensure an offshore environment that has minimal operational risks. Antonovic says that, \"By prioritising the safety of offshore workers, Brazil is placing itself alongside Norway, the UK and Canada - countries in the vanguard of ensuring that all workers return home safely.\"",

    "text": "sailboat. : The sweetest home accessories!\nYou know when you see something that you don't really need but you do really want to have for reasons you can't quite fully explain? Well, that's exactly how I feel about pretty much everything from Qualy. Until a few weeks ago I had never heard of the brand, I had a Zalando voucher and just happened to stumble into the home section where I spotted the sweetest home accessories ever!\nSo, I didn't really need a pink bunny with scissors for ears, a carrot magnet and green paper clips for the carrot top but as soon as I saw it, crazy bunny lady over here was instantly adding it to my basket and hitting checkout! I'm really impressed with the quality, I did think the \u00a315 price tag was a little much but I've changed my mind because the scissors are actually really good, it doesn't feel or look cheap in any way and, well, it's undeniably cute! I love it so much!\nQualy Log & Squirrel Flower Pot!\nI'm not known for my green thumb, in fact I'm notoriously rubbish at keeping plants alive but I'm going to try and be better now I have this super cute flower pot! I don't have a plant to put in it at the moment but I'm actually really excited to go and get one, any excuse for a trip to the garden centre I'll happily take! When there's water in the bottom the squirrel floats up, which is perfect for a plant killer like me because I'll always know when I need to add some more water. At \u00a325 this certainly isn't cheap, but again I'm really happy with the quality & everything comes apart so I think it'll be really easy to clean. To be honest it was the little squirrel that totally sold me on this, look at those sweet little eyes, too cute!\nDo you have a favourite home accessories brand?\nDo you have anything from Qualy?\nThe only thing that I found with the pot was that somehow the roots have gone down the string and completely intertwined with it so I won't be able to use the pot for another plant in the future :') Still absolutely adorable though!\nI really love the Qualy range, I've been fancying the bunnies for agfes, have you seen the paperclip ones as well?\nDUh, I meant the tape one.\nThe desk bunny is just sooo lovely!\nYou got the bunny! Jealous, it's totally on my list after you posted about it before. That plant pot is exactly what I need too! Horrible at watering plants and keeping them alive. We even just tried again recently with some herbs. Sad days when they die!\nSuper adorable. I love the pink bunny!\nThese are so cute! I love them both, the squirrel is such a fab idea, too.\nOh my goodness, I want them both! So freaking adorable.\nOh my goodness. I need one of these in my life, this would totally perk up my desk at work!\nFar too much love for these things!\nOmg! How adorable is that bunny?!\nOh my, the squirrel is just too cute!!!!\nOh my dear, these are so so cute! I adore the bunny. It stole my heart.\nThat desk bunny is actually the best thing I've ever seen, their things are so lovely!\nOh my, these are a bit too adorable eh!!",

    "text": "Just took a \u201cTrophy of a Lifetime\u201d What\u2019s Next?\nYou have just harvested a trophy of a lifetime maybe it will even make the Boone and Crocket or Pope and Young record books, now what? This experience may not be encountered again for many years for most hunters, so you need to be made aware of the questions a taxidermist will ask you and what you need to Mounted Whitetail Deerask them before contacting a taxidermist. You also know that you will have the animal mounted by a reputable taxidermist. Selecting a taxidermist can be almost as challenging as harvesting your new trophy.\nWhat Room will Display the Mounted Animal?\nWhere are you going to hang your new trophy mount? The room in which the mount will hang is a contributing factor on the pose you will select for the mount. There are so many poses available! If your ceilings are around 8\u2032 high or a basement den, the ceilings are not likely to be vaulted. How tall are the antlers? A full upright taxidermy pose might require the mount to hang low on the wall. There are three basic form poses \u2013 upright, semi-sneak, and full sneak. With an upright form, the neck is in a vertical position almost parallel to the wall. The semi sneak form has the neck and head down at approximate 40 degree angle off the wall. The full sneak pose has the neck at almost 85 degrees from the wall. For a low ceiling, a semi sneak or full sneak may be the better choice for your new trophy mount.\nTime to Interview The Taxidermist!\nWhere can I see some of your work? You need to look at their work very close. Look at the eyes, is it a natural look or does it look like the animal is bug eyed? Feel the back of the head between the antlers and slide your hand down the back of the neck. Do you feel the Stitches they used to sew the hide together? Has the hide shrunk? You will not notice this with true tanned hides.\nFound your Taxidermist \u201dEnjoy\u201d your Trophy!\nThe return time of your trophy mount is not as important as the above questions if you feel you have found the right taxidermist to do the mount for you. It should still be around 1 year, but 1 1/2 years is not uncommon! The Last this is the cost of the mount. How much is it worth to you? If you think you have found the right person to mount the animal the actual cost should not impact your decision. After all you get what you pay for!!\nBe Prepared buy a Quality Knife!\nYour knife is your best friend when you are in the outdoors and trying to survive. The survival knife is a tool that can be used in so many ways; it is the most invaluable tool you may possess. There are literally hundreds of different knives to choose from but you should be choosing one before you leave for the outdoors.\nBuy a Survival Knife that fits YOU!\nSize: You want your knife to be small enough to carry but large enough to be used to cut branches from trees, butcher meat and even for digging.\nSharpness: Your survival knife should be sharp at all times especially when you first purchase it, if it isn\u2019t sharp then, then it never will be.\nBalance: Your knife should have a good balance to it, meaning the blade and handle will complement each other. When you swing the knife, the weight if the blade should be doing a lot of the work. Try a few knives and you will notice how they differ in balance and pick the one that best suits you.\nGood Handle: The handle of the outdoor knife should be comfortable to use and preferably made of wood as this means it won\u2019t slip as much.\nIf possible try and get a knife that is fixed blade. This means that the blade of the knife doesn\u2019t fold in. A fixed blade knife is more reliable and safer to use as some folding knives don\u2019t lock well or can slip and cause injury. Always make sure your knife has a good sheath, leather is the best kind, and that it is sheathed when not in use.\nA Good \u201cSharpening Stone\u201d is a Must!\nThe proper care and maintenance of your knife is extremely important and should be a daily ritual when it is in use. Sharpening the blade is essential and the best way to do this is to purchase a sharpening stone. Diamond sharpeners and other type of sharpeners are good but none of these do as good a job as a sharpening stone in the hands of someone who knows how to use one. Your knife\u2019s blade should be sharpened to a point that is not too steep and is still thick enough not to chip.\nTo properly use a sharpening stone, it is best to dampen it first and then move the blade over the stone in a circular motion on angled so that you are removing the burrs and chips from the cutting edge, you will feel it when you get that perfect angle. When Sharpening the blade it must be simultaneously flipped to get the best cutting edge possible. A sharpened blade should have no burrs and the angle of the cutting edge should be constant.\nYour knife is your best friend when in a survival situation. Choosing the right Survival knife and maintain it by keeping it very sharp knife sharpener are lessons that should be learned before heading to the great outdoors for some Outdoor Survival fun.",

    "text": "Edith Grossman\u2019s translations recreate Spanish literature for English-language readers.\nEn espa\u00f1ol | Thanks to Edith Grossman\u2019s translations, the works of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mayra Montero, Miguel de Cervantes, and others are more accessible to English-language readers. Her latest labor of love is The Golden Age: Poems of the Spanish Renaissance (August 2006).\nQ: What led you to work on contemporary texts?\nA: My first reading of Pablo Neruda\u2019s poetry.\nQ: Why return to your roots, the late 15th-17th centuries?\nA: Translating Don Quixote in 2003 was serendipitous. Once I recovered from my shock at the request, I realized how exciting it would be. Once back in the mindset of the Golden Age\u2026I thought it would be wonderful for people to get excited about [Renaissance] poetry.\nQ: How did you choose the works in this anthology?\nA: I chose poems I like very much by poets I like very much.\nQ: Can these poems have popular appeal?\nA: Poetry doesn\u2019t make for bestsellers, but I think these poems can appeal to readers because they are brilliant and beautiful poems.\nQ: How can Spanish Renaissance literature help us understand Latin American culture?\nA: The more a person reads great literature, the more that person understands the world. The human condition is similar enough throughout time to be open to the insight gained from literature.\nQ: How does an author\u2019s use of language affect the way you translate?\nA: If a writer is using an elaborate, baroque style\u2026or a very clean, spare style, I do my best to write that kind of English. I\u2019m trying to allow the reader in English to experience the text in a way that\u2019s comparable to the way the Spanish-language reader experiences it.\nQ: When you\u2019re working on contemporary literature, how collaborative is your approach to translation? Does the author have a role in the process?\nA: The author collaborates as much as he or she wants. Some authors are not interested in seeing the translation until it\u2019s published, and even then I\u2019m not sure if they look at it. Others like to see the translation before I submit it to the publisher. I\u2019m always glad to do that because they, of course, have an insight that\u2019s denied to everyone else in the world because it\u2019s their book. Normally I don\u2019t speak to the author about the translation until the very end, when there are always a handful of terms and words that require an explanation from the author.\nQ: Which authors whose works are only available in Spanish would you most like to see translated into English?\nA: There is a wonderful Spanish author named Carlos Rojas. I think one or two of his novels may have been translated into English, but not widely distributed. He is one of the most interesting novelists I\u2019ve read in any language. He\u2019s a remarkably talented, intelligent, gifted writer, and I think he\u2019s a great territory waiting to be discovered in English.",

The idea is said to the more basic phenomenon of climate change, which refers to changes within the totality of attributes that define local weather\u2014not only sur- face temperatures, but in addition precipitation patterns, winds, ocean currents, and other measures of the Earth\u2019s local weather.\nMedina, Elaiza DC. BS PSY II. World warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the common temperature of the Earth\u2019s local weather system and its related effects. You should use public transport as a substitute of your individual car, you need to use solar cells as a substitute of ordinary electricity power, it\u2019s also possible to tell folks about international warming and assist others to understand it and lots of extra.\nYou might not think that information is constantly about crises in different nations, or issues that have occurred to different people, but extra likely the information displays a coverage or government determination that will likely be utilising your tax cash and that will affect your economic system.\nWhat is International Warming on the subject of Carbon Dioxide buildup? For the primary time in the historical past of the world, atypical individuals might stay up on what was taking place in international nations with out having to wait for the subsequent day\u2019s paper or spend cash on it. Numerous the claims that \u201cglobal warming has stopped\u201d are the result of information that, at first look, appears to help this belief.\nInnovations in printing and communication led to major adjustments to how individuals bought the information within the nineteenth century.

But pieces that are beautifully understated in their elegance can be more of a challenge to come across. Perhaps because it's easy to overdo, but timelessness takes balance and the right materials like those favored by Ellen vanHully-Bronson of Pearl Kissed Jewelry. Most of Ellen's collections are centered around one of Mother Nature's most delicate and classic \"gems\" - the fresh water pearl. Her necklaces, bracelets and earrings are all handmade and one-of-a-kind, much like each naturally derived pearl. Her designs are meant to convey an air of elegance and romance, from her simpler strings of silver and the occasional pearl bead or crystal to the more intricate signature necklace with woven \"branches\" that sit gracefully along your neckline. Ellen's pieces make wonderful gifts for moms, daughters, sisters, wives and more. A Pearl Kissed necklace can enhance any outfit, from the more casual to an evening dress. They are that charming and versatile. While Ellen has a handful of self-designed collections, she is happy to discuss custom requests for a piece that's as special as its future wearer. That makes her work very well suited for bridal parties to match the romance you want on your special day! I love how creativity runs in Ellen's family, with this business originally started as a mother - daughter duo. Her daughter then continued to follow her passions to metalwork, but still offers input on design and marketing to help drive success. Ellen is a delight much like her jewelry, a pearl among artists!",

    "text": "A number of books and articles investigated the relationship between corporate and advertising interests and news coverage. In the May/June 2000 issue of Columbia Journalism Review, Lowell Bergman wrote an article entitled, \"Network television news: With fear and favor.\" Bergman sums up his findings by saying, \"Executives of the network news divisions say that they will report any story of public interest and import without fear or favor, without considering its potential commercial consequences. They say that, but they do not believe it\" (p. 50).\nKarl Idsvoog's journal article, \"TV sitting on stories to improve ratings,\" claims that \"the decision on when (or if) to run a piece is no longer determined just by asking is the report concise, clear, and well produced; is it fair, thorough and accurate? There are now more critical questions. What's the lead-in? Where do we place the promotion? Will it deliver better numbers on Monday or Wednesday?\" (Idsvoog, p. 38). However, he adds that \"in the long run, adhering to a higher standard of ethics delivers a higher standard of performance\" (p. 39).\nCarol Guensburg examines the ethical dilemmas of news reporting that involve the media agency's owner in the December 1998 issue of American Journalism Review (p. 10). In \"When the story is about the owner,\" she determines that it is up to the individual journalists and news operations to continue reporting important stories, regardless of the impact they may have on corporate or advertising interests (Guensburg, p. 11).\nAmerican Journalism Review's October 1998 article by Jane Kirtley, \"Second-guessing news judgment,\" looks at the issue of FCC regulations of news coverage (p. 86). She notes that having the governmental agency get involved in news coverage would likely lead to the consequence that \"broadcasters will be discouraged from covering controversial issues at all\" (Kirtley, p. 86).",

Maybe this is what Romney means when he says he\u2019s going to do the \u201copposite\u201d of President Barack Obama on Israel?\nFormer Representative Vin Weber (R-MN) is currently a partner of the lobbying firm Clark and Weinstock which has lobbied on behalf of Alcoa, Hyundai Motor Company, Ernst Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, BNP Paribas, Zurich Financial Services, Ericsson, Nokia, and Panasonic. According to United Against Iran, \u201ca not-for-profit, non-partisan, advocacy group that seeks to prevent Iran from fulfilling its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons,\u201d each of these companies had or has business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Furthermore, according to OpenSecrets.org, a website dedicated to enlightening the public about how much money is spent on lobbying expenditures, Weber has lobbied on behalf of one or more of the above listed companies as recently as 2012.\nThis raises serious questions about Romney\u2019s judgment when it comes to selecting his most trusted advisers. How committed can Romney be to stopping Iran in its pursuit of nuclear weapons if one of his top foreign policy advisers actually lobbied for companies that did business with Iran? What was Weber lobbying for?\nStopping Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons is one of the most pressing national security challenges facing us today and President Obama\u2019s resolve is clear. As Obama continues to strengthen sanctions and keep all options on the table to stop Iran, Romney has a top \u201cspecial adviser\u201d who actually lobbied for companies that did business with Iran.\nThat is quite the opposite.\nWorse, this is endemic of a party-wide challenge that the GOP seems to be having with regard to doing the right thing on Iran\u2014whether to side with big business or strengthening Iran sanctions, as evidenced by the fifth party-line House GOP vote to side with former over the latter.",

    "text": "Why should you Laminate your Hardwood Floors?\nThe lamination is done by a synthetic product which is applied in various layers. it is designed to shine the outer surface of hardwood. Hardwood floors are like laminated floors but different. Because the two terms are used interchangeably, it is important to know the pros and cons of both types of flooring so that you can choose what works best with you. If you want you to want to convert your hardwood floors into laminate wood flooring, know the following facts about both types of floor.\nThe bare surface of the wood is prime a core layer of melamine resin. The resin is what provides the hardwood a waterproof coating and shine. The fiberboard material is then applied to make faux wood texture to regain the touch of the wood which has been shadowed by the use of resin.\nThe laminate hardwood flooring is apparently different from that of untreated hardwood. The shine isn\u2019t there in the raw wood, the texture is incredibly obvious and the wood grain is tremendously abundant whereas laminated floor offers a glass-like feel and finish. The untreated wood can never offer similarity; if you are fond of different textures and colors, you can go with the Harwood. When no tint or staining has been applied to the surface of the wood, the original color is what it all has, and since every plank is of different color and texture, the floors made with unprocessed wood are unique in designs.\nHowever, when you are required to lay a wooden floor to a defined area, you must know that it is essential to maintain uniformity so that the house is alike. You can\u2019t place wood of all colors and hues to the entire house, it is essential to have at least a few pieces of matching color to form a theme and design.\nThe processed wooden floors are treated with either a tint or stain because of which the color throughout the floor appears the same. Since a layer of melamine resin and aluminum oxide is added on the top of the wood, the laminated floors are harder. The resin doesn\u2019t only provide the shine it forms a strong surface above the wood, because of these coating the hardwood becomes more durable.\nThe wood becomes water resistant after a good coat of lamination. This fact that the moisture can\u2019t penetrate the material makes the floor stronger. You will not incur any moisture damage if the surface is layered with good lamination. Since the wood is a porous an alive substance, the water finds its way in through the pores residing in the substance. Wet or moist woods are prone to the damage a lot like rot and mold.\nThe laminated wood flooring is very hard to repair. Once the damage occurs the plank can be removed but even after a careful repair, the replaced planks will show out because of the difference in the application of the resin. When you are laminating a whole floor, you can get an even coat and smooth application of the product all along, but while laminating only a board, it is difficult to match the color with the rest of the floor. The amount of aluminum oxide applied on the surface is the factor which is responsible to reflect light and if it is not applied in an effective way, the color of the boards will appear different.\nHardwood is easy to maintain. You can clean the surface with a mop or a damp sponge, soap solutions and regular cleaners but with the finished or treated woods, you can\u2019t do that. Regular cleaners can damage the shine of the wood and may permanently eliminate the sparkle. The surface should be protected from the scratches because polished wood makes the notches visible a little more.\nAuthor Bio:Emily is a content writer who loves to produce creative and informative content for people of all nature. In addition, he is also interest in Laminate Wood flooring writings to provide tips and tricks in the form of good articles.\nPrevious Article How Social Media Can Help HR Achieve Organizational Goals?",

    "text": "When we hear the word patience, we probably think of the virtue that enables us to wait. That\u2019s one way of looking at it, but Spirit-led patience is also much more. Patience is longsuffering. It involves more than passive waiting; it is active forbearance. It is a deliberate willingness to put up with disagreeable things in pursuit of higher goals.\nThe best example of patience in the Bible is God himself. A number of times, God is described as being \u201cslow to anger\u201d (see Exodus 34:6; Psalm 103:8). This phrase captures what true patience is. Patient people do more than just wait. They actively restrain their rightful anger and frustration. For a higher purpose, they put up with things that they know are wrong.\nThis is the attitude our longsuffering God has toward sinful people. For Paul, the \u201cimmense patience\u201d of Jesus meant that God put up with all his wickedness for a long time before showing mercy to him. Paul calls himself \u201cthe worst of sinners,\u201d reflecting back on the time of his life when he persecuted Christians (see Acts 7:54-8:3). But God had other plans for Paul (Acts 9:1-31; 13:1-28:31). That could easily be the testimony of every believer.\nHow wonderful that God\u2019s love rests on his own capacity for goodness, and not our own!\nDear Lord, thank you for being patient with us. Forgive us for all we do wrong, and help us to be living testimonies of your mercy. In Jesus&rsquo; name, Amen.",

    "text": "Tom Coolen has coached a lot of teams in his 58 years.\nHis career has spanned seven countries and 25 years. He\u2019s spent thousands of hours in rinks with teenagers in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, to grizzled pros in Europe.\nAnd he knows how to win.\nDuring the 1992-93 season, he led the Acadia University men\u2019s hockey team to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport national championship at the storied Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.\nBut nothing compared to what he felt on Feb. 26 of this year.\nOn that day, Coolen helped lead the St. Thomas University men\u2019s volleyball team to the Atlantic Colleges Athletic Association championship as co-coach.\nSTU was the underdog in the match against Holland College, as a team made up of mostly first-year players taking on the top-ranked team.\nThe team moved on to the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association national championships. They finished last in the tournament of eight teams last weekend, outmatched against squads from Ontario and Quebec.\nBut for a team that sat out last season due to a hazing suspension and had to rebuild from scratch, an ACAA championship was more than what anyone could have expected.\n\u201cWith the team being [suspended], I looked at it that we were a new team and this was a fresh start. It was a new beginning to the program.\nIt was that attitude, along with his winning reputation, that brought a professional hockey coach to STU to co-coach a rookie team of volleyball players.\nCoolen grew up in Halifax and played baseball in the Canada Games. After that, he went on to an Atlantic University Sport football career.\nBut hockey is the sport that has taken up much of his life.\nWith a desire to keep playing in some form, Coolen started his hockey coaching career as an assistant coach with the University of New Brunswick men\u2019s hockey team, then called the Red Devils, in 1982-83.\nCoaching took him all over the world, from the U.S. college circuit to Switzerland and Germany.\nBut his credentials go beyond the rink.\nWith master\u2019s degrees in athletic coaching and counselling, Coolen is one of only two people in the province certified by the Canadian Sports Psychology Association.\nHe now splits his time scouting major junior games for NHL Central Scouting and teaching at a school in Doaktown, N.B.\nLast fall, he met with STU athletics director Mike Eagles to talk about rebuilding the men\u2019s volleyball program. Eagles was interested in seeing if Coolen\u2019s son, Patrick, would play for STU.\nHe also wanted to see if Coolen would guide the team with rookie co-coach Francis Duguay.\n\u201cHe felt I had a lot of success as a university coach. I think he felt that would be a good place to start.\n\u201cI was familiar with the volleyball, that age level of kids entering university because I had been involved with the under-18 team [as] general manager.\nThey decided Duguay would handle the on-court coaching and run practices, while Coolen would handle the administrative side and provide general guidance on things like how to handle players.\nAs the season wore on, Coolen helped focus and motivate the young team.\nAt Christmas, the team added Coolen\u2019s son, Patrick, and veteran Andrew Keddy to the team. The libero and setter would be important keys to winning the championship, logging big minutes during the ACAA weekend.\nIn addition to having talent, Coolen knew the key to the team\u2019s success would be taking the program seriously.\nThe week before the championship weekend, Coolen used his sports psychology training to help the team get ready physically and mentally for the challenge ahead of them, starting with practicing at 100 per cent every day. He believes you play how you practice.\nMuch of the roster can play at least another three years at STU if they want to, but Coolen isn\u2019t sure he\u2019ll be there to guide them next season.\n\u201cI came in to establish it and get it started.",

    "text": "1) The development of screw conveyor can be divided into two process, shaft type auger conveyor and shaftless type auger conveyor.\na. Shaft type auger conveyor consists of screw, U type trough, cover plate, inlet, outlet and drive device, which has three types of installation mode, horizontal, inclined and vertical mounting.\nb. Shaftless type auger conveyor uses shaftless spiral blade to replace screw, and U type trough is equipped with replaceable lining. The structure of shaftless type auger conveyor is simple, the material is fed into inlet and moving towards outlet by spiral blades. The whole conveying process is made in a fully closed trough.\n2) GX type auger conveyor is appeared in early phase of screw conveyor and is the earliest universal equipment in China. It mainly transports powdery, granular and small lumpy material, and is not suitable to convey perishable, viscous, easily caked and large chunks of material, because these material are easy to bond on the spiral blades, or block at the position of hanger bearing, which will cause inconvenience to the transportation process. The advantages of GX screw conveyor are energy-saving, low consumption, dust prevention, good sealing, low noise, well-adapted, easy operation and maintenance, flexible arrangement of the positions of inlet and outlet. The disadvantages are huge power consumption, quick wearing of conveyor parts, serious material crushing in the transportation process.\n3) LS type auger conveyor is new generation of screw conveyor, which is designed and improved on the basis of GX type auger conveyor. The advantages are novel structure, reliable performance, advanced technology, wide range of application, significant energy saving and consumption reducing.\n1) Large capacity, high speed and long service life.\n2) Low energy consumption. Most of the energy for screw conveyor is spent on abrasion.\n3) Intelligent development. The future auger conveyor should be closely connected with computer. It will be suitable for program control and intelligent operation. The material handling, equipment installation and maintenance should be intelligent management.\n4) Screw conveyor can be curved transportation.\n5) Combined, compound and large-scale transportation mode. Screw conveyors are co-used with various kinds of continuous conveying equipments to finish complicated material handling. Large-scale transportation includes large capacity, the length of single conveyor and high angle conveying, etc.\n6) To expand the scope of application. At present, the usage range of auger conveyor is restricted. The scope of application should be expanded, to design the auger conveyors that can be operated in corrosive, radioactive, flammable material environment in the condition of high and low temperatures, as well as the conveyors which can transport molten, explosive, easily coking and viscous materials.\n7) To design auger conveyor using environmental awareness, and reduce the pollution to achieve the goal of green design.\nPK Machinery is a professional manufacturer of vibrating screen, screw conveyor, belt conveyor, bucket elevator and scraper conveyor, further information, please click:www.pkmachinery.com.",

You can get away with not scoring if you fold them just right, but scoring makes it easier to fold accurately, and I recommend scoring for best results.\nUsing your mat, ruler, and scoring tool, line up your ruler along scoring lines and score.\nDo this for all the folding areas on the template.\nNext, you will need to cut out your template along the outside border of the design.\nTo get your mini valentine treat bags ready to glue, fold and press all scoring lines until your template looks like the one shown here.\nUsing your glue stick or crafter\u2019s tape, run adhesive along the the side.\nPress to hold it together.\nDo the same for the bottom of the bag, and fold up.\nTurn your assembled mini valentine treat bag over and fill with your favorite small candies or non- candy valentine items such as crayons.\nPut a dab of tape on the top flap to close. Then, choose which faux \u201cpaper tape\u201d you want to use. There is a solid color, or a blank one you can write on. You can also accessorize your tape with glue and colored glitter, or use matching colored washi tape instead!",

    "text": "\"You have a bunch of stuff and still talk about simplicity, what's with that?\"\nWell, I have accumulated a few things in my life. I used to make a lot of money (relatively speaking). I bought the Mercedes, the toys, the stuff.\nI have gotten rid of a lot, and am trying to learn to get rid of the rest. I want to keep only what I need, and maybe a few wants. It is hard. I grew up with little, so when I was making decent money, I wanted to buy the stuff I never had. Over time I have come to the realisation the stuff never made me happy. I found the doing is better than the having.\nI have acquired many of the things I have by coincidence or luck. I am not afraid to dumpster-dive. I take my kids if I can, we make it a game. I have stopped on the side of the road to pick up something that someone else is tossing out. My wheelbarrow came from the dump, some guy was tossing it because \"it's annoying\", whatever that means.\nI have traded a lot. Craigslist is my friend when it comes to trading.\nValue is the governing factor with the things I possess. I was going to say own, but I don't think I own anything, I just possess it until it leaves my possession. I still have trouble letting go though, some things just have too much potential.\nI feel qualified to share my experiences and tips with the world because I am actually doing every one of the steps on my list. I have been unemployed for 16 months (I did work for two months in the middle there). For ten of those months I collected no unemployment benefits. I now am collecting unemployment benefits (I felt that I shouldn't do it, but someone reminded me that it was my money). I am going to school on the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, and making it work on the little money I get from these two sources. My wife is a nurse and can make good money, but we choose for her to work less so she can be home for the summer with the kids. During the rest of the year she works and we save, we have eliminated most of our bills to make this a possibility. I am now unemployed by choice because juggling school, work, and kids is too much for anyone person and my heart goes out to those that manage to do it. My wife was in that position when we met and I quickly convinced her to stop working and let me handle the money part so she could continue her schooling. I saw how hard it can be, and do not want to do that myself (she is definitely stronger than me).\nI like stuff, it is programmed into me from my childhood, from TV, from the outside forces of the media and U.S. culture. I am trying to de-program myself.\nInstead of working hard just so we can pay the credit card bills and loans for the stuff we don't need, we work what we need to, just so we can do the things that give us the one thing we truly own, memories.\nI've recently started reading your blog after a connection from the Bike Trailer Blog. Your situations sound very similar to mine. I applaud you for continuing education even though it may be hard financially for your family. My wife supported me and worked while I finished my degree, though we didn't have our daughter until I graduated and got my first salary job. Now my wife doesn't work so she can stay home with the little one (18 months).\nYou also posted about getting rid of your car. This is something I did about 6 months ago. We have one car (Honda CRV) and I bike to work everyday though it's a short 10 blocks. I can say we are just now over the initial regret stage and are enjoying it. I have sacrificed a few things, but I have also gained a few things (non-material).\nI have a book recommendation for you since you're talking about getting rid of stuff. \"Put Your Life on a Diet\". This is a short read by a guy who lives by himself in a small 140 Sq. Ft. trailer. He's not saying you should live in a trailer, but he does have lots of ideas about slimming down not only yourself but everything else in your life. I was very inspired by this and have recently rid my entire house of things that haven't been used in one year (to the tune of about $400). Like you I am also a Craigslist veteran.\nI can't say I share your view on tools though. I feel it's less important to have a good set of tools and more important to have a neighbor who has a good set of tools (and a good relationship with such a neighbor). I've cleaned my gutters quarterly using my neighbor's 10 ft. step ladder.",

Native to the Mediterranean, where it grows wild on sun-drenched hills, it has traveled far and wide and has taken up residence in gardens everywhere. With its lovely, lavender blue flowers and fragrant pungent odor, it as entwined itself into the hearts of women everywhere and is a very useful herb if we open to its strengthening and empowering qualities.\nLavender has long been valued for its ability to bring courage and strength to the user. Traditionally, sprigs of lavender were tied in bundles and placed in the hands of women in labor. Squeezing the fragrant bundles was believed to give them added strength and courage during childbirth. Lavender has long been used to calm nervous stress and is especially useful during menopause and menstrual difficulties. During the Middle Ages it was a valued remedy for hysteria. I\u2019ve found it can be very healing to women undergoing their periods of intense stress to place sprigs of lavender and lavender oil in the rooms of their home. Its essence brings calmness and inner strength to the user.\nIn every culture throughout the world you will find a great body of folklore concerning the indigenous plants of that region and the wise women who used them. For thousands of years women collected plants from meadows and woodlands and used them to create healing medicines. They gathered herbs by the waning and the waxing moon, artfully created preparations, and developed herbal formulas.\nThrough an intuitive communication with the plants, women learned the healing powers of these green allies. Their wisdom developed over countless years as remedies were tried, proven, and passed on. The best of these remedies were added to the lore, and the wisdom was transferred from mother to daughter, from wise woman to apprentice for countless generations.\nThis is the legacy we have inherited. Healers, wise women, simplers\u2014these women were the center and source of medicine and healing for their communities. They understood the cycles of the seasons, the ebb and flow of the universe, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the natural rhythms of their bodies.",

Being charged with a DUI is just the beginning of a long and traumatic process. Your best chances of getting a good outcome or even a DUI dismissal is to retain a good DUI lawyer in Arizona. They will be able to determine what defense strategies may be used in your case.\nWere you charged with a DUI based on one breath test result?\nVirtually all experts concede that one breath test alone is unreliable. Breath testing is subject to various inaccuracies, including a variance as much as +/- 10.0%. This could be increased due to other factors. Therefore, two breath tests must be conducted.\nThere are many DUI defense strategies that can be used to argue your AZ DUI case against the State and prosecution. This defense is just one of many involves breath testing. Below is an excerpt from the book \u201c101 DUI Defenses 101 DEFENSES TO BEAT YOUR ARIZONA DUI \u00a9\u201d written by James Novak, Arizona DUI and Criminal Defense Attorney. For more DUI defenses, the abridged version of this E-book can be downloaded free by visiting www.arizonacriminaldefenseattorney.com.\nArizona has earned the reputation for being one of the toughest states on DUI charges in the country. The DUI laws are strict and penalties severe. If charged or arrested for an Arizona DUI, you should contact an Arizona DUI Lawyer as soon as possible. Even for first time offenders, the penalties are designed to \u201cteach a lesson\u201d so that the defendant will avoid a repeat offense and to get the word out, that Arizona has zero tolerance for those driving \u201cimpaired to the slightest degree\u201d or who may be drunk driving in Arizona due to alcohol or drugs.\nPenalties for convictions of first time, misdemeanor DUI in Arizona, depending on the circumstances may include mandatory jail time, suspension of driver\u2019s license, fines, fees, probation, mandatory counseling, and court ordered interlock devices on your vehicle to be installed at your expense.\nArizona Felony DUI or Aggravated DUI, charges can include lengthy prison terms, suspension of driver\u2019s license, exorbitant fines, fees, probation, mandatory counseling at your cost, and court ordered interlock devices on your vehicle to be installed at your expense. The Arizona Courts are especially harsh on repeat offenders and Arizona penalties reflect this.\nMany people make the common mistake of trying to seek counsel of a friend regarding their DUI who is not a licensed Arizona DUI or criminal Defense Attorney in Arizona. Resist this temptation. They are not walking in your shoes. They were not arrested. They will rarely know the Arizona DUI laws inside and out, current legislation, changing laws, defense strategies, and be experienced in defending cases in the Arizona criminal justice system. They will not bear the consequences of your DUI charges if they are not properly defended by a qualified DUI lawyer in Arizona.\nAfter an arrest for drunk driving, or DUI with drugs or medication, you should consult an attorney as soon as possible, to discuss your charges and defense options. Be sure that the Arizona DUI lawyer is experienced and defends cases often in the jurisdiction or city where you were arrested and received formal DUI charges or criminal charges. For example if you were arrested in Mesa Arizona, by Mesa Police, but you reside in Phoenix AZ, your DUI charges will be filed in Mesa Arizona, and your case will be heard through the Mesa AZ City Court. Make sure your DUI attorney defends DUI or criminal charges frequently in Mesa Arizona. It will benefit your defense if your DUI Lawyer is familiar with the court system, prosecution, and judges to hear DUI cases on a daily basis in Mesa AZ through the criminal justice system.\nThe best Arizona DUI lawyers begin defending your case with the thought process of building defense strategies that will lead to getting your Arizona DUI dismissed. That is where a good Arizona DUI Defense Attorney starts. They will base their decisions on how and what defenses to utilize based on the individual circumstances surrounding your case. Top DUI defense Attorneys in Arizona will know when and how to present their compelling arguments in your favor to get your charges dismissed. Depending on the strength and/or weakness of the prosecutions case, your AZ DUI attorney will examine the evidence, to determine if any evidence can justifiably be suppressed (not used against you). If the charges can not be dismissed, they will then attempt to negotiate with the prosecution a way of getting the charges reduced to a lesser charge, for example: a criminal charge down to a non-criminal charge, a felony to a misdemeanor, an extreme DUI to a non-extreme DUI and reduce the DUI penalties against you. In other words, in absence of being able to get the Arizona DUI charges dropped, a good AZ DUI defense attorney will make every effort to get the best possible outcome in your case.\nIf you are stopped by police for Arizona DUI, generally the police officer will use a set of five-to-six common tests called Field Sobriety Tests (FST). One thing that top Arizona Criminal Defense and DUI attorneys agree on is that so many aspects of the FST can be challenged on behalf of your defense, in an effort to get your case dismissed or charges reduced.\nTool o determine if further breath or blood tests are needed. Then they will later use your performance of these tests against you. They will make it sound like you did poorly on the tests. But in fact, even a person unimpaired by drugs or alcohol may perform these tests to a \u201cpoor\u201d standard. That is why they are often challenged.\nWAS YOU BATTERY OF FST CONDUCTED WITH CLIMATE, ENVORNMENTA OR LANDSCAPING DISADVANTAGES TO YOU?\nThe roadside could be uneven and covered by debris. The climate conditions could cause inability to perform the tests well. Were you doing the tests a surface on a hill, or a surface that contained mud, rocks, melting tar or oil, ice, snow drifts or other rough or other unsmooth or level surface? NHTSA requires that the Walk and Turn & the One Leg Stand be performed on a smooth, level surface.\nDid the officer report that you failed or did poorly on the HGN test?\nThis is the \u201cfollow the pen with your eyes test\u201d actually has a very complicated name- the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test. This test is allegedly meant to measures the involuntary jerking of the eye when a person is impaired by alcohol. When medical doctors conduct this test they do so in an areas with good lighting, employing medical equipment that holds the patient\u2019s head still and clearly lists the angles. The officer, for one test, must determine whether he detects the onset of nystagmus prior to 45%. It is almost impossible without be accurate on the angle. The test can be challenged as invalid under almost all roadside and lighting conditions.\nDid the breath test operator possess a valid, unexpired operator\u2019s license?\nIf not, the DUI breath test result is inadmissible.\nWas your blood sample preserved properly?\nThe preservation process can be an issue. The blood vials must have been stored properly prior to its use. The blood vials must not be used beyond the expiration date. The blood vials must be preserved in order to provide your defense attorney with the opportunity to test the sample with an independent lab for purposes of objectivity in your defense.\nWas the blood kit and contents in the kit, within the expiration date period? Was it properly sealed, packed, inspected, and maintained at the required temperature? When the police take your blood they usually do so using a pre-packed blood kit. However, safekeeping and inspection of the kits must be routinely performed to ensure that tubes have not expired, are sealed properly and are kept in an appropriate place that is not temperature extreme like the trunk of the car in the summer heat of Arizona.\nWas your urine sample properly tested?\nThe urine taken for drug testing must also be properly tested according to required testing procedures and protocol, for timing, specimen handling, transport, labeling, and preservation, including the containers for which the urine specimen is stored.\nWas your blood drawn within three hours of consuming your last alcoholic beverage?\nIt can take up to three hours for alcohol to be absorbed in your blood stream. If the blood draw was outside of the three hour window, the results of the BAC may be challenged as invalid.\nThese are just a few aspects of items that can be challenged to your favor if you have received Arizona DUI charges. That is why it is important to hire an Arizona DUI attorney who defends cases in the jurisdiction for which you were charged with the AZ DUI, and challenges such issues on a daily basis. It takes experience, special skills, training, knowledge and a great amount of defense litigation experience to challenge these issues in your defense. The ultimate goal of your AZ DUI Attorney is to examine some of these issues to pave the way for flaws in the prosecutions case for total dismissal, or in the alternative reduction of charges, suppression of evidence, and getting the best outcome in your case.\nA Mesa \u201cFelony DUI\u201d is also known as \u201cAggravated DUI\u201d.

These exceptional details, top-quality materials, beautiful colours, and a superb fit make up the casual yet elegant Gerry Weber look. Weber designs feminine forms, tasteful designs, and statement pieces.\nGerhard Weber was born in Halle in Westphalia, Germany, with its 20,000 inhabitants, half-timbered houses and cobblestones. From this beginning, he joined the ranks of high fashion, alongside Parisian and Milanese born designers. Weber was initially a textile salesman, who opened his first fashion shop in 1965. The clothes racks were housed at first in his parents\u2019 garage.\nIn 1973, alongside a childhood friend, Weber founded a company for the production of women\u2019s trousers. This was the birth of the Gerry Weber brand. The company expanded their production bit by bit and today also manufactures a wide range of women\u2019s blouses, dresses, jackets, coats, and knitwear too.\nWeber\u2019s strong, single fashion pieces are carefully attuned to one another when designed, meaning that it is simple to put together an outfit that really works and is individual to you and to build a wardrobe where clothes can work in different ways when put together. Weber design separates with outfits in mind, and the intelligent buyer who knows her own style can create further outfits, with a knowledge of what works for her own look and style. Yet these pieces are also designed to look superb in their own right or paired with simple separates.\nThe fact that these clothes are designed to make statement outfits makes Gerry Weber dresses and separates superb investment pieces. Each individual customer can create an outfit, look or wardrobe to reflect and express her personality and to make the most of her existing wardrobe.",

    "text": "Addiction Step Eleven: Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.\nWhat is your understanding of God and how would you characterize your relationship with Him? I can open up any number of books and read about God, or read the Bible and not know anything about His nature and character. Through these steps, how has your perception of God changed? We have talked a lot about establishing a relationship with God, but how can you have any kind of a relationship with someone you don\u2019t talk to? Through prayer and meditation we improve our conscious contact with God.\nPrayer is simply talking to God. In Steps 4-7 we were honest with ourselves, and turned to God for His help. Working through the steps, that greater power we have relied on is not just a transcendent being, someone who is unreachable, unknowable and uninterested in our recovery. When we get to the point where we surrender and rely wholly on God, we are ready to move forward into Step 11.\nThis passage shows that the person\u2019s relationship with God is a daily undertaking, that he is completely surrendered to God\u2019s leading and knows that God is always with him. In Psalm 25:4-5, the writer is asking God to show him His way.\nTrusting in God, and not yourself, implies a close relationship and the surrender that opens us up to God\u2019s leading.\nThe Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book offers some insight into this interesting journey. \u201cIn thinking about our day we are faced with indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while. (page 86)\u201d As the relationship grows, through prayer and meditation, the wisdom of God is channeled back and what we used to think was a good guess or a good idea, becomes a regular occurrence. We are open to the leading of God.\n\u201cSo I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened\u201d (Luke 11:9-10).\nEven in our indecision, God knows our needs and is ready to help. Once you are learning to communicate daily with God you\u2019re ready for the twelve and final step of your journey: When you have complete Addiction Step Eleven go to Step 12.",

    "text": "For families with housing vouchers in St. Louis, even the threat of budget cuts means dramatic consequences. For people on the waitlist, it\u2019s even worse.\nAdeena Crape may be one of the last people in St. Louis to receive a housing voucher\u2014at least for a while.\nCrape received a call late this past November from the Housing Authority. Upon learning she could pick up her voucher, she was taken aback. Years had passed since Crape put her name on the waitlist. She had dismissed the idea that a voucher would ever come. \u201cI'm not even sure how I got it!\u201d Crape says.\nCrape applied the last time the St. Louis Housing Authority opened its waitlist\u2014a fleeting five-day window in July 2014. Over the course of those five days, 27,708 residents of St. Louis put their names on the list. In other major cities, the demand for vouchers is just as extraordinary. The last time Chicago opened its waitlist for housing aid, 260,000 households applied. With that many people in the pool, the Chicago Housing Authority held a random lottery, advancing only one in every five families to the voucher waitlist. Nationwide, around 3 million families are on voucher waitlists. If the waitlists weren\u2019t closed, the number might be as high as 9 million families.\nIn the coming months, Congress will make decisions that may dramatically shape Crape\u2019s monthly housing payments, and possibly even her status as a voucher holder. With budget cuts looming, public housing authorities across the country are preparing to shrink their Housing Choice Voucher programs. Philosophically, staff in St. Louis and elsewhere will have to decide on the lesser of two evils: cut the number of vouchers or slash the value that vouchers provide.\nToday, the St. Louis Housing Authority is working its way through the waitlist chronologically\u2014and they have yet to review applicants who signed up after day one of that five-day reprieve back in 2014. That Crape spent years on the waitlist is strikingly typical. According to HUD, 35 percent of voucher holders spend more than three years on waitlists\u2014and 15 percent spend more than five years waiting. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so hard out here. I know people on the waitlist 10 years, 8 years, 6 years,\u201d Crape says.\nSt. Louis\u2019s long line to a voucher is a testament to the pent-up demand for affordable housing.\nNationwide, only one out of every four eligible households receive support. For those without assistance, conditions are worsening; between 2013 and 2015, HUD reports, the number of severely rent-burdened households increased by more than half a million.\nAgainst this backdrop, federal allocations are positioned to shrink services, shifting the costs to the individual. Cuts will disproportionately burden black women. In St. Louis, black people account for 94 percent of voucher holders. More than 80 percent are women-headed homes. For a city where almost a quarter of renters spend 50 percent or more of their income on housing, fewer federal dollars would mean more residents fighting housing insecurity.\nReceiving a voucher does not necessarily ensure that recipients will be able to obtain safe, affordable housing. Folks like Crape are already navigating a rental landscape in St. Louis in which housing stock is increasingly limited and landlords regularly discriminate against voucher holders, despite the fact that this practice is illegal within city limits. Further, just last year during budget negotiations, more than a thousand vouchers nationwide were rescinded while families attempted to secure units, sending them back to the waitlist.\nCheryl Lovell, the executive director of the St. Louis Housing Authority, administers vouchers to just under 7,000 households in the city and neighboring county. Just before the new year, HUD notified housing authorities of possible budget cuts based on Congressional proposals. The letter told directors to anticipate anywhere from a one to five percent cut in voucher program funding. \u201cI know our funding is going to go down, but I don't know by how much,\u201d Lovell says.\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that, under the last Senate bill, 25,000 households nationwide would drop off the voucher program in a year\u2014this, even though the bill increases HUD\u2019s overall funding. The House bill is significantly harsher, cutting an estimated 105,000 households from the program. Put into further perspective, the budget Trump gave to Congress would cut around 235,000 households nationwide as part of the largest proposed cut to HUD since the Reagan era.\nWhile waiting for last year\u2019s budget to pass, Lovell says industry groups predicted that funding would renew only 95 percent of her budget. The 5 percent gap would have been enough to create a small crisis, had it materialized. Given the uncertainty, Lovell was forced into the precarious position of cutting her own program.\nTo mitigate the potential damage, the Housing Authority\u2019s Board of Commissioners decided to cut costs. They froze the waitlist for the first time since a nearly two-year period in 2014, meaning no names would come off the waitlist when vouchers became available. \u201cOur first reaction, if the money gets cut substantially, is to just stop leasing to new tenants,\u201d says Lovell.\nOnce the office stopped providing vouchers to applicants from the waitlist, attrition reduced the program. \u201cThirty-five to 40 households will fall off the program every month, and you hope that this makes up for the money that you've lost.\u201d By not replacing these spots with families from the waitlist, Lovell\u2019s program can be reduced by about 450 vouchers in a given year, if needed to fill a budget gap.\nWhen the federal budget passed in May 2017, the St. Louis voucher program received more funding than expected. Still, the waitlist remained frozen for three months after the budget passed. \u201cThe leasing process itself takes a fairly long time to gear back up\u2014so you stop and you start,\u201d Lovell says. An uncertain budget increases inefficiencies.\nThe line Lovell walks was especially thin in 2013. That year, a gridlocked Congress triggered the across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. As a result, housing authorities nationwide faced a 6 percent gap in voucher funding.\nWhen housing authorities run out of other options, they sometimes turn to watering down the payment standard, or value, of vouchers. Payment standards are the maximum amount of subsidy a household can receive. When payment standards go down, tenants have a harder time making ends meet. Plus, their pool of available units is further restricted.\nFor households moving between homes in St. Louis during the summer of 2013, the support they received plummeted. The Housing Authority\u2019s idea was to reduce each voucher holder\u2019s support just enough to avoid knocking anyone off the program. Instead of receiving vouchers worth 110 percent of an area\u2019s fair market rent (the maximum), their vouchers\u2019 values sank to 95 percent. Vouchers no longer stretched as far. For example, in fiscal year 2013, a voucher for a two-bedroom unit within the city covered up to $871 of rent and utilities. Under these new payment standards and the 2013 budget, only up to $788 would be covered.\n\u201cThis shifts more costs onto low-income households, who either must pay more to remain in their current housing or move to lower cost, lower quality housing,\u201d writes Douglas Rice, senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a result, in St. Louis, fewer families were able to move out of the region\u2019s high-poverty areas, where vouchers are already concentrated within lines of racial segregation. Policy changes fenced them in: The Housing Authority denied all tenant requests to move to homes in higher-cost areas. This, despite the program\u2019s promise in increasing residents\u2019 choices.\nIn May 2013, the housing authority sent a letter outlining program cutbacks to landlords, appealing to their goodwill. Staff, bracing for cuts, planned to decrease payment standards for all tenants, thereby increasing rent burden, with as little as 30 days warning. The letter asked landlords to voluntarily defer rent increases and reduce rent by 5 percent. Lovell admits, \u201cThese two attempts to reduce cost were not very successful.\u201d Only two landlords deferred rent increases. No landlords reduced rent.\nWhen facing cuts, even housing authorities are less likely to meet tenants half way. Leeway within programs\u2014such as a payment plan for shifting income\u2014can make the difference between a family keeping and losing their voucher. \u201cBut when you're trying to control the cost and get under this cap, all the nice things you do for people, you're just like, \u2018Nope, sorry, can't do that anymore,\u2019\u201d Lovell says. Cuts to administrative funding over recent years have compounded the shrinking support that housing authorities provide to tenant-landlord relations.\nAnd while budget uncertainty diminished the voucher program\u2019s pledge of social mobility, it didn\u2019t undermine it completely. St. Louis avoided the most extreme scenario: not a single voucher was taken from a family following this budget cut. For many housing authorities nationwide it was a closer call, with tenants\u2019 livelihoods often hanging in the balance. \u201cWe do everything else before we do that, everything. We do not want to remove a family,\u201d Lovell says. But if it has to happen, the rule is simple: Last in, first out.\nToday, housing authorities everywhere, St. Louis city included, have narrower margins and shallower emergency funds than they did following sequestration. This makes the worst-case scenario\u2014housing authorities revoking vouchers\u2014all the more likely if the Trump administration succeeds in imposing radical austerity.\nWith uncertain cuts looming and an administration that is anxious to dramatically reduce housing support, Crape occupies the position of \u201clast in.\u201d Any future cost-cutting measures in St. Louis will be made in an attempt to keep her, and other households recently awarded vouchers, in their homes.\nCaitlin Lee writes, researches, and designs in St. Louis, Missouri.\nClark Randall is a freelance writer based in St. Louis, Missouri.

Most of them end up regretting because their financials become a mess after that. Whatever the reason for taking up a loan, there are factors that you will need to consider prior to taking a loan.\nFirst is the economic position of the country which has a direct impact on the interest rate. There are times in an economy when it is not advisable to take up loans unless it is for an emergency. One example of such periods is when politics is heating up prior to elections. Since interest rates are determined by central banks in respective countries, they are more likely to increase the rates during such times. When political temperatures are high, an increase is an attempt to raise more funds. Why? This is to shield the economy from political uncertainties.\nSecond is the type of financial institutions one intends to borrow from. Much as these institutions are govern by a regulatory body, they each have different lending requirements. Savings and credit cooperatives for example will require you to save a certain amount of money with them before they can give you credit. Other financial institutions only give secured loans which must be accompanied by collateral. Licensed moneylenders for example ask for collateral in form of goods worth the loan amount. Many people go to them because of the fast approval time and less stringent checks.\nThe other important thing to think about is the repayment period for the loan. Most lending institutions give options so that the borrower can select what fits them. They however try and convince their clients to spread the loan for the longest period, citing lower monthly repayments. While this may sound lucrative, you will end up paying more than someone who took the same amount and paid higher installments for a shorter period of time.\nLast but not least is reading, understanding and comparing terms and conditions of different lending institutions. In most cases they appear the same but there is always that small difference that can easily be ignored. And it makes a whole lot of difference. In fact, very few people take their time to go through the whole blue print and seek explanations on areas where they do not understand. These few individuals that do, can attest that this effort in some cases has saved them loads of money.\nIf you need a loan, approach a bank or a licensed moneylender. We are the best licensed moneylender you can find in the whole of Singapore. Our fast approval, instant cash and low interest rates are why our customers always come back to us.",

    "text": "Apparently when you have a blog, one of the obligatory posts at the end of each year is some sort of year in review. I\u2019m going to do a couple things. First, I\u2019m going to highlight the top 10 posts from the past year. By that, I mean the most clicked-on posts according to the stat counter. I have no idea if objectively they are the \u201ctop\u201d posts.\nThis is an important topic, to be sure, but Top 10? Okay.\n9. My ______ Isn\u2019t Producing! What\u2019s Wrong?\nThis is definitely one of the most common questions we get every year. People want fresh veggies as soon as possible, and it\u2019s perturbing when they don\u2019t appear right away!\n8. What is the \u201cBest\u201d Tomato to Plant?\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think anyone reading this post got their question answered, since I essentially told them that they are asking the wrong question. First, determine what you value in a tomato plant, then pick the plant that fits!\n7. What\u2019s Eating the Spinach?\nI know no one got a satisfactory answer from this post when they visited, because we never really determined what was eating our spinach either.\nA closeup picture of the tomato trellis we used in the Family of 4 Garden. I think this post is hanging on the coat-tails of one of the top 5 posts.\n5. My Tomato is Rotting!\nAh, Blossom End Rot, the disease that is not a disease. Such a ghastly looking tomato it causes too!\nOkay, I\u2019ll guarantee you that people ended up on this post because they were searching for \u201cfuzzy white caterpillar.\u201d I hope they weren\u2019t looking for anything other than pictures of cute, fuzzy white caterpillars. FYI, they are probably some type of tussock moth, but I\u2019m not a bug girl, so don\u2019t quote me on that.\nThe Family of 4 Garden and the plan for the garden that launched this whole blog project!\nWhat\u2019s not to love about big, orange, gooey, gloppy balls of stuff that show up on cedar trees in the rainy weather of spring? Well, a lot, actually. They don\u2019t hurt the cedar trees, but I\u2019m not a fan of what they do to apples!\nThe most popular post for the year: a look at the 3 different methods of training and trellising tomatoes that we used in the Demonstration Garden this summer!\nThere you have it! I\u2019ll be back after the New Year to start sharing our plans for the 2010 Demonstration Garden.\nNot much going on in the garden this week, and there probably won\u2019t be for a few weeks. You\u2019ll have to excuse me if all I get around to for the next few weeks is a couple posts here and there. Next Friday is Christmas! Can you believe it? Things will start happening again by the end of January, when we start planning the garden for next year!\nThis week I\u2019m reviewing the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange Catalog. SESE is a lot like Seed Savers Exchange, except, well\u2026they\u2019re Southern! They are based in Virginia, and a lot of their seed growers also reside in the south. The reason this is important, is their seeds are grown and saved in hot, humid regions, so they are likely well-adapted to dealing with our hot climate. It might be interesting to try the same varieties from both Seed Savers and Southern Exposure just to see if there are any differences in how they perform for us here in Kansas.\nSESE has a number of \u201cnew\u201d items this year, but I\u2019m mostly going to highlight some varieties that they have, but might be hard to find elsewhere.\nPurple Podded Yard Long Bean \u2013 This pole bean is a type of asparagus bean, or Chinese yard long bean. This particular bean is a very vigorous grower and has gorgeous dark purple beans that retain the purple color when stir-fried. You need a big trellis!\nPole Lima Beans \u2013 SESE has a nice selection of Pole Lima Beans that are hard to find otherwise. Black Knight Butterbean is a new variety that sounds intriguing. Violet\u2019s Multi-Colored Butterbean is hilarious to grow, because every pod yields different colored beans. I\u2019ve always thought it would be fun to try to isolate and breed individual varieties out of this variety.\nTashkent French Marigold \u2013 Okay, this seems like a really interesting French Marigold variety, but I have to be honest that it is mostly intriguing to me because it was found in Uzbekistan, and I find Uzbekistan an intriguing country. It is also supposedly sweet smelling, rather than astringent like most marigolds.\nAsian Tempest Garlic \u2013 What\u2019s not to love with a name like Asian Tempest? This is a very hot garlic raw, but mellow after roasting. Of course, we are past the planting window for garlic now, but keep it in mind for next year!\nGrey Griselle Shallot \u2013 SESE is one of the only sources I\u2019ve found in the U.S. for French Grey Shallots. Prized for French cooking, some consider these shallots the only \u201ctrue\u201d shallot. As with the garlic, we are past the planting time for this year.\nHave a great weekend! Get all that Christmas shopping done!\nI finally received my 2010 Johnny\u2019s catalog this week. Not that I\u2019m impatient or anything, but they have had their new 2010 items up on their brand new, sparkly website for a couple weeks now. I had to work really hard to wait to do this review until I actually had a catalog. So, without further ado, here are 5 interesting items from their catalog this year.\n\u2018Albion\u2019 Strawberry \u2013 This is a day-neutral (potential to fruit from spring to frost, but often doesn\u2019t in the middle of the hot summer here), that has a great flavor. I tried these out in Oregon and found them quite delicious. They also have good disease resistance, not to mention that perfect strawberry shape.\n\u2018Tempo\u2019 Artichoke \u2013 A purple globe artichoke that produces in only 100 days, so it can be grown as an annual. I\u2019m curious to see how well it tolerates our heat.\n\u2018Purple Pak\u2019 & \u2018Deep Purple\u2019 Carrots \u2013 This whole purple carrot business is making me a little dizzy. Last year they had \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 which is nowhere to be seen this year, and \u2018Deep Purple\u2019 was on the website, but had a seed failure. Now there is \u2018Purple Pak\u2019 and \u2018Deep Purple\u2019 is apparently in stock. Still, I have a fondness for purple carrots, so I doubt I\u2019ll be able to resist.\nIce Plant \u2013 Buried in the Micro Mix Varieties is this gem. Ice plants are frequently grown as ornamentals, but their succulent leaves are also edible. They have juicy leaves that are flavored with a hint of saltiness and lemon.\n\u2018Red Cardinal\u2019 Spinach \u2013 This is a replacement for the \u2018Bordeaux\u2019 Spinach that we had out in the garden this year. It has more oval leaves than \u2018Bordeaux\u2019 and a more upright habit. It also has red stems and veins.\n\u2018Sprite\u2019 Honeydew \u2013 This isn\u2019t exactly new, but it is new to Johnny\u2019s. You might have seen the \u201cSprite\u201d honeydew melons in grocery stores, but now you can grow them at home! These are little, 1 lb. melons with white flesh.\nThe wintery weather followed by cold temperatures today has frozen the garden pretty solid.\nThe spinach leaves are like ice cubes. They will probably thaw out in a couple days when it is warmer and do just fine. In fact, this picture was from yesterday morning, and even this afternoon, they are thawing out.\nLikewise the Swiss Chard\u2026while the bigger leaves are probably toast, the young central leaves will probably keep growing if it warms up again.\nThe Brussels Sprouts have reached the end of their lives\u2026not because they can\u2019t take the cold, but because I sawed them off this afternoon.\nI sawed them off with a pruning saw. Rather interesting \u2013 the center of the stems was hollow. I don\u2019t know if this was just the result of normal growth or if some insect had bored in. The plants are frozen solid, but they should thaw out just fine in the corner of my office. I\u2019ll snap the sprouts off in a day or two.",

    "text": "In this case study for 90 Flax Road in Fairfield, CT, you will learn how Zillow is often wrong in determining the \u201czestimate\u201d or price of the house, especially in Fairfield County, CT. Realtor, Judy Mitchell explains why this is and how not to fall into the Zillow trap. Using a house she sold in Fairfield, CT, Judy shows you how she was able to achieve a sale price of almost $20,000 over what Zillow said this house was worth. There is now more money in the pocket of the sellers because of an accurate market value analysis done on this house and by presenting this house properly to the buyers who were willing to pay top dollar for it.\nHere is what the buyers saw when we listed and sold the house for $620,000.\nThe Zillow Zestimate was $19,000 less than the price at which we sold the house! Sice Zillow has 72% market share of buyers looking for new homes, we had our work cut out for us. We needed to prove to the buyers that house was worth more. How did we do it?\nWe always use professional photography.\nWe always provide accurate floor plans.\nWe present the house to the buyers in way that builds value for our sellers.\nWe use 4 color brochures and make open houses an experience that buyers will not forget. They may see 4 or 5 houses on a Sunday, but they won\u2019t forget seeing an open house by the Judy Mitchell Group.\nWe negotiate skillfully on behalf of our clients.",

    "text": "ABOVE: A vintage cabriolet on a corniche road in Luxembourg. INSET BELOW: Minicars in Montmarte, Parisian parking.\nCar travel in Europe can be a joy or a nightmare, depending on where and when you drive. During August, when countless millions of Europeans pack up their family cars and drive to the beaches or mountains, traffic jams can rob even the most scenic European touring routes of their charm. And at any time of year, driving in a major city like London, Paris, or Rome can be nerve-wracking (or at least unpleasant) to the foreign tourist.\nSpring and fall are the best times for a motoring vacation in Northern and Central Europe. In Southern Europe, winter can also be pleasant if you avoid the Christmas break. If your vacation is tied to the school calendar, try visiting in June, before the summer season reaches its peak.\nMany tourists, especially those from North America, make the mistake of planning car itineraries built around Europe's largest cities. They end up having to cope with nerve-wracking traffic, scarce parking, and unfamiliar regulations--all while trying to catch a glimpse of the sights through a mass of cars, motorscooters, bikes, and tour buses.\nTake the train between major cities. Rent cars for local or regional excursions, or for legs of your trip (e.g., Paris to the Riviera) where you want to stop and enjoy sights along the way.\nVisit a country like Denmark, Norway, or Sweden where even the largest cities are relatively car-friendly and you can leave town for driving excursions with a minimum of hassle.\nABOVE: The Peugeot Traveller van on a European highway. Residents of countries outside the U.S. can save money with short-term tourist leases from Peugeot.\nComparison shop. Check prices at European brokers that specialize in leisure rentals and short-term leasing programs. Check each company's age restrictions if you're under 25 or over 65, and see \"Lease for longer trips\" below.\nPlan carefully. Rent a car for only as long as you'll need it, to avoid early-return penalties. If you're on a budget, avoid drop-off charges by planning a circular itinerary.\nBook ahead. If you live outside Europe, you're likely to get a better deal by making arrangements from abroad.\nLease for longer trips. A short-term car lease can save money on rentals of 21 days or more. Such \"buy back\" or \"purchase-repurchase\" leases are especially useful for students and senior citizens, since age restrictions are minimal.\nBuy a pass. A Rail 'n Drive Pass combines the speed and comfort of train travel with the convenience of a vehicle for local excursions.\nThink small. Fuel is expensive in Europe, streets are narrow in many cities, and small cars are easier to park than large ones. Unless you need a large car or van, stick with a small to midsize car.\nImportant note: If you're picking up a car outside the European Union, you may encounter bureaucratic hassles if you later decide to drop the car off in an EU country. To avoid potential problems, ask for a car that's regisftered in the EU if you plan to drive there.\nPrepare at home. European regulations, driving customs, and road signs can be confusing to foreigners, so use the information resources below to learn the basics ahead of time.\nBe alert. If you're from North America, forget about turning on the cruise control and floating along in the left lane while listening to Santana and slurping coffee from your MegaMug. You could have a panic attack when a BMW comes tearing up behind you, left flasher blinking, at 250 km/h (156 mph) or faster. And if you've never had to enter or exit a traffic circle (a.k.a. rotary or roundabout) in heavy traffic, get ready for a new experience--especially if local laws give priority to traffic coming from the right.\nCarry an International Driving Permit. This passport-like document (sometimes called an International Driver's License) is a translation of your home license. It's required in some countries and optional in others, but it's well worth having to avoid problems if you're stopped by the police or want to rent a car in a foreign country. See our International Driving Permit article.\nABOVE: The Peugeot Partner is a popular crossover vehicle in Europe.\nDo you need liability insurance in Europe? Should you pay extra for a Collision Damage Waiver, or can you rely on your credit card's free coverage? This Europe for Visitors article has the answers.\nThe interface may be more confusing than a Parisian roundabout, but be patient--and scroll down for links to pages on traffic signs.\nIcarehireinsurance has put together an infographic that shows parking signs and markings. The page also discusses parking laws and etiquette in several Western European countries.\nBrian Lucas describes his informative and entertaining article as \"an attempt to list which side of the road people drive on around the world, and to find some reasons why.\"\nABOVE: A classic Mercedes 300SL gullwing sports car outside the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.\nJeff Steiner, an American resident of Strasbourg, wrote these pages for Americans in France.\nRead our articles about car museums and factory tours, a high-speed \"race taxi,\" a self-drive \"Trabi Safari\" tour in Dresden or Berlin, and more.\nIf you can't read the German text, try The Autobahn, from Brian's Guide to Getting Around Germany, and Hyde Flippo's Autobahn articles from The German Way and More.\nSee what facilities are available at the 338 gas stations, 382 service areas, and 51 hotels on Germany's Autobahn network.\nDeTraci Regula's article is at Tripsavvy.com.\nUse the journey planner to design an itinerary or check traffic conditions at the official Italian motorway site, where you'll also find a handful of articles in English.\nJoseph F. Lomax wrote this article for InItaly.com.\nLearn basic rules, regulations, and other facts from Portugal-info.net.\nMost of this advice from Andalucia.com is applicable to Spain as a whole.\nThis article is from our Switzerland for Visitors subsite.\nThe country's national tourist office tells everything you need to know before hitting the road in Britain.\nABOVE: You can drive a VW Touareg on the off-road course at Volkswagen's Autostadt in Wolfsburg, Germany.\nUse the \"Driving Directions\" form to plan your trip, or request an online map from the ViaMichelin database.\nRenault has been in the tourist car-lease business since 1954. It offers a full range of vehicles, from subcompacts like the Dacia and Clio to the Espace 7-seat luxury crossover and the Trafic 9-seat van. GPS is standard on all models.\nPeugeot is represented by our partner, Auto Europe.

    "text": "Home/Residential, Technology/August 1 is World Wide Web Day!\nWeb browsing and many other online activities we take for granted today wouldn't have been possible without the invention of the World Wide Web.\nIt\u2019s difficult to get one\u2019s arms around just how impactful the arrival of \u201cthe internet\u201d was for people all around the world. And it\u2019s amazing to think how relatively young this technology is, considering its extraordinary role in changing how the world communicates.\nWe put \u201cinternet\u201d in quotes because what many people think of as the internet actually refers to a few different things. Often, people confuse \u201cWi-Fi\u201d with the internet, although Wi-Fi refers only to an internet connection being broadcast over radio waves.\nAnother term that gets mixed up with internet is \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d but really the World Wide Web (aka \u201cThe Web\u201d) is a global information system that operates over the internet \u2013 much as email or Skype or Netflix do. What makes the Web so interesting and important is that it essentially made the internet a more user-friendly place where people could easily share ideas, photos, baby videos \u2013 you name it.\nSince August 1 is World Wide Web Day, we thought we\u2019d take note of some of the facts and history behind the Web.\nThe invention of the World Wide Web is credited to an English software engineer named Tim Berners-Lee. The son of parents who were among the very first computer scientists, Berners-Lee was working at CERN \u2014 a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland in the 1980s \u2014when he became frustrated by the fact that information on computers was hard to share. Plus, the information was often in different computer languages. There had to be a better way.\nIf all of that sound mostly like gobbledygook to you, that\u2019s OK. The point is, it worked, and worked so well that by the time the mid 1990s rolled around, businesses started to get the point that they needed to be on the World Wide Web just to compete. Everyone else soon followed.\nAdaptation to the Web was aided by the fact that CERN agreed to make the underlying code for the Web available without any royalty fees \u2014 essentially opening up the Web to anyone and everyone and fueling the rapid growth of the internet, the World Wide Web and just about anything else you can think of that requires an online connection.\nDespite the seeming ubiquity of internet access, there are still billions of people around the world who don\u2019t have a connection \u2014 reliable or otherwise. That need is what\u2019s driven Viasat to advance the availability of internet over satellite. Where cables and terrestrial wireless can\u2019t or won\u2019t go, satellite will, and it\u2019s increasingly clear that satellite will be the technology to take the Web to many of the places it couldn\u2019t go before.\nIf you want to know more about the World Wide Web, check out the book \u201cWeaving the Web\u201d by Berners-Lee himself.",

What IS this? :confused: My 'le hairs' are short and new, and on top of my head just like Martyna's\u2026they're not noticeable until you look closely, but this bothers me a bit.\nI have a few, and I found one on my husband recently. I think its normal to have different hair textures mixed in. I have a mix of fine and medium mostly, with some super coarse and super fine mixed in. Occationally I find those type 4 hairs mixed in but they don't worry me :P its these \"albino\" hairs I keep finding that bother me...... they seem to be growing in numbers lol!\nWhen I was a teen I had a weird \"le hair\" on the middle of my head, right at my forehead, it was thicker than dog hair and had a massive root with a diameter of a few mm. To this day I don't know what caused that to grow there. After pulling it out (it was too thick even for a fine toothed comb to pass over), it never grew back. I had a gaping little hole for a few weeks, though.\nI giggled at barbed wire fence.\nI'm 45 now with a section trying to be a cool stripe and some sparklies scattered about.\nYou have to be very close to notice the silvers.\nSo early invasion can be slow colonization as far as grey is concerned.\nTexture? I think that's so random. I joke that it's proof I should have been curly.\nAt 45, there's an age related texture shift possibility.\nI'm so relieved to hear that I'm not the only one. I started finding these in 2008, and they're super coarse, black and crinkly. 2-3x the width of the other hairs. I fried and dyed my hair for a few years straight, so I've never noticed how many there are, but now that I'm growing it out, I have at least 30% coverage of them. I'm brunette, at least, so it's harder to tell, but they're all JET BLACK and crinkly. They stand up in weird ways, too.",

    "text": "These days, Harbour View Hospital is full of activity. But it wasn\u2019t always that way.\nIn early 2016, Harbour View \u2013 a long-term care and rehabilitation facility in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia \u2013 came to the realization that change was needed to enhance quality of care.\nAt that time, it was felt that staff were working in silos and that interprofessional collaboration between staff could be improved.\nThe facility\u2019s diverse client population is served by an equally diverse multidisciplinary team that includes nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreation, social work, orthotics, hearing and speech, dietary, and others.\nBased on the perceived need to address problems with internal communication, Harbour View used funds from an innovation nursing grant to work on improving inter-professional collaboration on its rehabilitation unit.\nPart of the grant work included conducting a survey of all the clients in the rehab program. The survey asked clients what they felt could be improved at Harbour View.\nThe results were, in a word, surprising.\nResident Dennis Westin, centre, with niece Jen Boutilier and her partner Brittany Jones, enjoy some quality family time at Harbour View with their beloved pets.\n\u201cAll along, our focus had been on what we thought was an inter-professional role issue, so we were expecting feedback on that,\u201d says Angela Stairs, Director for Rehabilitation Services for the Nova Scotia Health Authority Eastern Zone.\nHowever, the overwhelming message was that clients wanted their families and loved ones to be more involved in their care.\n\u201cThe issue did end up being about communication \u2013 not between professions, but with clients and families,\u201d Angela explains. Families wanted more information on the day-to-day routine and treatment plans for their loved ones, and recommended that they be given more notice when clients were to be discharged. Clients and families alike also wanted flexible visiting hours.\nArmed with this information, one of Harbour View\u2019s first tasks was to do a full walk-about of the facility to identify areas for improvement in client-centred care. \u201cWe discovered right away that we had some challenges,\u201d says Lorna O\u2019Grady, manager of resident care for Harbour View site.\nThe building has a single entrance that splits off into two hallways: one leads to the long term care side of the facility, and the other to rehabilitation/restorative care. No signs were posted on the long term care side indicating what the visiting hours were, whereas the rehab side had signs posted at the building entrance saying that visitors were allowed in the rehab unit between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.\nIn March 2016, CFHI launched a pan-Canadian family presence e-collaborative initiative. The e-collaborative built on the work of the Better Together campaign and was designed to encourage organizations to examine and modify their family visiting policies.\nHarbour View began its participation in CFHI\u2019s 11-month e-collaborative in May 2016, along with 11 other sites from across Canada. Particularly valuable, according to Angela, were the regularly scheduled affinity calls that provided opportunities for all the organizations in the e-collaborative to share best practices and talk about solutions to common challenges.\nAlmost right away, Harbour View began to make some changes. They designed a new client and family information booklet and implemented revised visiting guidelines to include 24/7 visiting hours for families and loved ones. Education sessions and focus groups were delivered by former clients to give staff, families and clients an opportunity to ask questions and suggest improvements.\nAngela and Lorna admit that change is not always easy. There were some concerns expressed by clients, families and staff about issues such as privacy breaches and interruptions to treatment. \u201cSome worried that the floodgates would open and that families would be there all night, all day, potentially compromising the delivery of care,\u201d Angela explains.\nHowever, almost immediately it became clear that having family members present was helpful for everyone. Staff are now reporting that having an extra pair of hands and eyes helps to provide consistency in care, and is especially valuable when it comes to transitioning care from facility to home.\nHarbour View Hospital has seen lots of changes since implementing its 24/7 visiting hours. The recreation department, for example, has ensured that the facility is equipped with family-friendly activities such as a newly purchased a shuffleboard that is used daily by clients and their families. Family members are regularly attending care plan sessions and the facility is seeing many more visitors \u2013 of all ages \u2013 all day, every day.",

    "text": "Java might be the grandaddy of them all, but there are new kids on the block. Let's see what makes Scala and Kotlin great, frustrating, and how they compare to Java.\nSince the arrival and maturity of Kotlin, JVM-based languages face quite a challenge, most particularly Scala. You must have heard a lot about Kotlin by now, especially the perks and treats it brings to the Java table. But then there is Scala, a powerful and concise Java alternative. Scala vs Kotlin? Which one is better? Or maybe it's Kotlin vs. Java or Java vs. Scala?\nScala and Kotlin aim to better Java in their own different ways.\nTo those of you planning to shift from Java to either Kotlin or Scala (can't imagine it the other way around), I am going to paint a \"what's what\" scenario so you can decide better for yourself.\nLet's look at Kotlin first.\nKotlin was developed by JetBrains and reached the market in Feb. 2012 as an open source language. Up until now, Kotlin has had two released versions, with Kotlin 1.2 being the most stable version, released Nov. 28, 2017.\nThe language grew in popularity on Android because of its perfect compatibility with Java 6, which is mainly the present version of Java on Android. Not just that, Kotlin offers some features that are only in Java 8, and are thus not available to Android developers on Java 6.\nIn the closet full of 'All that is good about Kotlin,' the two most prominent qualities of Kotlin entail seamless and flawless interoperability with Java. You can call Java code from Kotlin and vice versa without any hiccups or frowns, not to mention the in-built null safety feature. Not seeing a NullPointerException is every Android programmer\u2019s dream.\nAndroid app development is completely transformed into a blissful, non-NPE experience. If you want some detail as to how the null safety works, check it out here.\nThat is also one of the 'why's' for Google adopting Kotlin on Android as an officially supported language.\nApart from that, take a look at some of the strengths Kotlin has to offer.\nAny Java competitor has to be an FP language. Kotlin lacks a little on the higher-kinded types and type safety, but nonetheless, it offers all the features of an OOP style language with an FP approach.\nThis is my favorite part. Java is great, but the boilerplate code it makes you write is just frustrating and error-prone. Coding in Kotlin is very short, concise, and to the point. Get the job done with fewer lines of code than in Java. The less you have to write, the less often you make errors and expose yourself to bugs. Everyone knows that, right?\nOne way Kotlin reduces the amount of code is by limiting the use of findViewById.\nKotlin allows views to be accessed from the layout XML, just like you would properties. Instead of using findViewById every time, all you have to do is follow this example.\nAlthough Kotlin is a younger language than Scala, it has the support of two great companies: the formidable Google and the amazing JetBrains, who are responsible for many other IDEs, including the IntelliJ IDE for Android. So there is no doubt about great tooling support there. To all the people who thought of Kotlin as some trend, you could not be more wrong.\nKotlin is already on Android and it is definitely here to stay, grow, and evolve.\nBut with strength comes some weakness as well.\nPattern matching is not strong in Kotlin. It doesn\u2019t fully support it.\n...that would be a no. But it's no frowner. You can still do a pretty fine pattern matching job by intelligently using the when clause. But we all know that intelligence takes a little more effort and skills than your average Joe.\nIf your applications are already long, then the extra runtime size of 800KB could be a problem for you. You might experience a dwindling number of downloads because of the bigger size of an application.\nNothing is ever all good. With the concise approach Kotlin offers, there is a little problem. With so much going on in so little code, it becomes a little hard to read and understand at first. It might even feel overwhelming to a beginner.\nAlthough Google has joined hands with JetBrains to offer support for Kotlin, it is pivotal to know that Google does not endorse it. Even when you use Kotlin in Android, the autocorrect occurs slower than it does for Java.\nAs I already mentioned, Kotlin is younger than Scala and, needless to say, Java.\nSince Kotlin is younger than Scala, it has fewer libraries, blog posts, and tutorials.\nThe online support community is quite small. The lack of blog posts, tutorials, and user documentation might become a problem for you, but as trends suggest, this might be filled up soon as more and more people and companies are adopting Kotlin.\nBefore you make up your mind, let's hop over to Scala.\nScala surfaced to the general public in the year 2004. Developed by Martin Odersky, Scala was released on the Java platform as a general-purpose programming language. The name Scala is not some whimsical notion, it is an abbreviation of \"scalable\": a language that is scalable according to the needs of its users.\nBeing released in 2004 sure gave Scala the advantage of maturing more over time and taking the spotlight from Kotlin.\nScala has some common features with Kotlin like conciseness of code, higher-order functions, FP functionality with an OOP style, and interoperability with Java (though not as good as Kotlin). Other than that, here is what Scala is about.\nPattern matching in Scala is no joke. Scala uses the match statement for this purpose, which is a powerful version of Java's switch statement. It allows you to match on any type of data, lists, and even your own types. If you haven't already tried it, I suggest you play around with it a little.\nScala is a little complex, but it has a very flexible code syntax. The proficient use of functional programming features makes the code extensible and hierarchical to the very best level.\nScala has been here for more than a decade. Since it is a powerful Java alternative, it has huge support community. We're talking about YouTube tutorials, blog posts, forums, and let's not forget the official support and user documentation. Anything you find yourself struggling with, you can pretty much find the answer to it.\nScala does not restrict you from overloading operators. You can play with operator-looking functions and define limitlessly. But you need to be careful with this feature. Still, if you can do this right, your code readability will increase. If not, you might end up making your code difficult to understand.\nEverything is about speed in the world of coding. A slow program is a big turn-off. When it comes to industry-grade projects, Scala's compile time turns into minutes as compared to Kotlin, which tries to compile as fast as Java, which is in seconds.\nScala is not binary compatible with a few versions. Let's say you compiled with Scala 2.1. The same will not compile with Scala 2.11.\nThat could be nothing, or it could be your biggest nightmare if you have to work across different versions and update them. Especially if you have production-scale projects.\nScala attempts a good take on managing null safety, but it's just not as effective. The Scala equivalent for null safety is the Option keyword. Using this, there is a considerable chance you might get an NPE at the back door.\nScala and Kotlin are in quite a tug of war. Scala has the edge over Kotlin in some ways, but Kotlin is just as formidable in others. The main differences \u2014 where the two languages set themselves apart \u2014 is that Kotlin is more like a better version of Java, while Scala is an entirely different kind of Java, so to speak.\nWhile Scala has a bit of a learning curve, it offers unparalleled support for advanced functional programming. Kotlin, on the other hand, is super easy to learn and fun to code in.\nBut does that mean something is wrong with Java? I mean why change from Java in the first place?\nJava is old. Really old. Like, great-grandpa old. And while popular, its popularity actually works against it. Java use is everywhere, which makes it impossible for teams using Java to change their fundamentals, even knowing that Java is facing a lot of technical criticism as well.\nNo matter the greatness, Java has too much redundancy and lengthy boilerplate code. Kotlin and Scala just happen to be better at what Java was intended for.\nChoosing the language primarily depends on the use you need it for. Scala is a good fit for projects with a need for a mix of functional and OOP style programming languages. For places where you need to handle large amounts of data or complex modeling reliant on mathematics, Scala would be best.\nHowever, if you just wanted Java to be less frustrating \u2014 but still be Java \u2014 then there is nothing better than Kotlin out there. Using Kotlin for Android app development will be the best thing that ever happened to you. Kotlin is like a Java cousin with better looks and who doesn\u2019t talk gibberish. So choose wisely and may the code-Force be with you.",

    "text": "1. Why choose shutters? Shutters bring style & sophistication to any window & are equally at home in both traditional & modern interiors. They last longer than curtains, as fabrics begin to break down as soon as they are exposed to sunlight, require periodic washing & harbour dust mites. Shutters offer a level of light control unmatched by any blind, as the louvres within each panel can be independently adjusted to temper the degree of light entering the room. If the sun is in your eye, you can simply close the louvres on one panel & let the light flood into the room though the others. On dark days, the panels can be folded back to expose the window & maximise the light.\n2. Why choose Made for Shade? We're the Midlands' longest established, most trusted shutter company & have been fitting shutters since 1999, so we know shutters inside out. Experience has taught us that clients generally want three things - the best product, at the best price, with the best service. (John Ruskin famously said that this combination was not achievable & that one of the three had to give - We prove otherwise!). Additionally, for your added peace of mind, we're full members of the Guild of Master Craftsmen (membership number A121256) - your guarantee of a top-quality product & installation.\n3. How does the quality of your shutters compare to that of your competitors? Our shutters are manufactured by the world-leader in shutter production, utilising a combination of state of the art manufacturing & hand-crafted finishing touches. The wood used for our hardwood shutters is stored for six months before kiln drying to allow the wood to settle before being treated. UNLIKE the majority of shutter manufacturers our wood is kiln dried twice in a computer controlled drying facility. The wood is specifically dried to take into account the climate of the country to which the shutters will be exported. This is very important as these shutters are manufactured for installation in climates as varied as Alaska & Australia. By utilising these methods, frame warping is greatly reduced. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we engineer our stiles (the vertical, side bars of the shutter panels), rather than producing these as solid profiles. We cut the wood into strips which are then bonded back together in opposing layers for greater strength. This has the effect of breaking the capillaries that run through the wood, through which moisture travels. This, together with the strength of the bonding agent, ensures our panels are unlikely to warp & will give customers years of enjoyment. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we use mortise & tenon joints between the cross rails and the side stiles. These are far stronger than dowel joints & minimise movement between profiles. Movement can result in cracking of the paint or stain finish, which will spoil the aesthetic appearance of the shutters. Again, just in case there is some movement, we engineer the panels with an additional grooved overlap that ensures any movement is handled by this expansion joint. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we use a high quality, proprietary paint system developed specifically for our shutters. Cheaper shutters use cheaper paints & stains and have fewer coats. We apply six coats of paint or stain, the final layer of which is a clear lacquer with a UV additive to ensure that the shutters are less susceptible to fading and yellowing. UNLIKE other manufacturers we don't compromise on the thickness of our louvres as we believe thinner louvres, although less costly to produce, are much more susceptible to warping. UNLIKE other manufacturers, we use the best quality, marine-grade stainless steel staples to attach our tilt rods to our shutters. In addition, the tips of the staples are coated in a bonding agent to make sure they remain secure for years to come. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we supply our shutters with a large choice of frames rather than attaching them to battens. Not only does this give you the choice of framing your window by selecting a frame design to co-ordinate with your decor, but it also offers a practical solution for awkward windows (inward opening, etc). UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we assemble our shutters prior to shipping to ensure that all the components fit together perfectly. Once photographed, the shutters are disassembled & packed into custom made packaging to ensure they arrive in perfect condition. When shipping by airfreight, we double pack the shutters for additional security. All this means we are able to provide a three-year warranty on all shutters built within our published specifications. There are inferior quality shutters available on the market, but why would you pay more to get less?\n4. Which areas do you cover? We're based in Sutton Coldfield & cover the West Midlands, East Midlands, Staffordshire, Warwickshire & Herefordshire regions. We also cover the 'M1 corridor' (the area between the M1 & the M40 between London & Birmingham).\n5. Do you actually make the shutters? Like 99% of UK shutter companies, the answer is 'no'. Made for Shade is the Midlands agent for our manufacturer S:Craft (based near Winchester), who are the shutter market leaders in terms of quality, choice & product innovation. Our expertise is in designing, surveying, specifying & installing shutters, not making them. This enables us to offer a far greater choice of materials, colours, louvre widths & framing options & guarantees clients a constant timeframe from ordering to installation. That said, we have joinery workshop facilities for customising special shutters & have been regular visitors to the factory where the shutters are manufactured. This means we can talk in detail about the production process & answer any questions you may have.\n6. Who will measure & fit my shutters? Made for Shade is a family business & as such, we don't employ sales people or believe in pressure selling. We operate a he / she who surveys also fits policy whenever possible, to maintain continuity throughout the order process. Acurate dimensions will be taken at the time of the design consultation to save disturbing you further. Our aim is to make the process of buying shutters a pleasure from start to finish & our testimonials certainly bare this out as you may have already seen.\n7. How long do I have to wait? Standard delivery time is between six & eight weeks. Special shapes take an additional two weeks, as CAD drawings need to be created & signed off before manufacture can commence. Custom coloured shutters also take an additional two weeks. However, if you need your shutters fitted sooner, we also offer an express service, which reduces the waiting time to between three & four weeks, but naturally costs a little more.\n8. How long do they take to fit? This really depends upon the size & quantity of the shutters & what they're being fitted to (wooden window frames are quicker to fit to than plastered reveals), however most jobs are completed within half a day. Naturally, we can give you an accurate time frame before you place your order.\n9. How are they fitted? All Made for Shade shutters are fitted using a three-sided or four-sided perimeter frame, from which the panels are then hinged. Frames can be fitted inside the recess, outside the recess or around the front edge of the recess, depending on how & where you want your panels to fold when open. Needless to say, there are different frame profiles for every eventuality. (The latter option is perfect for uneven recesses, as the run-out is hidden behind the frame moulding). Whichever framing option you choose, all screw-heads will be either hidden with insert strips or cap covers & in the case of stained finishes, screws will be fitted using brass or silver mounting cups. For wider installations such as patio doors & room dividers, tracking systems are used as they give constant support to the panels as they move. All panels are fitted within their frames using hinges with removable pins, which are perfect when it comes to decorating, as the panels can be simply removed & re-fitted in a matter of minutes.\n10. How & when do I pay? Payment is made in two parts, 50% when the order is placed & the remaining 50% on completion of installation. Payment can be made by cash, cheque, debit card or credit card (all major cards accepted).\n11. What are shutters made from? Made for Shade offer seven different shutter materials. The most economical option is Craftwood, which is a Polymer coated MDF product available in the six best selling white / cream shades & comes in a choice of four louvre widths. It's perfect for small to average sized installations & looked just like a wooden, painted shutter when fitted. We then have a variety of real timbers including Larchwood, Basswood & Cedarwood, each of which have their own unique grain patterns & characteristics. Using lighter weight timbers allows us to hinge more panels together to achieve greater widths with a single, conventional bi-folding shutter. Real timbers can have painted or stained finishes, but our Western Red Cedarwood can also be oiled to give it a beautifully natural finish, which brings out the individually different grain structure in each profile to give a truly rustic charm.\n12. How much light do they cut out? There are no technical figures to quote here but we estimate that a shutter will cut out 90 - 95% of incoming light. Whilst there are no gaps to let in direct light, there will always be light glow around the edges of the panels, between the louvres & between the louvre edges where they meet the stile uprights. If actual blackout is required for bedrooms, we have the perfect solution whereby a cellular pleated blackout blind is built into the shutter frame & positioned behind the panels. The blind is raised / lowered by a simple cord mechanism & cannot be seen through the panels. The blinds are available in several, equally effective colours, the most popular being white.\n13. Can they be fitted to any window? It's a rare day when we come across a window to which we can't fit shutters, but \"never say never\" as the saying goes. We need to ensure that the shutter will not inhibit the opening operation of the window & that we have suitably substantial fixing points to bare the weight, but this is all taken care of during the survey.\n14. What if my window is out of square? This is usually no problem as most windows vary in width & height across the window. If you want your shutters fitted inside the recess, the tolerance gap between the outside edge of the shutter frame & the recess itself, will usually be filled with decorating caulk as this can be painted to match the walls or window frame when dry. It takes approximately half an hour to caulk an average sizes shutter to a high standard, but makes all the difference in the world to the final result. If the window it drastically out of square, we would fill the gaps by scribing insert strips (finished in the same colour as the shutters) to the desired shape & then caulking around them as described earlier. Alternatively, we have framing options which can either be surface mounted outside the recess or fitted to the front edge of the recess with a lip feature that disguises / hides the recess variance. It's simply a case of using the right frame for the right job, which is where our expertise comes into play.\n15. What about shaped windows? No problem. We design & fit round shutters, arched shutters & angled shutters in various materials with either painted or stained finishes. The great thing about shaped shutters is that unlike blinds or curtains, they maintain the true shape of the window rather than \"squaring it off\" & the panels will still hinge open to give access to the window.\n16. What about high-level windows? If shutters are fitted to an out-of-reach window, the tilting of the louvers can be done by remote control (both battery & solar powered units are available). Alternatively, if the shutter is simply to dress the window, the louvers can be simply set in the desired position & left.\n17. How do I clean them? The easiest way is with either a feather duster or using a vacuum upholstery brush (the one with the bristles on). Marks can be removed using a damp cloth with, if necessary, a suitable soap solution.\n18. What if they get damaged? We offer a full repair service whereby, for example, damaged louvers can simply be removed & replaced with new ones.\n19. Does fitting make a mess? This depends on what we're fitting to as drilling into plaster / brick creates dust which drilling into wood doesn't. Whatever the case, we will always dust sheet the fitting area first & clean up thoroughly when we've finished. Installers also wear slippers in carpeted rooms. We are always mindful that we are in your home. We therefore treat your home as we would our own, with respect.\n20. What's the most popular colour? About 75% of our orders are for a white painted finished & there are good reasons for this. (1) White reflects light in a way no other colour will. This means light within the room is maximised as it reflects off the louvres (tip ~ using the medium 64mm or larger 89mm wide louvres also creates more light as the gaps between each louvre increase with louvre size & larger louvre surfaces reflect more light. Food for thought if you have a North facing room with a big tree outside!) (2) White never dates & always looks fresh. (3) White offers endless colour possibilities when it's time to decorate, as white will work with any colour. (4) White will always be relevant as there will always be something else white in the room (window frames, doors, radiators, coving, ceilings, etc). (5) Shutters are an investment in your home & will appeal to prospective, aspirational home buyers if you decide to move on. Buyers can always visualise working their design schemes around white shutters, as it gives them an open book decoratively speaking in addition to the wow factor.\n21. Are they guaranteed? Absolutely! All Made for Shade shutters are guarantee for a minimum of 3 years. This includes all aspect of the shutters (colour fastness & joinery) as well as the installation itself.\n22. Are they suitable for bathrooms & swimming pool areas? This really depends on the level of moisture within the air. In a large, well-ventilated bathroom with no shower, a conventional painted or stain finished shutter will be fine. However, in high moisture rooms such as shower rooms, wet-rooms & swimming pools, we have a purpose made waterproof product called Permawood, which an ABS coated hardwood. Permawood shutters are fitted with marine-grade stainless steel hinges to resist moisture & prevent rusting.\n23. How do I measure? To obtain an initial estimate, firstly decide whether you want your shutters to be fitted inside of outside the recess. Remember if they're fitted inside the recess, the panels will only fold back as far as the recess returns will allow (usually 90 degrees). If they're fitted outside the recess, the panels will fold back onto the walls (provided there is sufficient space for them to do so of course). For inside recess shutters, measure the width & drop in 3 places & tell us the largest dimension in each case. For outside recess shutters, take the same measurements & add 150mm to the recess width to allow for the overlap. If your window has a sill, add 75mm to the recess height or 150mm if it doesn't have a sill, to allow for the overlap. If you're looking to buy Caf\u00e9 Style shutters (to cover the lower part of the window only), take the width dimension in the same way, but then measure from the sill up to where you'd like the top of the shutters to be. For inside recess shutters or outside recess shutters where the window has a sill, that's the height you need to give. For outside recess, Caf\u00e9 Style shutters where the window has no sill, add 75mm to the recorded height. Naturally, we will take accurate dimensions at the point of survey but following this procedure will ensure there are no nasty surprises price-wise!\n24. What are \"Solid\" shutters? These are simply shutters, which have solid panels rather than louvred panels. They were originally fitted into period homes, folding back into purpose made side-recesses when the owners were in residence. When the owners were overseas, the shutters were closed for privacy & security as part of the \"closing up\" of the house. These days, we tend to only install solid shutters when either a greater degree of darkness is required or when replacing original solid shutters in period properties. Naturally, the amount of light entering the room can't be adjusted in the way it can with louvred shutters.\n25. Can I measure & fit my own shutters? Yes. We can measure & fit your shutters for you, we can measure but you can fit or you can measure & fit yourself. It really comes down to the complexity of the particular job & the surface to which the shutters will be fixed. If you're self-measuring, we suggest you e-mail a photograph of the window prior to finalising your order so we can try to spot any potential problems & help you overcome them.\n26. Do operate a 'price promise' pledge? Whilst our aim is to provide shutters at the most competitive price & we constantly monitor the market to check price levels, there may be times when, due to a limited or special promotion, a competitor's price is lower. In such an eventuality, we guarantee to price match any like-for-like, written quotation.\nIf you have a question other than those above, please either call us on 0121-352-0747 or e-mail it to us via our contact page & we'll answer your question by return.",

    "text": "From these definitions, you\u2019d assume that designing a website only encompasses pictures, text, and the layout of the pages of a website. Which technically is true. However, in today\u2019s world of search engine marketing (SEM), a pretty website is worthless if nobody finds it.\nYou need to do additional work to make the site optimized for ranking purposes and to drive traffic to it. Many make this a task to complete after the website design is complete. While that is certainly an option, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the best one.\nSlapping a website on the internet isn\u2019t enough for your online presence. You need to have the right keywords embedded into the site in order to start building your organic SEO. So why not do the required keyword research upfront during the design phase?\nWeb designers and SEO experts are sometimes at odds with their priorities. The goal of designers is to produce an aesthetically appealing site that communicates to visitors that they put great effort into the final product. SEO is not their priority. SEOs, however, tend to include code that is easily crawled, indexed, and understood by a search engine spider. It\u2019s focused on keywords but can be difficult to navigate and doesn\u2019t do a good job of lead conversion.\nSo what you need is a balancing act when it comes to creating a web design that is SEO-rich. Getting that result requires using a process to accomplish both goals (attractive and functional design AND keyword-rich optimization).\nBesides, even if the keyword stuffing did rank you higher and drive traffic to your site, do you really think that visitors would stay there long if they didn\u2019t find useful information?\nAn appropriate amount of time and effort should be allotted to keyword research. Choosing the right keywords for your business is crucial. Words or phrases that your target audience might include in queries to find your product or service need to be included in your web content strategically in a natural, relevant flow of content.\nWebsites need to be designed for use on multiple devices: laptops, tablets and mobile. Over 70% of internet searching is done via smart phones and that number will continue to grow. If your website isn\u2019t designed to be mobile-friendly, it will be penalized, not only by the search engines but by prospective customers. Google rewards mobile-friendly websites with higher organic SEO rankings. Users will not stay long if they can\u2019t navigate easily or see what they want on the site.\nIf you design the website from the get-go to automatically adjust for optimal display on all devices, you won\u2019t have to worry about it later on.\nThese are behind-the-scene items in the HTML code that can boost SEO for the website. Remember, great design is to help the people who make it to your site, but the code is to help the search engines get them there.\nThe header tags include an overall summary of the page for search engines to use for ranking without having to read the rest of the page content. Including keywords in the headers will further optimize the site and make the content more organized and easier to read and understand.\nA title tag is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. They are what appears in search results as a clickable link to the site. They should contain the primary keyword phrase, ideally at the beginning for best SEO results.\nSearch engines cannot scan images for keywords, so it\u2019s important to add a title for them and include alt text that incorporates keywords.\nNeed a Website that Will Get You Leads?\nIf you don\u2019t have a website at all, we can design you one that meets your specific business needs, includes SEO to get your ranked highly and will promote lead conversion. If you already have a website, let us run a complimentary SEO Report against it to show you how it ranks.",

    "text": "LightSquared and former FCC chief engineer Edmond Thomas on Wednesday said the GPS test devices that were used by the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Executive Committee (PNT EXCOM) to test its new network were rigged by \u201cmanufacturers of GPS receivers and government end users to produce bogus results.\u201d The company said that devices from GPS manufacturers, which have claimed LightSquared\u2019s network interferes with GPS communications, were \u201ccherry picked\u201d in secret and that independent authorities were not allowed to partake or oversee the tests or test results. In addition, LightSquared said the tests focused on obsolete technology that is only used in \u201cniche market devices\u201d and that are \u201cleast able to withstand potential interference\u201d from wireless networks. Read on for more.\nAfter a list of the test devices was released to LightSquared, the company found that the only mass market device that reportedly failed the government\u2019s tests actually \u201cperformed flawlessly during Technical Working Group\u201d testing. The government also reportedly tested LightSquared\u2019s network at a power level that is 32-times greater than the level at which it will actually operate.\nLightSquared is relying on FCC approval to solidify a contract with Sprint to help build out the carrier\u2019s 4G LTE network. Sprint most recently gave LightSquared an additional 30 days to gain FCC approval, but the government has said none of LightSquared\u2019s proposed fixes will help it gain approval.\n\u201cTransparency is the only way taxpayers can be assured that the testing process is not manipulated to benefit one particular set of self interests,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cLightSquared is confident that a fair process will allow the company to move forward with its plan to deliver wireless broadband to hundreds of millions of consumers.\u201d LightSquared\u2019s full press release follows below.\nRESTON, Va., January 18, 2012 \u2013 LightSquared said today that the process used to test GPS devices by Air Force Space Command on behalf of the Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee (PNT EXCOM) was rigged by manufacturers of GPS receivers and government end users to produce bogus results, and revealed details of the testing to document its accusations.\nPNT EXCOM advises and coordinates among U.S. government agencies on GPS matters and is comprised of representatives from those agencies with GPS expertise. LightSquared has called on the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to objectively re-evaluate this initial round of testing and also to evaluate mitigation proposals the company has proposed. Additionally, the company has called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the NTIA to conduct the second round of tests on high-precision devices at an independent laboratory to ensure objectivity and transparency.\nIn a call with reporters, Jeff Carlisle, LightSquared\u2019s Executive Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy; and Geoff Stearn, LightSquared\u2019s Vice President for Spectrum Development; outlined how GPS industry insiders and government end users manipulated the latest round of tests to generate biased results. Also on the call was Edmond Thomas, former chief engineer at the FCC who explained how fair and accurate testing should be conducted.\n1. Testing was shrouded in secrecy, no transparency. The GPS manufacturers cherry-picked the devices in secret without any independent oversight authority in place or input from LightSquared. The GPS manufacturers and the government end users put non-disclosure agreements in place for the PNT EXCOM\u2019s tests, preventing any input by an independent authority or from LightSquared before the tests began. This secrecy made it impossible for independent experts to properly oversee or challenge the process and results, thereby leaving taxpayers who paid for the testing no option but to take the PNT EXCOM\u2019s word for it.\n2. The testing protocol deliberately focused on obsolete and niche market devices that were least able to withstand potential interference. When LightSquared finally obtained a list of the devices tested, after all testing in this first phase of tests had been completed, it was able to determine that the testing included many discontinued or niche market devices with poor filters or no filters. The units tested represent less than one percent of the contemporary universe of GPS devices. In fact, the only mass market device alleged to \u201cfail\u201d during this round of testing performed flawlessly during the Technical Working Group testing, which used best practice protocols agreed to by all parties, thus raising doubts about the integrity of PNT EXCOM\u2019s process.\n3. The testing standard does not reflect reality. To guarantee favorable results, the PNT EXCOM selected an extremely conservative definition of failure \u2013 one dB of interference. Independent experts agree that a one dB threshold can only be detected in laboratory settings and has no impact on GPS positional accuracy or user experience. In fact, GPS devices are designed with the ability to withstand eight dB or more of loss of sensitivity due to man-caused and natural interference. By setting the definition of interference at one dB, the testing was rigged to ensure that most receivers would fail. It should be noted that PNT EXCOM and others have justified the one dB threshold by citing an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard. However, that standard explicitly states that it does not apply to general purpose GPS receivers.\nGPS and government end users should have opened the process for transparent review, chosen a representative sample of devices that reflect the scope of general purpose GPS receivers in the marketplace today, applied best practice standards to the testing protocol, and \u2013 most importantly, the tests should have been conducted by an independent laboratory rather than by the GPS manufacturers themselves, since they had a large incentive to ensure that the tested receivers would not pass the testing.\nWhy did the government choose to ignore LightSquared\u2019s proposed power levels?\nWhy did the government choose a power level 32 times greater than the level at which LightSquared will operate?\nWhy did the test protocol select the 1dB degradation to noise as the interference standard, since it does not apply to general purpose GPS receivers and GPS units are typically designed with an 8dB level of tolerance?\nWho determined what acceptable interference is for the current round of testing?\nWhy was the testing conducted using outdated/discontinued devices rather than a representative sample of what is currently in the market?\nIsn\u2019t it a violation of conflict of interest laws for representatives of GPS manufacturers to sit on the PNT advisory board and play a central role in its consideration of LightSquared when those companies are actively lobbying on the same issue?\nIs it fair that taxpayers funded a testing regime they cannot review?\nLightSquared has agreed to meet every technical guideline requested by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), FCC and NTIA and will continue to work in collaboration with the federal government to resolve the GPS interference issues. The secretive behavior of the PNT EXCOM indicates a co-opted process. The inappropriate influence of the private sector on their decision-making has been brought to the attention of NASA\u2019s Inspector General in a separate conflict of interest complaint filed by LightSquared.\nLightSquared is asking for fair and transparent oversight of the testing process by the FCC and NTIA, much like the agencies provided in the first round of testing that was openly agreed to by all parties. Transparency is the only way taxpayers can be assured that the testing process is not manipulated to benefit one particular set of self interests. LightSquared is confident that a fair process will allow the company to move forward with its plan to deliver wireless broadband to hundreds of millions of consumers.",

    "text": "With its beautiful beaches, it's no wonder so many tourists flock to Long Beach Island every summer and why so many never want to leave. I certainly understand the feeling, I've lived on Long Beach Island for over 20 years after spending my summers here as a child and it's why I love helping people buy or sell Long Beach Island NJ real estate.\nMy name is Laura Dunlap and for years I have helped people buy or sell homes right here in Long Beach Island.

And I make it my mission to get to know the people I work with as well as I know Long Beach Island, the place I know and have been calling home for most of my life. It is my in-depth knowledge of the Long Beach Island communities that makes me more than just a real estate agent, but a partner in helping people buy the house of their dreams or sell their existing property quickly and for the right price. For each of my clients, I promise to work hard, stay in touch, keep them informed, offer honest advice through the entire process, and negotiate the best deal possible.\nSo whether you're looking to buy or sell Long Beach Island NJ real estate, Manahawkin NJ real estate, or Beach Haven NJ real estate, I would love to help.

Contact me today to get started buying or selling Long Beach Island real estate.\nLong Beach Island is calling. Can you hear it? With the sound of every crashing wave, another memory is made\u2014another memory, in your new home in Long Beach Island.

    "text": "Today I will be reviewing Organic Harvest Anti Pigmentation Cream. I\u2019ve tested this product for good 2 months. Since I tested this Anti Pigmentation Cream fro Jan end, I can tell you how it fares in both seasons \u2013 summer and winter. Be ready for a detailed review of this product!\nFirst, a little background on my skin \u2013 I\u2019ve dry combination skin. My t-zone is super oily especially my nose and my cheeks & forehead usually run dry. My skin is super sensitive and acne & blemish prone. I am prone to cystic acne as well (will talk about how I conquered cystic acne in another post).\nP.S. Always keep in mind even if you & I have similar skin, what worked for me might not work for you.\nThe pure ingredients like organic daisy flowers extract have been integrated efficaciously to provide an even pigmentation and prevent melanin synthesis so effectively that you will have your skin turning visibly softer and glowing. A natural remedy for pigmented skin, age spot, blemishes, sunburn and tanned skin, this anti-pigmentation cream possesses the benefit of a full-fledged treatment, which clarifies the skin while averting the appearance of any future discoloration, thus, leaving the skin fresh and youthful.\nAqua, Organic Daisy Flower Extract, White Mulberry Extract and Vitamin \u2013 C in Cream base.\nI usually apply a moisturizer first on my cleansed face then apply this cream in night. Topped it with facial oil during winters. I don\u2019t apply it in day time (along with night time) as mentioned by brand cos\u2019 the product contains Vitamin C in it. Vitamin C makes skin sensitive to sun, even though I apply sunscreen I wanted to be on a safer side. The sun is anyway too harsh in India.\nMy first impression of this cream was that it felt dry & stretchy on my skin. It felt too stretchy in applying the cream as it finish in matte. Keep in mind it was during the Jan end, peak winter, when I tried it for the first time. So I started to apply facial oil after applying this cream. But during application it still felt stretchy so I started to apply a moisturizer before slathering this cream on. Since it was winter, I could get away with so much layering. No I didn\u2019t face any acne breakout.\nAfter a month\u2019s use, I did observe that my fresh acne scars (I had an acne breakout as a reaction to stage makeup) were fading very lightly. The appearance of lil\u2019 pores on my upper cheeks seemed to even out after applying the cream. But didn\u2019t see any effect of any sort on my previous acne spots and the discoloration. I know for a fact that anti pigmentation creams take time working on old scars and discoloration. So I was ready to be patient with it.\nAfter two month\u2019s of use of Organic Harvest Anti Pigmentation Cream, the fresh scars faded a lot. I noticed an overall brightening on face. But nothing on the discoloration around mouth areas (if it lessened, it\u2019s like barely noticeable). Old acne scars were still there with very very slight fading (it can also be cos\u2019 I started being somewhat consistent with my skincare). However, overall appearance of pores seemed to be better even in tropical hot March in India.\nFades new acne scars significantly in two month\u2019s time.\nPores seemed to look evened out.\nDoes give an overall brightening effect.\nNo to very very slight fading on old acne scars.\nNo effect on slight discoloration/pigmentation around mouth.\nDry skinned beauties might need a moisturizer along with it.\nGood for oily skinned beauties as it is mattifying.\nDoesn\u2019t clog pores nor does cause any acne breakout.\nDecent cream to use in night time.\nDisclaimer \u2013 The product was sent to me by PR for review purposes but the review is 100% honest. Real Girl Talks will always keep it real with you, there\u2019s no place for bs here!\nThat stuff sounds so good. I want to use it now.\nThanks for sharing babe! I suffer from pigmentation issues after acne scarring and definitely want to try this product out!\nGreat post, thanks for sharing. Sounds like a cool product!\nOMG this stuff sounds amazing! Need to try it!\nI\u2019m glad it worked partially for you \u2013 although it didn\u2019t work on older marks it\u2019s nice it worked on the newer ones. Definitely something you\u2019d have to consistently use to get the benefits from!\nGood to know it works in dealing with new acne scars. Thanks for sharing your review dear!\nThat is a not-so-bad rating at all. Lots of positive things said. Thanks for your honest review. Helps a lot.\nHappy Easter and Sunday to you beautiful.\nOmg this sounds sooo amazing!! I have terrible hyper-pigmentation, so this would be super handy!\ni need to try this! got so many red marks on my skin, and i love that it\u2019s organic!\nIt seems like it takes awhile, but with consistent use you will get results. Thanks for the honest review.\nI didn\u2019t even know there was anything like this out there!! Sounds wonderful!!\nThanks for the review. I never used anything like this before.\nThanks for your thoughts on this, babe! I love hearing about new products!\nI wish this scar lightener is available in the Philippines.\nI adore natural, paraben free cosmetics. This sounds really good!\nIt sounds like a great product, I\u2019ll have to check it out! Thanks for sharing!\nSounds like something my oily skin would like. I have had the same experience with Vitamin C products, they work much better on fresh scars than on older ones. No clue why.\nI haven\u2019t heard of this brand before but this product sounds really nice, glad it helped with the overall brightening!\nMaybe I should try this product as I have some discolouration too. Thanks for the honest review!\nSounds like a great product hun! Thanks for the review.\nSounds like a decent cream and with a reasonable price tag too. Good that you saw some differences albeit small ones.",

    "text": "I have been busy baking Christmas cookies for the last couple of days. This is one of the first ones I did. It is a butter sugar cookie that you can flavor anyway you like and color anyway you like. I had intended to make these redder than they are but after about 10 drops of food coloring in them I decided that was enough. When I make these again I will use paste food coloring to get a deeper more intense color like a Christmas red. I like pink and green together so it worked for me. Store these in an airtight container and they should last for days.\nConfused as to what type of butter, shortening or margarine to use and does it make a difference? You bet it does. Vegetable shortening, margarine and butter in some recipes are interchangeable. Ask most experienced bakers, though, and they will tell you that one of their secret weapons is plain, pure butter. Butter serves several purposes in cookie baking, it tenderizes and conveys the flavor of the cookie.\nCompare the difference between a shortbread cookie and that of biscotti. Shortbread cookies seem to almost melt in your mouth, where as biscotti has a much lower butter content and are hard and crunchy. If a cookie recipe calls for butter, I\u2019d use the butter, especially in cookies where butter is the flavor of the cookie. On the other hand cookies such as Molasses or gingerbread, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use shortening. Do not use \u201creduced fat\u201d or whipped butter products when you bake cookies, they can contain up to 58% water.\nYou want the cookies to spread more: Use all butter or add 1 to 2 tablespoons liquid (water, milk or cream) or use a low-protein flour such as bleached all-purpose (but not one that is chlorinated) or add 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar.\nYou want the cookies to spread less: Cut the sugar by a few tablespoons or add 1/4-1/2 cup additional flour.\nYou want the cookies to have a chewy quality: Melt the butter instead of simply using it at room temperature.\nBrightly colored Christmas Pinwheel Cookies are perfect on the holiday cookie tray.\nIn your mixer bowl combine butter and powdered sugar. When combined add the egg and flavoring.\nAdd the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix well. Divide dough in half.\nAdd food coloring of choice to each half. Fold the dough over and over until it is mixed in.\nTake a tablespoon of each dough and put together to form a ball. Roll the dough into a long snake about 6 inches long. Starting at one end roll the dough into a cylinder. Dip the edges into the sprinkles and place on a greased baking sheet.\nBake for about 8 minutes. Do not overbake. Let set on cookie sheet for about 5 minutes when the cookies come out of the oven. Remove to a wire rack to cool.\nWould you like to try another recipe?",

    "text": "When Cait and I found out how easy it is to make ravioli\u2013and with such completely impressive and delicious results!\u2013we just had to share this fabulous harvest recipe with you.\nThis dish is a poem to autumn, filled with sweet, tender butternut squash combined with a touch of honey, fresh thyme, rosemary, sage, and Parmesan, and topped with chopped hazelnuts (or you could substitute walnuts) and brown butter. This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997).",

    "text": "Notice: This is an old thread. The last post was 2737 days ago. If your post is not directly related to this discussion please consider making a new thread.\nEvery researcher or diagnostician working with reptiles has faced the challenge of identifying reptile hemoparasites and then determining whether they are of importance or merely incidental. Another challenge is how to easily find the information required to make the proper identification. A distillation of knowledge from world-renowned expert Sam R. Telford, Jr, Hemoparasites of the Reptilia: Color Atlas and Text provides a comprehensive compilation of information on how to differentiate between the myriad species of reptile hemoparasites.\nThe atlas provides diagnoses for 262 species of plasmodiids, hemogregarines, hemococcidians, trypansosomes, and leishmanias, including descriptions of eight new species or new taxonomic designations. It also discusses lesser known groups, such as piroplasms, rickettsiae, chlamydia, and erythrocytic viruses. Each genus and many species are represented among the 166 taxa illustrated in color. The species accounts contain host and geographic distribution, with precise localities when possible, prevalence, life cycles and vectors when known, effects upon the host, and ecology of the host-parasite relationship, morphological variation, and an exhaustive bibliography. The book also includes an illustrated key showing diagnostic characters.\nTelford draws on his 45 years of experience and his personal collection, considered the world\u2019s most complete, to provide information on the morphology of the unicellular parasites of reptilian blood. He includes information from hard-to-find original papers and articles from sources throughout the world. The illustrated key and photomicrographs from Telford\u2019s collection make identifying species quicker and easier.\nLast edited by Motoko; 6th September 2012 at 07:09 PM.

    "text": "This is a model of an RhB (Rhaetian Railroad) class ABe 8/12 \"Allegra\" powered rail car train. The paint and lettering are prototypical for Era VI. The model has traction tires and is driven on four wheelsets by two ball bearing B\u00fchler motors. It has an mfx/DCC sound decoder with many sound and light functions. The pantographs can be raised and lowered digitally on both end cars. All the cars on the train have metal wheels, and the center car has wheelsets with ball bearings. All the doors can be opened. The model has many separately applied details such as conductors, plugs, windshield wipers, antennas, and rear-view mirrors. The model has sprung buffers and complete rail clearance devices (the center part of the rail clearance devices can be replaced with a standard LGB coupler that is included with the train). Length over the buffers 206 cm / 81-1/8\".\nLGB 22225 \u2013 RhB Class ABe 8/12 \"Allegra\" Powered Rail Car Train On October 14, 2009, the Rhaetian Railroad (RhB) set a new milestone in its tradition-filled history, because the first of 15 new three-part dual system powered rail car trains (11 kilovolts /16.7 Hertz and 1 kilovolt DC), the class \"ALLEGRA\", was festively received on this day in Landquart. The new train is not only highly modern, but it also conceals significant innovations and a lot of power inside. All the wheelsets are powered in both end cars. The multi-system drive equipment consists of 4 drive trains with water-cooled IGBT rectifiers and produces 2.6 megawatts / 3,485 horsepower with AC voltage (2.4 megawatts / 3,217 horsepower with 1 kilovolt DC). That is extremely high because the most powerful RhB locomotive, the high-performance class Ge 4/4 III, offers \"only\" 3.1 megawatts / 4,155 horsepower of performance. With 8 powered wheelsets and its performance, the \"ALLEGRA\" develops a correspondingly high tractive effort of 260 kilo newton / 58,450 pound-force, which exceeds that of the Ge 4/4 III by 30%. With it, the builder Stadler succeeded in creating a unique meter gauge powered rail car train in the entire world in terms of power density, performance, and weight. One special challenge here was to \"stow\" the power packets in the limited space beneath the powered rail car floor and on the roof, which also succeeded thanks to innovative solutions. The non-powered intermediate car offers comfortable entry with its depressed floor area, a handicap-accessible toilet, and storage space for baby strollers. There is space in the class ABe 8/12 with its fully air conditioned passenger areas for 24 seats in 1st class and 76 seats in 2nd class as well as additional fold-down seats and standing room. A modern passenger information system with flat screens is also standard. The ends of the powered rail car trains with the Grisons canton coat-of-arms lends the lower part of the cab with its shape coming to a point and the straight cab windows arching to the back a certain sharp edged look and it also symbolizes its power. The \"ALLEGRA\" can also claim a speed record for meter gauge trains because on December 20, 2010 unit 3502 reached a proud 145 km/h / 91 mph on a special run in the Vereina Tunnel.",

Recently on Wednesday June 6, 2012 YouthBuild Just-A-Start was featured in a YouthBuild USA film screening, \"Building Career Opportunities in Healthcare\". The film captures current participants and alumni from YouthBuild Just-A-Start as they explore and pursue career pathways withing the health care industry. Developing pathways to health care related careers has been recognized by YouthBuild USA as a best practice for creating promising futures for our young people. While construction training remains a key component of YouthBuild programs, YouthBuild Just-A-Start remains open to an ever changing workforce environment. We are so proud of the YouthBuild Just-A-Start students and look forward to hearing about their future success. Please take a moment to view the short film below.\nAs the Massachusetts YouthBuild Coalition continues its mission to empower underserved young people through advocacy, resource development, peer evaluation, and support, the students and staff took some time to say thank you in appreciation of public officials who have provided both financial and moral support to YouthBuild programs over the past sixteen years. This was accomplished by landscaping the State House front lawn.\nOn Wednesday May 23rd, students and staff from six Massachusetts YouthBuild programs gathered to volunteer their service. This group committed to the landscaping project for the fourth consecutive year by planting red and white geranium flowers and impatiens. They also assisted with pruning of tree shrubs and bushes.\nDuring the lunch hour Congressman William Keating, came out to visit with the students. They had a chance to introduce themselves and inform Congressman Keating of what projects they have been working on. To wrap up the day, YouthBuild students made their way into the State House to meet with, among others, Senator Eileen Donoghue of Lowell who has been a strong supporter of YouthBuild.\nThis was a wonderful experience and there was a great turn out. Members of the State House staff were proud see young people and adult supervisors working together to take care of the property. The students proved that they were ready to be the difference by taking a step forward and making things happen. The work at the State house showed initiative and that our youth care. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "Where should routes be defined?\nBootPHP provides a very powerful routing system. In essence, routes provide an interface between the urls and your controllers and actions. With the correct routes you could make almost any url scheme correspond to almost any arrangement of controllers, and you could change one without impacting the other.\nAs mentioned in the Request Flow section, a request is handled by the Request class, which will look for a matching Route and load the appropriate controller to handle that request.\nIt is important to understand that routes are matched in the order they are added, and as soon as a URL matches a route, routing is essentially \"stopped\" and the remaining routes are never tried. Because the default route matches almost anything, including an empty url, new routes must be place before it.\nThe default route is simply provided as a sample, you can remove it and replace it with your own routes.\nSo this creates a route with the name default that will match urls in the format of (<controller>(/<action>(/<id>))).\nLet's take a closer look at each of the parameters of Route::set, which are `name`, `uri`, and an optional array `regex`.\nThe name of the route must be a unique string. If it is not it will overwrite the older route with the same name. The name is used for creating urls by reverse routing, or checking which route was matched.\nThe uri is a string that represents the format of urls that should be matched. The tokens surrounded with `<>` are keys and anything surrounded with `()` are optional parts of the uri. In BootPHP routes, any character is allowed and treated literally aside from `()<>`. The `/` has no meaning besides being a character that must match in the uri. Usually the `/` is used as a static seperator but as long as the regex makes sense, there are no restrictions to how you can format your routes.\nLets look at the default route again, the uri is `((/(/)))`. We have three keys or params: controller, action, and id. In this case, the entire uri is optional, so a blank uri would match and the default controller and action (set by defaults(), covered below) would be assumed resulting in the `Controller_Welcome` class being loaded and the `action_index` method being called to handle the request.\nController - The controller that the request should execute.\nAction - The action method to call.\nThe BootPHP route system uses perl compatible regular expressions in its matching process. By default each key (surrounded by `<>`) will match `[^/.,;?\\n]++` (or in english: anything that is not a slash, period, comma, semicolon, question mark, or newline). You can define your own patterns for each key by passing an associative array of keys and patterns as an additional third argument to Route::set.\nIn this example, we have controllers in two directories, admin and affiliate. Because this route will only match urls that begin with admin or affiliate, the default route would still work for controllers in classes/controller.\nYou can also use a less restrictive regex to match unlimited parameters, or to ignore overflow in a route. In this example, the url foobar/baz/and-anything/else_that/is-on-the/url would be routed to Controller_Foobar::action_baz() and the \"stuff\" parameter would be \"and-anything/else_that/is-on-the/url\". If you wanted to use this for unlimited parameters, you could explode it, or you just ignore the overflow.\nIf a key in a route is optional (or not present in the route), you can provide a default value for that key by passing an associated array of keys and default values to Route::defaults, chained after your Route::set. This can be useful to provide a default controller or action for your site, among other things.\nThe `controller` and `action` key must always have a value, so they either need to be required in your route (not inside of parentheses) or have a default value provided.\nIn the default route, all the keys are optional, and the controller and action are given a default. If we called an empty url, the defaults would fill in and `Controller_Welcome::action_index()` would be called. If we called `foobar` then only the default for action would be used, so it would call `Controller_Foobar::action_index()` and finally, if we called `foobar/baz` then neither default would be used and `Controller_Foobar::action_baz()` would be called.\nYou can also use defaults to set a key that isn't in the route at all.\nAs you can see in the below route, the reverse uri parameter might not make sense.\n* You don't like slashes?\nThe Request::param method takes an optional second argument to specify a default return value in case the key is not set by the route. If no arguments are given, all keys are returned as an associative array. In addition, `action`, `controller` and `directory` are not accessible via Request::param().\nIf a url matches the route, then `Controller_Ads::index()` will be called. You can access the parameters by using the `param()` method of the controller's Request. Remember to define a default value (via the second, optional parameter of Request::param) if you didn't in `->defaults()`.\nThe established convention is to either place your custom routes in the `MODPATH//init.php` file of your module if the routes belong to a module, or simply insert them into the `APPPATH/bootstrap.php` file (be sure to put them above the default route) if they are specific to the application. Of course, nothing stops you from including them from an external file, or even generating them dynamically.\nLet's say you decided later to make that route definition more verbose by changing it to `feeds/<user_id>(/).`. If you wrote your code with the above uri generation method you wouldn't have to change a single line! When a part of the uri is enclosed in parentheses and specifies a key for which there in no value provided for uri generation and no default value specified in the route, then that part will be removed from the uri. An example of this is the `(/)` part of the default route; this will not be included in the generated uri if an id is not provided.",

    "text": "You guys, I am so behind!\nI\u2019ve had Amazon Prime for years, but I used it primarily (pun, sorry) for the free shipping, video streaming, Kindle Lending, and Prime Day sales.\nBut I was totally missing out!\nDid you know about Prime Reading? You probably do. As I said, I\u2019m behind. I recently went camping and wanted to load up my Kindle with things to read by the fire. While I was browsing, I came across this new-to-me-but maybe-not-to-the-rest-of-the-world feature and about danced a jig.\nTons of free things to read! I loaded up and took my devices to the mountains. There\u2019s nothing like relaxing by a fire in total darkness with a nice book to read.\nThe fire where actual Prime Reading took place.\nOkay, now back to Prime Reading itself. If you\u2019re already a member of the Amazon Prime program, it\u2019s included at no additional charge (unlike the Kindle Unlimited program). You don\u2019t even have to own a Kindle. All you need is a device of your choosing and the free reading apps.\nBoom! You get access to tons of books and magazines. And they are actually items you\u2019d want to read! Seriously, go look. You\u2019ll find something to enjoy or mock (whatever suits you).\nChoose your books or magazines from the Prime Reading selection.\nWhen you\u2019re done, return the item.\nYou can check out 10 items at a time! TEN!\nEven if you hate the book, you\u2019re not losing any money. It\u2019s risk-free reading from your couch. No trip to the library needed.\nI didn\u2019t know about Prime Reading, but it makes me much more willing to pay the new, higher price. And it makes me wonder what else I\u2019m missing out on.\nSo are you already using Prime Reading? If so, what should I check out next? Or are you just as behind as me?\nI\u2019m so behind also! I think I used it once last year but was confused and thought it was Kindle Unlimited. I saw the 10 books thing but didn\u2019t understand when I couldn\u2019t check out another book (which was the K-unlimited) I still probably haven\u2019t returned that first book! Ha!\nThat\u2019s exactly what I thought! I didn\u2019t know Prime Reading was a different thing. I morphed it with Kindle Unlimited and the Kindle Owner\u2019s Lending Library. There are so many ways to get lots of books for a good price!",

    "text": "Cornerstone Kansas City\u2019s Director of Client Services, Lisa Bruemmer writes about the critical importance of in-person meetings during the Executive Search recruiting and hiring process.\nDoes it make a sound? I guess that depends on if anyone is listening.\nI recently read an article on Thrive Global, If You Do This, You Will Have Better Relationships, by Mareo McCracken and it got me thinking. Does the continual striving to be heard make sense if nobody is listening?\nListening is a skill. An art. It requires practice and focus to do it well. The payoff for honing our listening skills is huge both personally and professionally so why aren\u2019t we better at it? I think the answer is simple but difficult to overcome. Most of us are much more concerned about being heard. Our communication has become automated and one-sided as we become reliant on our cell phones, text, email, twitter, Instagram, facebook, etc. to tell, sell, inform and connect. Everyone is talking which begs the question, who is listening?\nProfessional and personal relationships require good listening. A resume doesn\u2019t tell you who a candidate is only what they\u2019ve done and an email can\u2019t convey what the hiring manager is like to work with or the culture of a business. So, I recommend you take that old school, face-to-face meeting whenever you can. Cornerstone Kansas City is listening.",

    "text": "The integrated program is the choice for those who want an immediate professional pilot career. This is a complete course to an Airline Transport Pilot Licence.\nThe aim of the integrated is to train pilots to the proficiency level necessary for the issuance of a commercial pilot licence, multi-engine class rating, and Group 1 instrument rating. Additionally, it will prepare pilots to operate as single pilot in commercial air services, or as co-pilot on multi-crew, multi-engine aircraft in commercial air transportation services depending on the exit point of the program.\nThe program differs from modular programs by providing a continuous training aimed at achieving the final standards for which the trainee is enrolled. This allows for the early introduction of advanced Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Crew Resource Management (CRM), Multi-Crew Co-operation training (MCC) and Scenario Based Training (SBT) designed to achieve the final standard.\nThe courses are structured in such a way that one may achieve a Commercial Pilot Licence (A), Commercial Pilot Licence and Multi-Engine Instrument Rating (A/IR), or an Airline Transport Pilot Licence (A) upon completion of the required phases of training.\n10-36 months depending on exit phase.\nA few notes before you enrol.\nThe modular program is geared to those simply looking to learn to fly. Be it for an immediate professional pilot career, fun, or adding ratings such as instructing.\nHave you completed your commercial pilot license and find it tough to get more hours? Or simply looking for new skills and challenges. Getting your instructor rating will help you add hours to your log book for future endeavours, while gaining new insight into flight by teaching others.\nGround school is good for those looking to learn something new. Or those with a genuine career need for the knowledge. Contact us to signup or more details. Check out the Students portal for current schedules.",

    "text": "I once had a dog named Bear. He was a bit of a goofball. As with many dogs, he would eat almost anything. However, he developed a particular liking for the flavor of whipped cream. We bought the kind that was pressurized and thus made a particular sound when squirted from the can -- compressed air volumizing the whipped cream, making it fluffy.\nOne time a few months after Bear discovered his love of whipped cream, my mom left the door open when shaving her legs. Bear was in a room nearby, and when my mom started squirting shaving cream from the can, which produced that familiar sound, he came running in and started licking the shaving cream right off her legs.\nHabit learning can be summarized as the \u201cacquisition of associations between stimuli and responses;\u201d that is, our brains learning to associate causes and effects, enhancing certain neural pathways. To simplify things, let\u2019s just say the brain builds \u201croads\u201d between various memories, and the more these roads are travelled the easier they become to travel. The more you think something, the easier it is to think it again.6 This happens regardless of why you thought something or if it is correct or incorrect. For instance, being in a bad mood can cause us to have different morals than we\u2019d have when in a good mood.7 From the \u201cbad mood\u201d nodes of our brain, the easiest roads to travel are often those with \u201cbad\u201d morals.\nFurthermore, once these paths are created, our subconscious travels them whether we like it or not. They may even form new paths without us knowing -- shortcuts to feelings whose origins are then forgotten, the result of countless choices that we made sometime in the past.8 (I once had a friend who trimmed her nails to calm herself down. She picked up the habit by being calm, then trimming her nails). Even our emotions can manifest as these \u201cunconscious habits.\u201d 9 Let me say that again: our emotions can be habits whose origins we\u2019ve forgotten.\nNegative habits can compound themselves by leading to other negative habits, and pretty soon, you\u2019re on a downward spiral with no roads out (literally -- as long as \u201croad\u201d is synonymous with \u201cneural pathway,\u201d of course). When most of your thoughts are negative, you might exhibit symptoms of depression. When most of your thoughts are fearful, you might exhibit symptoms of anxiety.\nReplacing the destination of a well-traveled road can be effective as well (we might call this the \u201cbait and switch\u201d).14 For instance, one of the reasons video games are so appealing is because they provide social interaction combined with a challenge. These are both legitimate psychological needs, but it might be that video games aren\u2019t satisfying anymore. We can\u2019t simply replace them with reading a book -- reading isn\u2019t typically either social or challenging -- but we might replace it with a sport. When your brain feels the need for a challenging social activity, it will think video games. But before long, you can have it thinking soccer, and all the associated thoughts along with your new favorite sport.\nHabits are both physical as well as mental. Our brain learns from what we think -- consciously or subconsciously -- but we can build new roads for it to travel. Roads that lead to positive thought.\nJust don\u2019t get confused between the whipped cream and the shaving cream.\n1A. Earling, The Tetris Effect: Do computer games fry your brain?

However few can claim to have unbleached and unbromated flour, which is good to know since bleach and bromated flour have been linked to serious illnesses.\nThe difference at Blocks Pizza is the use of \u201cmother dough\u201d and in a way this dough has a life of its own, because it is leavened naturally for 48 to 72 hours. Owner Eugene Vittoni works the dough every few days, with flour and water to keep it fresh. Due to the leavening process time, you don\u2019t have that bloated feeling and it\u2019s easily digestible; in addition they support local farms so ingredients are all fresh. In fact they pride themselves on having no freezer or adding preservatives to their food.\nWe tried the pizza and it was just as advertised, it tasted fresh and no bloating or stuffy feeling afterwards.\nAt Blocks Pizza, slices are sold in blocks or rectangles which are then divided into 4 equal parts. Prices range from $3.00 to $5.00 per block, depending on the toppings. Other notable differences include their infused garlic, rosemary, jalape\u00f1o or plain olive oils; which they offer instead of your typical shredded parmesan, spices of oregano or chile.\nWe did not get a chance to try their calzones or their pizza pockets, but they have been trending on social media and certain they are worth a try.\nNote: Depending on the time or day, parking may be a little difficult so go at a leisurely pace.\nVisit Blocks Pizza Deli and tell them that you heard about them on GreatFoodList.com!\nNOTE: Greatfoodlist.com features the best of local eateries and culinary events in south florida!",

    "text": "That transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming fall issue \u2014 one that will make it, Ms. Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.\nMixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts \u2014 what Ms. Rowe called \u201cour crowd sourcing\u201d \u2014 were invited to post their signed comments on the Web site MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterly\u2019s editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out Sept. 17.\nThe Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialized experts.\nToday a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.\nThe quarterly\u2019s experiment has so far inspired at least one other journal \u2014 Postmedieval \u2014 to plan a similar trial for next year.\nJust a few years ago these sorts of developments would have been unthinkable, said Dan Cohen, director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. \u201cSerious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy \u2014 as they have existed for decades, even centuries \u2014 aren\u2019t becoming obsolete,\u201d he said.\nEach type of review has benefits and drawbacks.\nThe traditional method, in which independent experts evaluate a submission, often under a veil of anonymity, can take months, even years.\nClubby exclusiveness, sloppy editing and fraud have all marred peer review on occasion. Anonymity can help prevent personal bias, but it can also make reviewers less accountable; exclusiveness can help ensure quality control but can also narrow the range of feedback and participants. Open review more closely resembles Wikipedia behind the scenes, where anyone with an interest can post a comment. This open-door policy has made Wikipedia, on balance, a crucial reference resource.\nMs. Rowe said the goal is not necessarily to replace peer review but to use other, more open methods as well.\nIn some respects scientists and economists who have created online repositories for unpublished working papers, like repec.org, have more quickly adapted to digital life. Just this month, mathematicians used blogs and wikis to evaluate a supposed mathematical proof in the space of a week \u2014 the scholarly equivalent of warp speed.\nIn the humanities, in which the monograph has been king, there is more inertia. \u201cWe have never done it that way before,\u201d should be academia\u2019s motto, said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a professor of media studies at Pomona College.\nMs. Fitzpatrick was a founder of the MediaCommons network in 2007. She posted chapters of her own book \u201cPlanned Obsolescence\u201d on the site, and she used the comments readers provided to revise the manuscript for NYU Press. She also included the project in the package she presented to the committee that promoted her to full professor this year.\nMany professors, of course, are wary of turning peer review into an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-like competition. They question whether people would be as frank in public, and they worry that comments would be short and episodic, rather than comprehensive and conceptual, and that know-nothings would predominate.\nAfter all, the development of peer review was an outgrowth of the professionalization of disciplines from mathematics to history \u2014 a way of keeping eager but uninformed amateurs out.\n\u201cKnowledge is not democratic,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Lamont, a Harvard sociologist who analyzes peer review in her 2009 book, \u201cHow Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment.\u201d Evaluating originality and intellectual significance, she said, can be done only by those who are expert in a field.\nThe most daunting obstacle to opening up the process is that peer-review publishing is the path to a job and tenure, and no would-be professor wants to be the academic canary in the coal mine.\nAlthough initially cautious, Mr. Galey said he is now \u201centirely won over by the open peer review model.\u201d The comments were more extensive and more insightful, he said, than he otherwise would have received on his essay, which discusses Shakespeare in the context of information theory.\nAdvocates of more open reviewing, like Mr. Cohen at George Mason argue that other important scholarly values besides quality control \u2014 for example, generating discussion, improving works in progress and sharing information rapidly \u2014 are given short shrift under the current system.\n\u201cThere is an ethical imperative to share information,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who regularly posts his work online, where he said thousands read it. Engaging people in different disciplines and from outside academia has made his scholarship better, he said.",

    "text": "History: The Deviants (or DV8) are descendants of Team 7, the covert military strikeforce who were exposed to mutational chemical compounds by the intelligence community in order to make them superhuman. The \u0093Gen-Factor\u0094 of superhumanity was passed on to Team 7\u0092s children. Those children therefore become International Operations\u0092 targets, as Team 7 had gone into hiding. Some of this children -- now in their mid-to-late teens -- were rescued by rogue I.O. chief and Team 7 man John Lynch, and became the group Gen-13.\nDV8 were not. They are fully the creatures of crazed I.O. Science director Ivana Baiul. Therefore, what we\u0092re looking at here is the antithesis of nice clean Gen-13. They stayed with IO. And they are not pleasant people.\nBrought together by the deliciously amoral Ivana Baiul, the group consisted of the heat-sucker Frostbite, the animalistic Evo, the multiple-personality possessor Copycat, the brawny Powerhaus, the density-altering Sublime, and the pain/pleasure controller Bliss. This motley group of disruptive teens was led by the arrogant psionic Threshold, with the utterly insane Sideways Bob acting as the team's \"keeper\". The group was formed and funded by Ivana once she was excised from International Operations to act as a \"spoiler force\", snatching up various technology and items before other intelligence agencies could get their hands on it, and then auctioning it to the highest bidder.\nWarren Ellis' opening run on the title was relentlessly nihilistic. The characters at no point seemed an amiable bunch, and with nary an altruistic gene among them. But Ellis' sharp writing and strong characterization made me interested to see if they'd discover a hint of humanity, a glimpse of promise, within themselves. For example, in the second issue Ivana sends them to investigate and possibly recruit a cult-like group of gen-active teens. When the DV8 members realize these people (with names like Virginia Dentata) are even more degenerate and twisted than themselves, they kill the lot of them - which of course was precisely what Ivana wanted in the first place.\nThe members slowly realize they exist to be manipulated. As one character puts it, they're \"like mushrooms, kept in the dark and fed crap.\" But it was fascinating to see how they each coped with their situation, particularly during \"downtime\". Sublime saves a girl from committing suicide by breaking her leg, Bliss begins a disturbing relationship with her brother Threshold, the ever-bored Evo wanders the streets seeking drugs to distract him. Not your basic \"hero\" behavior.",

    "text": "Communication Sites in SharePoint Online are now rolling out to a tenant near you. This is one of the larger releases from the SharePoint team recently and has been a point of focus since the Virtual Summit earlier this year. I personally have been looking forward to communication sites since hearing they were coming. As the modern experience in SharePoint Online continued to expand with team sites and group sites it felt like the publishing world was being left behind. Knowing that Microsoft is not only concentrating on the collaboration world of SharePoint but also the communication world, shows the future keeps looking better. SharePoint is already the king of corporate intranets and this release will make intranets easier and hopefully much better looking using the modern experience.\nWhat is a Communication Site in SharePoint Online?\nBelow is slide from one of Mark Kashman's recent slideshares about where the role of communication sites exists as compared to team sites.\nThe primary way to create a communication site is through the + Create Site button on the SharePoint landing page.\nOnce you click Create site you will now be prompted with type of site you want to create. In the past this would only allow you to create a team site. If you click create a team site the same prompt that you had prior will occur. Now we have what lies behind door number 2 which is the new communication site creation process.\nAfter you click create communication site you get a new site creation page. This page includes some cool new areas.\nStarting on the right you have your basic site name, address, and description.\nThe site address will auto populate but if you click the little pencil you can edit it. A good thing to notice here is that the sites are created under the /sites managed path. The site description will fill in the same site description as in classic sites.\nThen as we move down we see 2 new things. We now see site classification and usage guidelines.\nInterestingly enough, these are the options that are configurable within Azure AD for Office 365 Groups management.\nAnd last but not least we have a new choose your design section on the left.\nAs of initial release we have 2 preset designs of Topic and Showcase and then a blank design.\nI really like the idea of preset designs. I hope this is an area that will be opened up to allow new designs that you create to be added as communication site design templates.\nThe Topic and Showcase site designs are easy starting points to meet common needs and begin guiding page/content creation which is always a struggle for intranets. Both the Topic and the Showcase site design come preconfigured with web parts on the page.\nI am not sure of the technical reason for this but if you don't have the ability to create an Office 365 Group you won't be able to create a communication site. Even though you need this permission, an Office 365 Group is NOT created.\nAfter you clicked create, the actual process of creating the site was ridiculously fast. There is still quite a bit of work to do to personalize a site but the new web parts such as the hero and stream web part are great starting points for content delivery.\nI assume this will be resolved when the new admin portal comes out. For now if you want to see a list of your communication sites you will have to use PowerShell.\nThere is only 1 collection of navigation for top and left. This can be edited either in a library or on a site page. You can edit directly on these pages by clicking the edit link next to navigation.\nHere is some more support information for updating navigation. If you change the navigation it will be reflected on both the site pages and within the libraries and list pages.\nWith the release of communication sites we finally get more than single column page layouts. Personally I didn't think it was possible to create a super useful page in the modern framework without using more than 1 column so I think this is a huge improvement. This is also not just for communication sites but you can now have multi column layouts on all modern sites.\nNow if you are on a communication site and want to create a new page, the easiest way is through the + New option right below top navigation.\nThis is the kind of flexibility we have been needing for building pages in SharePoint Online within the modern experience.\nWhat else and what's next?\nCommunication sites are being rolled out to first release users and then full first release tenants. Worldwide rollout targeted for August 2017 and all of this includes the new web parts and sections layouts.\nThe publishing infrastructure continues to be supported.\nCommunication sites can support external users as long as the SharePoint site is configured to allow external sharing.\nMobile apps are being updated to support communication sites.\nJoin a communication sites AMA on Wednesday, June 28th 2017 from 9-10 a.m. PDT.",

    "text": "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly | I have but one voice.\nI read this quote by a respected leader I know, and I felt myself feel tension in my thoughts towards ideas like this.\nYou see, over the past year I\u2019ve been learning what it means to feel pain, to acknowledge hurt, to understand disappointment, and to allow myself to sit in those moments WITHOUT trying to see the positive side.\nI grew up believing and being taught to always see the positive, and not to dwell on the negative. That we must never be sad or angry or frustrated or discouraged for too long, because that would somehow be a reflection of a lack of faith. And while seeing the positive in all situations that doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like a bad thing, let me share with you how that impacted me as I developed into an adult.\nAs I got older, I found myself unable to relate with people when they were hurt or angry or upset or frustrated, because I had never allowed myself to feel those things. On top of not being able to relate, I found myself feeling impatient when someone couldn\u2019t \u201cpull themselves up\u201d or \u201csee the positive\u201d. I would spend my energy trying to convince them that everything happens for a reason and that God had plan.\nHere\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s not very comforting when you\u2019re in the midst of deep hurt or anger and someone tries to put a God-spin on it\u2026 when you\u2019re feeling very REAL, VALID emotions, and someone seems to not care and instead tries to force you into a happy place. Sometimes as Christians we can be pretty lousy friends. We\u2019ve trained ourselves to rebuke, to challenge, to resist, to persist\u2026. but what happened to sitting quietly next to someone in pain and allowing ourselves to enter into that with them? What happened to empathy, compassion, mercy, love, kindness, gentleness, patience\u2026? These were things that were sadly lacking in my interactions with people who were hurting.\nThankfully, God started opening my eyes to these things, and began showing me how to change the ways I interacted with those who were hurting. Instead of trying to find the solution, I let them cry, rage, vent, sit in silence, question\u2026. All the things we may need to do in order to release what we are feeling.\nHowever, there remained a missing link in my own story. While my response to those in pain changed significantly, internally I felt blocked off from them because I was having a difficult time relating to the feelings they were experiencing. I knew I had things in my life that should have made my angry and sad and hurt and traumatized\u2026 But I had never felt the emotion, and started to realize that wasn\u2019t healthy. For about 27 years of my life I didn\u2019t allow myself to feel the weight of those difficult emotions. I had it so engrained in my mind since childhood that those not-so-lovely emotions were bad, and therefore best kept hidden inside to never be seen by others. I didn\u2019t know what it looked like to express those emotions and not feel guilty about it.\nOnce again, God gently showed me the ways in which ignoring my own hurt was actually unhealthy. For being someone who aims to be genuine and authentic, there was a big, gaping hole when it came to my pain. I felt guilty to say I was upset, I felt ashamed to admit I\u2019ve had traumatic experiences in my past, and I felt fear of what people would think if they knew that alongside the deep, tremendous joy I have in Christ, there also lies mourning and sorrow for the difficult roads I\u2019ve walked.\nOne of the ways God revealed this missing link in my life was through loneliness. I started feeling like I wasn\u2019t fully known\u2026. that my friends were only my friends based off of the good things about me, and that if they truly knew the areas I was broken that they wouldn\u2019t see me the same way. But I came to a point where I realized that I\u2019d rather be fully me and know that I am being the most real, authentic version of myself I can be, than continue feeling like I am not fully known.\nSo I began letting people in. I started introducing more difficult truth into my vocabulary. I began taking steps towards healing and freedom through counseling.\nFor the first time, I\u2019ve heard friends use words like \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201ccourageous\u201d and \u201creal\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d and I\u2019ve believed them. You know why I\u2019ve believed them? I believe them because they have seen me cry. Not cute, sniffly teardrops\u2026. but full on snot-filled uncontrollable sobs that contain so much hurt and doubt and fear and shame and pain that I KNOW they have seen the true me. Boy have they seen the true me. They\u2019ve allowed me to recount painful memories. They\u2019ve allowed me to express intense emotions. They\u2019ve allowed me to question. They\u2019ve been silent when I needed a moment to process, spoken gently when I needed care, and encouraged boldly when I needed truth.\nNow these moments aren\u2019t shared with everyone. I\u2019ve chosen who I\u2019ve allowed myself to enter into these difficult emotions with, and in the right timing\u2026 but in those moments it\u2019s been transformational. My eyes have been opened and as tears have fallen, a weight has been lifted and new life has been given.\nAs I go back to this phrase, I come to this conclusion: As we train our minds to see the good, let\u2019s also train our minds to acknowledge the bad. We live in a fallen world, where sin and destruction are present. They affect our lives in very real ways, and ignoring them is an unhealthy way to react.\nHowever, we are not without hope! This process of me revisiting the hurt in my life has been anything but hopeless. In fact, the further I\u2019ve leaned in and wrestled with these things, the more I\u2019ve seen God at work. I\u2019ve experienced his love in entirely new depths. I\u2019ve understood his mercy in completely new ways. I\u2019ve relied on his gentle strength like never before. I\u2019ve seen my vulnerability breed authenticity in relationships. I\u2019ve felt the weight of my brokeness, but the beauty of his redemption.\nWe will never truly see the good if we can\u2019t acknowledge the bad.\nYou see, the more I understand pain and brokenness, the more I see God. Somehow, in the midst of this chaos of life, God has shattered every human understanding of cause and effect, and redefined the good that can come from the bad. It shouldn\u2019t make sense that as I acknowledge my hurt, I feel more joy\u2026 and yet that is exactly what God is doing in me!\nSo to all of this I say: embrace who you are. The ugly, messy, sinful parts, along with the beautiful, redeemed, gifted parts. Seek to be authentic, even in pain, and train your mind to know the truth of who God is and his heart to see redemption in His people. That is the good we can see in every situation, my friends.\nAnd now I leave you with this video clip of the movie/song I named this blog post after: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Random fun fact: I used to (ok, sometimes I still do) play a version of this song transcribed for piano and it was one of my favorites to play on piano.",

Of course, he still knocks back too much Jameson and dabbles in uppers, but he has a new woman in his life, a freshly bought apartment, and little sign of trouble on the horizon. Once again, trouble comes to him-this time in the form of a wealthy Frenchman who wants Jack to investigate the double-murder of his twin sons. Jack is meanwhile roped into looking after his girlfriend's nine-year-old son and is in for a shock with the appearance of a character out of his past. The plot is one big chess game, and all of the pieces seem to be moving at the behest of one dangerously mysterious player, a vigilante called \"Silence\"...because he's the last thing his victims will ever hear.\nThis is Ken Bruen at his most darkly humorous and most lovably bleak as he shows us the meaning behind a proverb of his own design-\"the Irish can abide almost anything save silence.\"",

In such a breathtaking outdoor setting, this d\u00e9cor just needed a few simple finishing touches to tie everything together. We added clear vases with sand and a few succulents, which really allowed the dark exposed wooden tables and vivid yellow accents to stand out.\nOne of the best aspects of this set-up was working with Mistine, who oversaw the weekend events for this group. It was truly a pleasure working with her, and we really want to thank Mistine for making us a part of this great corporate beach party.

    "text": "We are proud to offer you our latest product.\nThe Curcumin edition is the newest member of the DNH product family. After a year of development and testing it's finally available from the webshop.\nWhat is the reason for this product? Are the wonderful properties of CBD insufficient on their own?\nAs part of nature, CBD and Curcumin have a programme that is incomparable with anything else, CBD as highest in rank, but when it comes to attributed properties Curcumin is a good second. That\u2019s exactly why we call it the best of both worlds. Curcumin and CBD are in part, as regards effect and properties, aligned with each other and therefore increase the chance of making a valuable contribution to the well-being of humans and animals.\nThere are also properties attributed to Curcumin that provide a great deal of extra added value independently of CBD.\nWe opted for 30 ml and 50 ml packaging to draw individual attention to both products and to present these in the best possible way. As a result, the ratio CBD and Curcumin is 1 : 1 and this is the ratio that has been tested as best.\nThe Curcumin edition is also particularly suitable for preventative use, 10 drops in cup of tea, glass of water or juice gives you a dream start to the day! Whenever you could use a little help, we recommend the use of 10 drops at breakfast and 10 drops during the day, and do please feel welcome to let us know what it does for you!\nWe think this is the most wonderful product of all and the best supplement ever. What do you think?",

    "text": "It\u2019s never too early to consider protection of your intellectual property or to consider where things stand with your business as you start up or continue forward, grow, and mature.\nIt all starts with the conception of your idea and how you are going to implement it in your business. The next step is figuring out what exactly you have conceived. You may have heard this called an \u201cIP Audit,\u201d but really it is an overall evaluation of what you have, who owns it, and whether it is protected \u2014 or even worth protecting. Is it a patentable subject matter? Do you have a trademark, design, or know-how to be concerned about?\nAre there business interests in seeking protections?\nWhat are the best ways to use those resources?\nWhat are the chances of securing the protections?\nWhat\u2019s the potential for a pivot and would those protections be valuable if you go in a different direction?\nWhat are third parties doing and what are investors looking for?\nOnce you\u2019ve weighed these and other factors that may come up, you craft a plan, and put that plan into action. Then make sure to monitor that plan, keep track of any business, product, or service developments, and reflect on how they fit in with your plan \u2014 and address any concerns along the way. It\u2019s really an ongoing process.\nThe path from the conception of your idea to the protection of your intellectual property is a journey you should not take alone. Even the preliminary audit requires expert knowledge to ensure that you do not put all of your effort into a patent that may not be central to your business etc. A qualified intellectual property attorney can work with you throughout the process, from conception to potential enforcement.

The Buckeye offense backed him up with 13 hits to improve to a conference best 4-1.\nDeLucia, a junior from Columbus, Ohio (Bishop Watterson) pitched all nine inning and equaled a career high with nine strikeouts against three walks. He allowed just the one run on six hits to improve to 5-1 this season. His five wins lead the Big Ten.\nThe Buckeyes supported DeLucia\u2019s left arm with 13 hits and started the scoring in the first inning. It was the 15th game this season the Buckeyes had scored in the fifth inning. They have outscored their opponents 32-13 in the opening inning.\nOhio State scored twice in the bottom of the first inning to take the early 2-0 lead. Jonathan Zizzo (So., Youngstown, Ohio/Sarasota [Fla.]) led off the inning with a single to center field and went to second on a sacrifice bunt by Matt Angle (So., Whitehall, Ohio/Whitehall-Yearling). Zizzo went to third on fielder\u2019s choice by Eric Fryer (So., Reynoldsburg, Ohio/Reynoldsburg). That put runners at the corners for Ronnie Bourquin (Jr., Canton, Ohio/Canton South), who sent a ball to the right-field corner to plate both base runners.\nFryer launched his third home run of the season against the wind out to left field and gave Ohio State a 3-0 lead.\nIllinois (14-10, 2-3) got that run back in the top of the fifth inning on an RBI single down the left field line by Ryan Snowden. Ryan Hastings led off the inning with a single to left before a foul out and a ground out brought Snowden to the plate with Hastings at second. The Buckeyes (17-6, 4-1) turned a lead-off hit by Bourquin into their fourth run of the game. Jedidiah Stephen (Sr., Caldwell, Ohio/Shenandoah) singled through the left side to put runners at first and second. J.B. Shuck (Fr., Galion, Ohio/Galion) bunted both runners into scoring position before Bourquin scored on a ground out by Adam Schneider (Jr., Agoura Hills, Calif./Agoura) to give Ohio State a 4-1 lead.\nJason Zoeller (Jr., Verona, Pa./Shady Side Academy) finished 3-for-4 in the game, while Bourquin was 2-for-4 and drove in two runs. Angle, Fryer and Stephen had two hits and Fryer and Schneider added RBI.

    "text": "The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy \u2014 a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless.\nThese individuals and companies aren\u2019t entirely bad, of course, and they\u2019re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we\u2019ll want to go next or what songs we\u2019ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.\nLast week, for example, Salesforce.com introduced a new feature of its Chatter intra-company social network that categorizes a variety of data sources so employees can easily find the people, documents and other information relevant to topics they\u2019re interested in. As with similarly devised services \u2014 LinkedIn\u2019s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph \u2014 the new feature\u2019s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing.\nThe problem, however, comes when we\u2019re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses.\nCombined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data \u2014 personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it \u2014 these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they\u2019re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect.\nStatwing spells out statistics for laypeople.\nCan Tableau be data\u2019s George Washington?\nThis is why I\u2019m so excited about Tableau\u2019s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau\u2019s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I\u2019ve already referenced.\nAssuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound \u2014 it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free.\nTableau is already easy (I made this) \u2014 but not easy enough.\nThe bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it\u2019s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today\u2019s free users will be tomorrow\u2019s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users.\nAnd if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company\u2019s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That\u2019s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind.\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima.\nGreat article Derrick \u2013 appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm.\nWe\u2019re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible \u2013 and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that\u2019s missing from what I can see is the education \u2013 knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution \u2013 but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the \u2018how\u2019 to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I\u2019m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who\u2019s got that vision, I\u2019d love to hear it.\nI feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects.\nThis is a bit of a plug, but we\u2019re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a \u201csearch engine for data\u201d that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want.\nBy providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture.\nIn every company I\u2019ve worked at, I\u2019ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: \u201ca historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite\u201d. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data.\nIt took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these \u201cshadow IT\u201d projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores.\nAs for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride.\nOne good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we\u2019ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks.\nThanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that\u2019s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic.",

Natural disasters, maintenance issues, and even upset tenants can wreak havoc on your property. What you can control, however, is how you deal with these types of situations.\nAt RowCal, we know how critical it is that you maintain the ability to correct these situations. Before disaster strikes, you must proactively determine how to deal with it. Below are a few tips to help get you started.\nA reserve study is a critical budget planning tool that allows you to identify the state of your reserve fund. By performing a reserve study, you can determine how you should allocate funds so that you may respond effectively to unexpected situations. Your property management company can assist you with this process and help you determine how to distribute funding appropriately.\nTo ensure you have adequate insurance coverage, you should always conduct an annual review of your policy. Be aware of your deductible and review which occurrences your policy covers. Many standard insurance policies do not cover losses resulting from floods, and may even exclude sewer backups or sump pump failures. If your policy does not pay for damages from such events, you will need to purchase additional coverage to avoid paying out of pocket.\nIn the event of an emergency, you need to know who you can trust to fix the issue. Whether it\u2019s storm damage or major electrical outages, you will require general contracting services who will respond promptly. Your property management company should have a list of preferred vendors that they will contact in such situations. These companies are thoroughly vetted and have demonstrated professional, high-quality work. You should always know ahead of time who you will entrust with your repairs. Without a plan in place, you could fall victim to shoddy workmanship, or worse, an expensive scam artist.\nYou need an emergency preparedness plan, and RowCal is here to help you develop it. As an HOA management company, we specialize in financial administration, consulting services, and maintenance and project management. We are dedicated to improving your community\u2019s experience by resolving issues promptly and efficiently with your financials in mind.

    "text": "He and a neighbor managed to lure the horse toward them with a handful of grass, Sickinger said, and they even petted the horse for a bit. Sickinger had a strap he planned to use to bridle the horse, but he said better judgment took over and he decided the horse was too wild to control even if he could wrangle it.\nSickinger told a St. Clair County sheriff\u2019s deputy the horse might belong to a neighbor. There are several horse farms in the area, but none came forward as the owner, Sickinger said.\nMoments after Sickinger started petting the horse, a truck drove by and the horse followed after it. No one would see the horse until more than a week later.\nOn Wednesday, area resident Aranza Lee spotted the horse in a soybean field near Imbs Station and Wagner roads, less than a mile from Sickinger\u2019s home. She captured a video of the horse running freely through the field and shared it to the Millstadt News Facebook page. By Thursday afternoon, the post had more than 400 shares, but no one had come forward as the owner.\n\u201cI mean, how weird is that?\u201d said Sara Yoch of Smithton, a self-described horse-lover.\nLt. Alan Haake of the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the department has received several reports over the past three weeks about the missing horse, but he said no one has come forward as the owner, nor has anyone been able to catch it.\nYoch was out at the intersection of Otten and Wagner roads Thursday afternoon with a bucket of feed and a lead, looking for the horse. She said she was out in the same area Wednesday for about four hours, but didn\u2019t have any luck.\nShe warned area residents to avoid approaching the horse if they aren\u2019t familiar with how horses behave, and to slow down when driving through the area. Yoch said a horse standing in a road on a dark night can cause serious damage to a vehicle and hurt the driver, as well as the horse, of course.\nIt\u2019s possible the horse was dumped, according to Stephanie Goepfert, a member of the Lincoln Trail Riders in O\u2019Fallon. It can easily cost more than $500 a month to care for a horse, Goepfert said, and it\u2019s possible the owner could not afford to keep it.\nOn its own, the horse could get sick or injured, Goepfert added.\n\u201cThey can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they\u2019re a domesticated animal, they\u2019re relying on a certain diet. It can be bad for them,\u201d Goepfert said.\nThey can survive for a period of time in the wilderness, but if they\u2019re a domesticated animal, they\u2019re relying on a certain diet. It can be bad for them.\nThe most recent sign of the horse was a bedded-down area next to a creek near where the horse was spotted on Tuesday, Lee said.\nThere was no sign of the horse as of Thursday afternoon, though several groups were planning to head out and search for it.\nAnyone who spots the horse can call the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department at 618-207-4374.",

    "text": "This article aims to demonstrate how leggings are not a garment that can only be worn by one age bracket. By paying particular attention to how leg wear can be worn and with what other garments, it is the aim to support the fact that leggings can be worn by ladies of all ages.\nLeggings have often been a garment associated with childrenswear. With their ease of movement and comfortable style, they are appropriate for a growing child who may change in size regularly. Stirrup style leggings are also popular amongst those purchasing childrenswear.\nEmerging from the eighties era, leg wear also become popular during this time when fitness wear was deemed stylish and worn as everyday wear. Popularised by chart topping bands of the time and the likes of Jane Fonda's workout videos, fitness wear was definitely a trend that many associate tight fitting leg wear with today. Whilst during the eighties, neon bright colours were popular for leg wear, but since then styles have developed and we now see that prints and patterns have become more and more popular. Seen on catwalks throughout London, Paris, Milan and New York, prints are consistently in fashion and are unlikely to ever go out. Whilst some prints come in and out of fashion such as animal print, other prints quickly come into replace them such as this season's popular print of dogtooth. What remains in style is the basic design of the garment such as classic leggings.\nDepending on the occasion they are worn for will also coincide with an acceptable age to wear leggings. For example, if an older lady wore leggings to the cheap, she may not be judged as much as if she was to wear them on a night out. Whilst they do make great gym wear, it is not to say that they cannot be worn for nights out. Recently popularised by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, leather look leg wear is at the height of fashion and create the perfect look for a night out, but should these style of leggings have an age restriction?\nIf the wearer feels comfortable in the garment, why should there be an age restriction? Yes it is clear that some styles will be more suited to some ages than others but it remains entirely the wearers choice.\nAnother consideration would have to be gender. There is nothing to say that men can also not wear leggings, if it is acceptable for the gym it should be acceptable for everyday wear.\nConclusively, leg wear has developed dramatically over the years and is clear to see that no age restrictions should be applicable when considering who can or cannot wear leggings.",

    "text": "California Vehicle Code 21058 is intended to protect patients who live in rural areas that may go to hospitals that do not have doctors on staff at all hours of the day and night. There are numerous situations when a doctor may be needed at legitimate emergencies, and getting there fast is essential. If there's a shooting victim, a car accident patient or a woman with labor complications, at a rural hospital it's important to get a doctor to the operating room fast. In rural areas the on-call surgeon may live 15 or 20 miles away from the hospital and it's important for that surgeon to be able to get there in a hurry without worrying about legal repercussions. There are still many rural hospitals in California that still rely on the on-call physician for emergencies.\nThis law was not designed to give doctors a \"get out of jail free\" excuse. There are still stipulations as to when the law applies. First, the doctor must be going to a legitimate emergency. Having dinner reservations, or being late to the airport will not constitute an emergency. Second, the doctor must maintain a reasonably safe speed. There is no excuse for driving recklessly, and doctors who cause harm to another person while speeding to an emergency will still be held accountable for their actions. Lastly, the doctors cannot allow someone else to borrow their car for the purposes of using the CMA sticker. This law only applies to a vehicle that is registered to a licensed doctor; if that vehicle is being used by the doctor; while the doctor is on his or her way to a real emergency.\nThis law does not prevent an officer from pulling over a doctor. The doctor must show that he or she is on their way to an emergency. While most officers will probably not question a licensed physician, an officer that questions the authenticity of the emergency can still issue a citation. The physician would not be held accountable, and would not have to pay the ticket upon showing the court proof of the emergency. However, the doctor will have lost valuable time getting to the emergency while the officer is writing the ticket.\nThere has been some debate between the California Medical Association (CMA) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) over the necessity of this law. The CHP argues that the law, which was passed in 1954, is outdated and no longer necessary. The CMA argues that in rural areas the law is still needed and could save lives. For now, the law is still on the books and the CMA regularly gives stickers to licensed physicians to use in case of emergencies.",

    "text": "The night before Texas Rowing was to compete in the Big 12 Championship, head coach Carie Graves, an Olympic rower herself, took some time to explain to her Longhorns the physical reality of pushing the body to its limit.\nOf course there\u2019s an equation involving calories burned and calories consumed, but in a seven-minute time trial of leg drives and lactic acid, success can largely be defined by one muscle \u2013 the heart.\nOn Saturday in Oklahoma, the Longhorns displayed theirs in a manner that moved their coach to near tears. UT claimed its fourth-straight Big 12 Conference crown by just one point, the closest margin of victory in the history of the meet.\nUT collected 105 points, followed by rival Oklahoma with 104. Victories by UT\u2019s second varsity four, fourth varsity eight and second varsity eight boats highlighted the Longhorns\u2019 day, but the first varsity eight race is the premier event and awards the most points.\nThe Longhorns fell by nearly 10 seconds to the Sooners at the Longhorn Invitational in March, but at the conference race, with a shuffled lineup, UT pulled within a half-second of the Sooners.\nStill disappointed to finish second, Graves saw a purpose from her boat that had been missing for most of the spring.\nAt the finish line, many of the Longhorns were also reduced to tears. Partly because they felt the agony of defeat, and partly because they finally felt the void of self expenditure. They gave themselves to the boat.\n\u201cIt was their very best effort,\" Graves said.\nGraves challenged her rowers to push to that evil place, to the place of maximum effort and pain. To their credit, the Longhorns did.\nThis race against OU started much like the one on the final day of the Longhorn Invitational on March 18. The Sooners were stronger off the line, forcing UT to play catch-up for the entire race.\nThe difference came in UT\u2019s response. Instead of wilting against a seemingly insurmountable deficit, the Longhorns kept rowing, kept pushing and kept fighting. UT clawed back the entire race and was the stronger boat in the final 250 meters. In fact, had the race been three strokes longer, the Longhorns would have likely won.\nThe record however will show that the Longhorns lost, but that Texas won the team title. And that remains the Longhorns\u2019 victory in defeat.\nWell, that and the notion that they can still get faster. Graves isn\u2019t one to let her rowers be satisfied.",

I started North to South to document our experiences traveling near and far to the places we\u2019ve always dreamed of visiting, and to share those experiences freely with the world \u2013 family, friends, and curious strangers alike.\nI hope you\u2019ll find something of value to you here on North to South. Have a question about a destination we\u2019ve been to? Want to know more about my decision to quit my job to travel the world? I\u2019m an open book, and I\u2019d love to hear from you. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. You can also find me on Facebook and Instagram.\nHere are some random fun facts about me.\nI love adventures, so I\u2019ll try almost anything once.\nI eat vegetarian with the exception of must-try local foods.\nI went to college in sunny, laid-back Malibu.\nI can speak and understand Spanish pretty well.\nI have a dog named Tiger, a playful guy with a big ol\u2019 heart and tiger stripes. My parents were kind enough to give him a home when I started traveling so I still get to hang out with him once in awhile.\nI prefer riding my bike over driving my car. We sold both when we started traveling, but after purchasing our Chicago condo, we both got some vintage road bikes again!\nI don\u2019t watch much TV, but I love Netflix.\nMy favorite foods are orange bell peppers and cheesecake.\nI absolutely hate the cold, but we picked Norway as our first destination.\nI\u2019ve got a fantastic travel companion in my boyfriend fianc\u00e9 husband Ian who shares my passion for travel and trying new things.\nI hate loud noises, but I blast music in the car at nearly full volume.\nMy first time out of the U.S. was on a trip to Spain with my high school Spanish class. I was 17.\nI get antsy being in one place for too long.\nBelow are a few of the common questions posed to us about our exciting journey transitioning from traditional American lives to full time travelers.\nWHAT INSPIRED US TO START TRAVELING?\nAfter each of us struggled to find joy in traditional American full-time jobs, we decided to call it quits and get out and explore the world.\nIn early 2014, the risk of wasting our time and missing out on new experiences finally won us over. It outweighed the risks involved in taking a non-traditional leap out of the regular working world and into the world of travel and entrepreneurship. There were a lot of unanswered questions, but we were confident we\u2019d figure it out.\nWe picked a goal date (March 1, 2014), outlined a plan for our transition, and decided that if we stayed on track and pooled up some extra savings, we\u2019d make the decision official at the beginning of February. After the first week of February, we\u2019d already booked flights and a place to stay for our first month overseas.\nOn March 2, 2014 (our two-year anniversary) we set out on our first adventure destination: the Norwegian fjords around Stord, Norway.\nRead more about our transition from average working Americans to full time travelers (with tips on how you can do it) here: Quit Your Job and Travel The World.\nHOW DO WE PLAN TO GET BY?\nWith our creative entrepreneurship skills, of course!\nYes, we\u2019ve got money in savings, but it\u2019s for emergencies only. A sustainable travel lifestyle is key to our success, so we plan to focus our energy on entrepreneurial endeavors that can be managed from anywhere (as long as there\u2019s Internet access somewhere nearby). Check out LonelySpeck.com \u2013 currently our biggest ongoing online project, focused on sharing astrophotography knowledge and skills with others. While you\u2019re at it, take a peek at StylishTravelGirl.com, my new site for fashionable traveling women, and PhotonCollective.com, our latest photography web project.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF YOUR STUFF?\nSurprisingly, I think this is actually the question I was asked most frequently when we were preparing to leave on our first trip. Everyone was so concerned with what would become of our things! Well, we donated most items, sold a few things, and stored even fewer in a closet at my parents\u2019 house. Aside from the stuff we packed for our first trip, we actually kept very little.\nSend me your question, and I\u2019ll respond as quickly as our traveling lifestyle and Internet access allows!",

    "text": "At the beginning of the 20th Century, the United States Army was sorely pressed to meet its overseas commitments in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. As a result, in 1901 Congress authorized 5 additional Regular Army Infantry regiments; the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th Infantry. All 5 regiments subsequently served the Army well. The 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry traces its lineage back to when it was first organized on 25 December 1900 in the Regular Army at the Presidio of San Francisco, California, as Company A, 1st Provisional Battalion of Infantry. It was consolidated on 7 February 1901 with Company A, 26th Infantry (which was first constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army), and consolidated unit designated as Company A, 26th Infantry.\nThe 26th Infantry began its life overseas in the Philippines and spent its first 20 years of service on deployments to the Southwest Pacific, the Mexican and Indian frontier and in Europe. It earned its first battle streamer during the Philippine Insurrection within 2 years of its forming as a unit.\nAfter returning to the same location for another tour of duty (a habit the 26th Infantry Regiment would keep for the entire century), the 26th Infantry Regiment fought off Mexican bandits and settled disputes in the Indian Territory until it was selected as one of only 4 Regular Army Infantry Regiments deemed fit for immediate combat to form the 1st American Expeditionary Division in June of 1917. This expeditionary division would later be redesignated the 1st Division (and subsequently the 1st Infantry Division) and thus began ths 26th Infantry Regiment's long association with the Big Red One.\nAs part of the first American soldiers to arrive in France, the 26th Infantry Regiment immediately left for the front. Along with its sister regiments of the 1st Division, it earned more campaign streamers than any other regiments during the First World War, but at a terrible cost. Over 900 members of the Regiment their lives in a 6-month period. At Soisson alone, the regimental commander, executive officer, 2 of 3 battalion commanders and regimental sergeant major were killed in action. Sixty-two officers were killed or wounded and out of 3100 men that started the attack, over 1500 had been killed or wounded. The battle was won and this turned the tide for the Allies at a crucial period during the summer of 1918. By war's end, the soldiers earned 7 battle streamers and 2 foreign awards. It was also during this conflict that the Regiment's name, the \"Blue Spaders\" came into usage. The name referred to the Regimental shield, which consisted of the Mohawk arrowhead. Colonel Hamilton A. Smith selected this to represent the regimental spirit of courage, resourceful daring and relentless pursuit of an enemy.\nFollowing a brief occupation duty in Germany, the regiment returned to the United States and served as a part of a smaller peacetime Army until 1941. In the 1920s and 30s, the unit's permanent home station became Plattsburg Barracks, New York. These years would involve training exercises and maneuvers along with the normal routines of garrison duty.\nIn 1941, the regiment once again stood with its sister regiments and prepared for war in Europe. In World War II, the 26th Infantry led America's first-ever amphibious assault in North Africa, fought at the Kasserine Pass, assaulted Sicily, invaded Normandy, conquered the first German city of the war at Aachen, vaulted the Rhine and attacked all the way to Czechoslovakia by war's end. The 26th Infantry Regiment conducted 3 amphibious assaults, and earned 7 battle streamers, a Presidential Unit Citation, and 5 foreign awards.\nBeginning another occupation of Germany, the \"Blue Spaders\" were given the honor of bearing the United States National Colors at the Allied Victory in Europe parade, and were selected to serve as America's guard of honor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. Thus began a lengthy stay in Germany, first as conquerors and later as friends and Allies.\nThe unit was reorganized and redesignated on 15 February 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battle Group, 26th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 1st Infantry Division with its organic elements concurrently constituted and activated. It was relieved on 14 April 1959 from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division and assigned to the 8th Infantry Division.\nServing as a battle group in Europe in the early 1960s, the unit was attached to various Divisions. It was relieved on 24 October 1962 from assignment to the 8th Infantry Division and assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division. It was relieved on 15 February 1963 from assignment to the 2nd Infantry Division and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division. It was then reorganized and redesignated on 13 January 1964 as the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry.\nThe Battalion rejoined the 1st Infantry Division shortly before receiving orders to deploy as a part of the Army's first divisional-sized unit in Vietnam in 1965. The \"Blue Spaders\" served longer in Vietnam with their \"Big Red One\" units than any other division. After 5 continuous years of combat the \"Blue Spaders\" received orders to return home in 1970 with 11 battle streamers, a Valorous Unit Award and 2 foreign awards for its colors.\nAt the conclusion of Vietnam, the Battalion returned to Germany as part of a forward-deployed brigade of the 1st Infantry Division. The unit was inactivated on 24 February 1983 in Germany and relieved from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division, when that Brigade returned to the United States.\nThe 26th Infantry was transfered to TRADOC on 3 April 1987, where the 26th Infantry's Regiments spent several years training recruits. The 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry was inactivated on 15 January 1996 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and withdrawn from the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command.\nOn 16 February 1996, the Battalion rejoined the \"Big Red One\" in Germany only to send its soldiers to Bosnia as part of the first American forces to enter the Balkans from February to September 1996. The entire Battalion followed its initial deployment from October 1996 to April 1997. In March 1998, the \"Blue Spaders\" deployed again to the Balkans, this time to the Republic of Macedonia. Returning briefly in September 1998, the Battalion was the first unit alerted for deployment to Kosovo in June 1999. It returned in December 1999. During this period, the unit earned the Superior Unit Award streamer and the Defense of Kosovo streamer for the colors. Three of Task Force 1-26 Infantry's soldiers lost their lives in Kosovo.\nIn 2004 the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry deployed with other elements of the 1st Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Following that deployment the unit was redesignated on 1 October 2005 as the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment.\nAfter serving another tour of duty in Iraq in 2007, the unit was relieved on 16 March 2008 from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division and assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. This was part of the transformation of the 2nd Brigade to the US Army's modular force structure. 3rd Brigade Combat Team had perviously converted in 2006 and the 2nd Battalion, 26th Infantry was concurrently inactivated and reflagged as the 1st battalion, 26th Infantry.\nIn June 2008 the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, including the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry, deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit remained deployed in that country into 2009.",

    "text": "Red Hood and the Outlaws is an underdog book about a group of underdogs, and I'm not really surprised DC Comics keeps giving it second changes, through \"DC You\" and into \"Rebirth.\" The concept is sound (filling a space in the DC Universe previously held by books like Outsiders and Secret Six), and Scott Lobdell, I thought, wrote Red Hood, Arsenal, and Starfire well in this book's beginnings. Though indeed there were questionable choices in how the book handled Starfire especially, I think some of this book's worse reputation came from confusing the unseriousness of the characters (especially Arsenal, which was largely an act) with the book itself. In depicting a group of troubled superheroes with no one but one another, Lobdell succeeded.\nRed Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 4: League of Assassins is the first volume absent both Lobdell and original artist Kenneth Rocafort, now with James Tynion and Julius Gopez. Tynion has going for the book a strong understanding of the relationship between the Outlaws, and a storyline that authentically puts that to the test. At the same time, this long storyline gets overcomplicated, with lots of mystic gobbledegook, and Tynion gets wrong some of what Lobdell established earlier.\nBut also tellingly, Tynion's best issue here is the one not drawn by Gopez. Though there's nothing egregiously wrong, the book's art is routinely inked too darkly and the characters' appearances are inconsistent from one issue to the next. This looks like a generic superhero book, far especially from Rocafort, and it might be another reason Red Hood and the Outlaws doesn't get its respect.\nFrom the outset, Tynion's League of Assassins is a story about Arsenal Roy Harper trying to keep the Outlaws together after a traumatized, amnesic Red Hood Jason Todd departs, and Tynion's got that heart of the story right. Roy acts desperately, almost pathetically, but he's meant to be a pathetic figure, recognizing rightly that Jason and Starfire Koriand'r's friendship is the best thing in his life. Outlaws is a story of co-dependence; the characters are great for one another because they're so bad for one another. Tynion smartly develops a plot that puts Jason, Roy, and Kori on three different sides of a war, momentarily pitted against one another, and that's an excellent dynamic four volumes into their time together.\nTynion also does well in establishing two other important relationships for Roy Harper. In the uncertain rollout of the New 52, what time Roy spent with Green Arrow wasn't quite clear. It's been expanded on a bit in flashback late in the Green Arrow series, but here Tynion has them on the page together perhaps for the first time and writes their dysfunctional dynamic well (I also like Tynion's invention of the \"Roybots\" security). Second, Tynion pits Roy against Cheshire, the mother of his child in other continuities; I thought Tynion portrayed Cheshire as too flip in the beginning, but she evens out and we see hints of what she and Roy might actually see in one another before the book is through.\nI give Tynion credit for a long story (eight issues and an annual) and indeed it actually continues on into the next book. The book doesn't even feel decompressed -- I don't mind a long story one can sink their teeth into -- as that Tynion's motivations for the characters comes off strained. There's a bounty out to kill the Outlaws, which we learn was set by the mystic group the Untitled, ultimately for no good reason than to \"keep [the characters] on [their] feet,\" which is nonsense if the Untitled needed the Outlaws alive. Meanwhile the League of Assassins mean to recruit Jason to lead them even despite his amnesia and for reasons never wholly clear. And various characters -- the rival organization All-Caste's Ducra and Essence, and Ra's al Ghul -- have different plans, revealed and not, that contribute to the book's central jumble.\nFurther, Lobdell had established that a seeming war between the Untitled and the All-Caste had actually been started by the character Essence within the All-Caste; Tynion reverses this and makes the war really the Untitled's fault. Again, it's a lot of mystic back-and-forth, but the result is that Tynion takes something that had nuance and wasn't what it seemed, and instead makes it very plain without shades of gray. To be sure, this was one mystic group too many even under Lobdell, unlikely to be seen or heard from again in the DC Universe, but I'd have preferred that Tynion built on what Lobdell established (which admittedly he does to a great extent) than to change it.\nTynion cleverly accommodates the book's tie-in with the Batman: Zero Year storyline, leading into a flashback just before that issue. The tie-in issue, with art by Constantine's Jeremy Haun, is among the strongest in the book and also better than most Zero Year tie-ins in that Tynion actually delves into Zero Year's Red Hood mystery, maybe suggesting a thing or two. Notably, we can now say that Jason Todd was a \"Red Hood\" before he ever encountered the Joker; though not explicit, we kind of understand why Jason chose that moniker now. We also see some of Jason and Talia al Ghul's relationship and why Talia might have brought Jason back from the dead. This whole book needs more Talia, frankly; I guess Talia is dead when this book is set, but her death isn't remarked on clearly enough for the audience to understand what's at stake for the League of Assassins and Ra's al Ghul as regards what plans Talia has in motion.\nRed Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 4: League of Assassins offers a glimpse of this title not written by Scott Lobdell, and the fact that it's more or less viable suggests good things for the characters going forward. The fact that Lobdell gets the title back in a few volumes, and keeps it through \"DC You\" and into the new \"Rebirth\" iteration, is just icing on the cake. This is not Red Hood and the Outlaws at its best, but even so it demonstrates the complex characters that have kept the title going as long as it has.\nI always found this series to be incredibly overrated. It never felt like the writer ever had any sort of direction for these characters, he just threw stuff at the wall, and then pivoted depending on audience reaction. And the constant exposition gets really grating. Yes, we can see that Red Hood's pointing a gun at Superman. We don't need every character to say that Red Hood's pointing a gun at Superman.\nI thought of Red Hood and the Outlaws as something of a pallet cleanser after reading a few heavier dramatic titles. It always had at least semi decent story lines and it had flawed characters that helped each other grow because they needed someone else to lean on.\nWhile not being top level writing, all writers of the series (there are 3, I almost forgot Will Pfeifer who wrote a few issues that are printed in volume 5) make sure that it's the characters you care about even if the story gets a small dip in quality.\nAnd while I'm not going to spoil anything of future volumes, I want to address your comment about it looking good for DC You. They completely changed the tone in the Red Hood/Arsenal title, more in the art than in the writing, it really feels like some bad editorial decisions being forced on it. It does get better and when the story reaches Robin War this seems to be completely gone. The Starfire title was something I couldn't read, the first issue was something my girlfriend enjoys (who is in her early 20s) and seems to have the humor of some of the \"high school\" shows she watches on youth channels.",

So congratulations to Lynn and his staff for pulling that off.\nBevis concluded by saying \u201cthank you to Lynn for the numerous other projects he spearheaded to help put our city on the map where it is today\u201d before he directed the group to the front of the facility for the unveiling of the sign.\nFollowing the reveal, Rives spoke about receiving the (slightly delayed) honor.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. It\u2019s a very nice thing to do and I really appreciate it,\u201d he told Oldsmar Connect.\nOldsmar officials dodge flying metal clips during the unveiling of the sign dedicating the Lynn Rives Environmental Education Center on Monday, Mar. 12, 2018.\nDespite his initial reluctance to have something named after him, Rives admitted it was special to see his name on this facility.\nBraithwaite and Rives\u2019 successor, Felicia Donnelly, also commented after the ceremony.\n\u201cHe is an amazing go-getter,\u201d Braithwaite, who started his career with the city at the same time as Rives, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone who gets things done as well as he does.",

    "text": "As the sky turns from blue to orange in the Zimbabwe bush, a cool breeze blows to chase away the scorching heat of the afternoon, ushering in the night. A small brown mammal with plate-like scales rustles through the grass. Little does it know that it walks close to the path of extinction.\nThere hasn\u2019t been a more dangerous time to be a pangolin. The species has become the most trafficked mammal in the world. They are illegally traded for their scales, as bush meat or for medicinal purposes. But the threat of their extinction rarely makes news. An organisation in Zimbabwe aims to change this by educating the public about an animal many may not know even exists. Enabled by the Tikki Hywood Trust, a group of men dedicate their lives to rehabilitating captured pangolins. They are entrusted with caring for animals that have endured major stress, often having been transported many kilometres bound in a sack, starved and dehydrated.\nThe process takes a lot of patience. It is a difficult task to gain the trust of the pangolins while trying to nurture them to full health. But the men do this with love for the animal. They have developed an intimate relationship while caring for them. Pangolins are like their children. And like any parent, they will protect their family from anything that poses a threat.",

    "text": "It's practically summertime so there are lots and lots of movies opening soon. One of these is The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 which opens on June 12. It's about guys who hijack New York subway train Pelham 123, hold people hostage, demand money, and escape - but how?. One regular transit dispatcher guy ends up involved. The movie stars famous people (Denzel Washington and John Travolta) and the trailers make it look really exciting and action-y. I'd sort of thought of trying to see it when it comes out, if it got good reviews.\nAnd this is a good heist movie - actually, it's a good movie, period. It's suspenseful and engrossing, with some comic moments thrown to ease the tension. It was interesting to see how the hijackers used their knowledge of the New York subway system and its trains to pull off the job. If you're going to do any kind of heist, it's important to know just how everything works, yes?\nThe main question throughout is how the hijackers are going to escape and get away with the job. I'm not going to tell you whether they succeed or how it ends - even though the movie has been remade, I don't know whether they'll use the exact same story. They've already changed the title (words representing numbers are so old-fashioned; why not just the numbers instead?) and I hope that they don't change the actual story too much. Being the age that it is, I expect that they'll not only modernize the story to reflect the updated technology, but also add some new twists and turns and stunts. Maybe even an explosion or two.\nAs long the remake stays a heist movie, it'll probably be ok.\nI agree it will be interesting to see the remake. I enjoyed Robert Shaw. He does such a great villain. Did you notice the young Doris Roberts as thle mayor's wife. A real classic.",

    "text": "When the summer break began, Jinno Naoto and Manabe Rika confessed their thought they had since their childhood and began to go out with each other. Suddenly a boy named Asmodeus appeared. He said he was a devil, and he tried to take Rika away. Naoto did his best to save Rika from Asmodeus, but he couldn't anything to do with devil's power. At that very moment, a girl Luvriel, who name herself an angel, came and saved them.\nThey took Luvriel injured in the battle against the devil. There, Luvriel told them the surprising things; angles in Heaven and devils in Hell have been fighting for a long time, and the devil would attack them again.\nBecause Luvriel had lost her power during the fight, she asked Rika fight for her.\nOn the other hand, the devil had lost his power in the fight. Then, Otonashi Meimi, who was a classmate of Naoto, happened to come and see Naoto confess his love to Rika, and she became jealous. Taking advantage of her jealous, he haunted her. He made Meimi into an evil heroine, Misty, and made her attack Rika again. On the other hand, Luvriel turned Rika into Sei Tenshi Djibril and let her fight against them.",

This past Thursday, I met author and motivational speaker, Marianne Williamson.?\nSeventeen years ago, ?I purchased her book, A Return to Love, and since that time have read it at least five times. To this day, this book remains one of my personal favorites in my home library. Both the author, and her book have changed my life in a powerful way and have allowed me to share these experiences to help others find love in their lives.\nOf course I was meant to meet Marianne Williamson. Why it took 17 years, I am not sure as we have mutual friends and business acquaintances in common. ?Perhaps I wasn\u2019t ready yet, but when I received an invitation from my friend, Gina Ratliffe to meet Marianne, I jumped at the chance.?\nHer teachings have had a profound affect on my life. After her powerful talk, I had the opportunity talk with her personally and thanked her. ?We embraced each other with a loving hug, and she listened as I told her just how much she has meant to me over the years. It was our moment together of authenticity and pure love.\nThe process from her book, teachings, and her interpretation of The Course in Miracles is simple. You get scared, you go into fear mode. To get out of fear mode, you return to love mode. The opposite of love isn\u2019t hate?it\u2019s fear. It\u2019s simple, practical, ?spiritual, and we all need to be reminded of it on a regular basis. This goes for love relationships, work relationships, and friendships.\nand practice these simple and powerful techniques.

    "text": "This guest post came about from a mutual love of tennis and the result of a wager for the Ronald Garros final match, in which Rafael Nadal won over Novak Djokovic.\nDavid Wiseman works at Kahena Digital, a Jerusalem online marketing and SEO Company and can be found on twitter at @daw1975.\nLet\u2019s bring the worlds of tennis and SEO together again: Here are the 13 things the game of tennis has in common with SEO.\nJust as in SEO, ranking are everything in tennis. As a tennis player, not a day goes by where you aren\u2019t aware of your ranking. It defines you.\nWith any rankings there can be quirks, such as Danish player Caroline Wozniacki. There was much consternation that she got to Number One without having won a grand slam title.\nSimilarly, occasionally there is much angst and dismay as to the inequality and illogic of Google\u2019s rankings. Ranking highly shouldn\u2019t be the sole focus but a happy by-product. People should look at the rankings as part of the journey and not just the destination. If you don\u2019t, things are finished once you get to #1 as opposed to only just beginning.\nA tennis match can be broken down into hundreds of different statistical categories \u2013 first serve %, unforced errors, break point converted, winners, etc.\nSEO has so many numbers rankings, visits, conversions, time on site, bounce rate, et al that it comes down to which ones you look at and show the client and which ones you don\u2019t show the client.\nIn SEO, it\u2019s not as black and white. Some SEO folk say that conversions have nothing to do with them. That once the traffic comes to the site, their job is done. I am not of that opinion but if a person is, it\u2019s hard to argue with them. That\u2019s like arguing Bjorn Borg is the best clay court tennis player of all time. You will go back and forth on this for hours and not get anywhere.\nIn tennis, if there are any weaknesses in your game, quickly they are going to be found out. Whether it\u2019s your second serve, backhand or volleying, opponents are going to identify these weaknesses and then start hammering away at them \u2013 forcing you into positions where your weaknesses are exposed.\nThe more all-round player you are, the harder it will be to defeat you. It\u2019s human nature to stick to what we\u2019re good at and what we like to do and eschew the rest, but the more kinks we eliminate from our game the more versatile and stronger we become.\nSome people can\u2019t stand analytics and do everything they can to avoid it, some hate outreach, interacting with clients, presenting & public speaking, programming, working to deadlines, pivot tables, punctuality, etc. The more strings we add to our racquet, the more valuable we become.\nThis is relevant to tennis as you want to prevent your opponent from scoring any points.\nIt\u2019s a different kind of love in SEO. The Beatles weren\u2019t lying when they sang, \u201cThe love you take is equal to the love you make.\u201d SEO is a world filled with different opinions and ways of doing things but there is nothing to gain by taking the high moral ground or a holier than thou attitude.\nTennis player spend hundreds of hours practicing.\nHow much time do you spend on your SEO game? Do you put in the hours reading and commenting on blogs, following tweets and staying abreast of other industry news? You have to make it part of your schedule otherwise you are going to lose your edge.\nIn tennis, the racquet you use is of critical importance. It is the tool of your trade and it needs to feel comfortable in your hand. While you may stay wedded to your current make and model, it behooves you to know what else is out there, try it out and possibly even switch.\nIn SEO, the technology changes so quickly that it is almost impossible to keep track of. There are tools coming out all the time for every aspect of the industry. It\u2019s important to find balance between always changing the way you work to be blindly loyal to it. Find that middle ground.\nIt is common for players to climb in to the stands following a win and share the moment with their entourage. Similarly while one or two people may be the figureheads of a campaign or pitch, there is a whole team responsible for its success.\nIn tennis you are talking about a coach, manager, dietician, nutritionist, yoga instructor, pilates teacher, masseuse and physiotherapist.\nIn the SEO word you have all the staff who work on a campaign. It\u2019s important that their hard work is both recognized and appreciated.\nOver the years you have worked out a game plan that you feel is best to your game. You are going to tweak it according to your opponent, but if things aren\u2019t working, don\u2019t be afraid to shake things up and try something else. Suffice to say that if you are two sets to love down, you have to try something different.\nSo too with a campaign if the numbers aren\u2019t moving in the right direction, you may have to change tack. You could be stubborn and hope that things turn around on their own and this could well be the case, but sometimes you have to re-assess things and mid-campaign be prepared to implement a new game-plan.\nIn tennis, there are two types of players \u2013 those who try to hit winners and those who are simply trying to keep the ball in play. Going for winners is a high risk/reward play and being risk averse may protect you from things going horribly pear-shaped but you aren\u2019t going to get anywhere.\nIn your SEO campaign if you believe in yourself and what you are doing you should have the confidence to go for it. Sometimes only 4 out of every 10 ideas work, but for four to be spectacular successes, six aren\u2019t. That\u2019s life. You can\u2019t let the fear of failure paralyze you otherwise it\u2019s going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nIf we were playing in the final of the French Open we would be pumped up, motivated and focused. Playing in a tiny tournament on a back court in Uzbekistan we may find that we are not as switched on.\nWorking on a campaign for a Fortune 500 client is stimulating and invigorating and that requires no motivational talks to ram home the import of it, the ramifications of doing well and more so, those of not doing so. On a smaller client, energy levels just aren\u2019t going to be the same. That\u2019s human nature but if you treat it lightly or neglect it, it could well disappear.\nSometimes it just isn\u2019t your day. You\u2019re going to lose and it\u2019s important that you are a good loser as much as you are a good winner.\nThe good winner isn\u2019t much of an issue in SEO where gloating is just another word for celebrating; but being a good loser is definitely important in SEO. Don\u2019t be the person who plays the blame game and starts ranting and raving while pointing the finger. You can blame Google, the client, your colleagues, a lack of caffeine and faulty data, but ultimately you have to put your hand up and say that it\u2019s on you.\nA sense of humor is a must in SEO otherwise you aren\u2019t going to last too long. Novak Djokovic turned things around when he was able to make fun of himself. He loosened up which is something that an uber uptight Ivan Lendl never managed.\nThis clip of Djokovic is from the 2007 US Open.\nHe lost the final there but the next Grand Slam he played in, he won and this was his first Grand Slam title. He has never looked back.",

    "text": "Whether you choose concrete or asphalt for your new driveway, either choice must be constructed over a well compacted base of gravel. Each project has a unique requirement in this area, so please ensure that your concrete or asphalt (or blacktop) paving contractor has done a proper site inspection and understands the differences each material will require when it comes to paving the area you\u2019ve requested.\nWith Bortolo and Sons motto being \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s underneath that counts!\u201d, we take pride in ensuring that the base of your paving project is as solid as can be to ensure that your new driveway will last as long as possible.\nWhile asphalt and concrete are similar, there are some unique differences between them. See the chart to the right to get a better idea of which surface is best suited to your project. The tabs below the before and after pictures go into more detail about the differences mentioned in the comparison chart.\nTo see what an asphalt or concrete driveway will cost you, please either give us a call at: 604-298-8775 or use our quote request form.\nJust as each home is unique, so are your choices when it comes to driveways. An asphalt driveway can offer the same appearance as the roadway you drove into it from. Where a concrete driveway can literally offer a black and white difference between the roadway and your property. Each product offers a different appearance and finishing characteristics.\nConcrete provides many more options when it comes to different finishes. Staining or tinting in a vast array of colors is possible, as well as being able to create patterns using different colours within the same driveway. In addition to colouring, concrete can be stamped, etched or engraved into different patterns to create a unique look. But it doesn\u2019t end there. You can customize the texture with brushing, aggregates or even polishing to a smooth finish. By using a combination of these finishes, you have a virtually unlimited number of options to create a paved surface as unique as you and your home.\nAsphalt (aka blacktop) is much more limited in finishing options. Asphalt must be rolled and compressed, so there isn\u2019t much available in the way of unique finishes. If you\u2019re looking for a custom pattern or texture, it can\u2019t provide the same finishes as concrete can, but lately there have been some options available when it comes to colouring and patterns that can be applied, even to an already existing surface.\nTo get a better idea of different finishing options please see our Custom Colours, Patterns & Textures page for more information.\nCold Canadian winters and warm hot summers each provide a unique challenge to a paved surface. Climate is always an important consideration.\nConcrete has a tendency to crack and can suffer from frost heaving in cold, freezing conditions. Also, salt can create a pitted surface in the concrete which can leave marks or a blotchy appearance in your driveway.\nAsphalt, on the other hand, has issues in hotter climates. The high heat of a hot summer day can cause the tar in blacktop to soften and even deform under extreme heat. It\u2019s naturally darker colour doesn\u2019t do itself any favours when it comes to heat absorption either. Items that are heavy and don\u2019t have enough surface area to spread the weight (such as a motorcycle kickstand) can dig into and damage the surface under these conditions.\nYour professional paving contractor should understand the local climate be able to make the right recommendations to ensure the right material for your application.\nAsphalt driveways should be sealed after they have had 6 months to a year to fully cure. After the initial sealing, it should be reapplied every 2-3 years. Many products are available for this at your local hardware store, and no special machinery is required, so this task can be accomplished by almost any home owner. With a good base, proper sealing and regular maintenance a blacktop driveway can last up to 30 years.\nWhile concrete driveways do not necessarily need to be sealed to ensure a long lifespan, sealing a concrete driveway can prevent stains and discolouration. Concrete driveways stain easier than blacktop and require a degreaser to remove oil based stains. We highly recommend sealing a concrete driveway every few years, especially if you have a custom colour, finish or texture in order to preserve it\u2019s best appearance.\nLearn more about Driveway Maintenance \u2013 Asphalt and Concrete.\nAsphalt is generally much cheaper to install than concrete. On average, the cost per square foot for blacktop will be considerably cheaper than concrete. However price fluctuation due to the cost of crude oil can affect an asphalt driveway\u2019s price. Maintenance costs for blacktop can be higher than a concrete driveway due to it requiring a sealant be applied more often.\nConcrete has many factors that can increase it\u2019s cost. The different custom colours, patterns & textures can all increase the cost of a concrete driveway over a plain concrete surface. Even a basic concrete driveway will be more expensive due to the required forms, rebar and construction & curing time. However the plethora of different finishing options make it an attractive choice and can add enough value and curb appeal to your home to offset the initial higher cost.\nCracks in both asphalt and concrete driveways can be repaired.\nAsphalt cracks are much easier to repair and blend into the original surface. The very nature of asphalt\u2019s tar base and flexibility offer an easy to repair surface that concrete simply cannot match.\nConcrete repairs meanwhile, are more obvious due to discolouration, fading and weathering. While they can be repaired to ensure a long useful life span, asphalt repairs appear more like the original paved surface than concrete does after being repaired.",

    "text": "Time for college? Get prepared with these great ideas.\nThe beginning of every school year brings a mixed bag of emotions, and that doesn\u2019t change when your kid is heading off to college. In the hustle and bustle, it\u2019s easy to overlook the emotional aspect of this big change. Smooth the transition by preparing along with packing up laptops, books, and towels.\nStart by reading up a little on the subject. Psychologist and author Tamar Chansky wrote a helpful list of ideas for coping on HuffPost Parents. While the advice is directed to students, it\u2019s useful for parents too. For example, be prepared for the waves of emotions to come by keeping fun activities in mind for when one of those waves hit. Get out, get involved, and soon you\u2019ll get happy. For more helpful advice, check the college\u2019s web site and the real-life experience of two moms on Flown and Grown Flown and Grown.\nPlenty of things have changed on campus since you were a student, from Wi-Fi to the dinner menu. One big change is on drop-off day, and (wait for it)\u2026 parent orientation! It\u2019s a real thing and a growing trend according to NODA, the National Orientation Directors Association. The goal of parent orientation is to help put parents at ease with having their children away at school, and to provide parents with resources to help a student adjust to college life, according to Joyce Holl, NODA Executive Director.\nOn the practical side of prepping for college is all the stuff. We found plenty of checklists, and your child\u2019s college likely provides one, but the voice of experience is perhaps the best teacher. One freshman compiled a list of the 21 most forgotten items that is sure to provide at least one \u2018aha moment\u2019 for any student, though we\u2019re not sure a wristlet needs to be at No. 6 on the list!\nTo help reduce the chaos and clutter, we recommend using MyShower products in a shared bath. MySmile and MyShave keep toothbrushes and razors handy and off countertops and tub rims. Use MyShower accessories in the tub for shampoos, conditioners, and soap. All MyShower stylish products are rustproof and mildew resistant \u2014 a big plus for every college dorm suite or apartment bath!\nHave you caught Tiny House fever? How MyShower can make any small bathroom more space savvy.\nIf the number of television shows and websites that focus on the tiny house movement are any indication, this is one trend that appears to be going mainstream. From the extremes of a teeny cabin on wheels to the more moderate downsize to a smaller footprint, there are plenty of reasons that folks are choosing to pursue a tiny house lifestyle\u2014lower cost (imagine being mortgage free!), reduced environmental impact, and increased simplicity.\nThere are many sources for tiny house inspiration, such as the handful of programs on HGTV (check out Tiny House Hunters) and the real life stories featured on the Tiny House Newsletter\u2014they recently featured the story of a millionaire CEO who gave up his luxury apartment for an Airstream trailer.\nNot everyone may be ready to jump on the tiny house bandwagon (make that a tiny wagon), but there are some great space-saving ideas to borrow from compact living. Tiny House for Us has a number of great tips, including repurposing materials typically found on a boat, in the home. Another way to save space in any location is by going vertical\u2014using wall space wherever you can find it.\nAs you might guess, we\u2019re pretty big fans of utilizing vertical space. Using MyShower products throughout your home is a quick, easy and inexpensive way to save space and stay organized. MyShower users have shared many ideas on how they\u2019re saving space with the MyShower products\u2014from the laundry room, to the kitchen and, of course, the bathroom.\nBe sure to follow our social channels for space-saving ideas regardless of whether your home is 150sf or 1500sf! You can find us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\nWe love bloggers! Not only do they come up with interesting ways to use MyShower both in and outside the shower, they\u2019ve also shown just how easy it is to start using MyShower products in a matter of minutes.",

    "text": "When people try to lose weight, there are lots of challenges and there aren\u2019t many approaches. I remember once I interviewed a physician who said that he had about 2,000 books in his library, and each one had the best cure, the best way to lose weight. Obviously, there\u2019s not 1 answer and there are not 2,000 answers, but there are certain things we should have that are consistent as we approach this. I\u2019m Dr. Brian McDonough, and welcome to Primary Care Today on ReachMD. I have a very special guest today, Dr. Lou Aronne. He is the Director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian, and he\u2019s been kind enough to join us. First of all, welcome to the program.\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit about obesity and weight loss. We know it\u2019s a major health problem. The physicians in our audience are dealing with patients every day. What\u2019s your approach, and what do you think we need to know?\nWell, one of the key things I think that physicians need to understand is that obesity is a disease. So, now you\u2019re going to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the disease?\u201d And what research is showing is that hypothalamic neurons, the nerves that carry signals from the stomach, the fat cell, the intestine to the rest of the brain telling the brain how much fat is stored, how much has been eaten, the evidence is they\u2019re damaged in the process of weight gain, so what we believe happens is that bad habits and the environment of too many calories, too much food, not enough exercise, causes a physical change in signaling pathways, and that\u2019s what makes it so hard for people to lose weight. They have these physical changes whereby the neurons become less sensitive to hormonal signals. And so, when you look at how you can approach this, in the past we\u2019ve used reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure, but that hasn\u2019t been completely successful. If it were, I would not have this job. I love telling people that. If all those diet books worked, we would not have the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell. And so something more is going on, and that something is a shift in the set point. How do we manage it? Well, in addition to reducing calorie intake and in addition to increasing physical activity, we have more sophisticated strategies. Surgery has proven its health benefit, but we have on one side diet and physical activity and then do nothing until we do bariatric surgery, and I believe that we are coming to an era where using rationally designed medical therapies and some old therapies that are now being used in a more medically rational way are going to become increasingly common.\nWhen you look at it and you look at your approach to dealing with this, what advice do you have for doctors? We\u2019re dealing with patients all the time. In many cases we ourselves are fighting issues with weight. What do you suggest?\nWell, one of the things we find commonly is that medicine that we as physicians prescribe can cause weight gain. And I can\u2019t tell you how many cases we see. We\u2019ve estimated that about 15% of serious problems with obesity are related to drugs that we prescribe. So, for example, today we were meeting with colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering, across the street from us, and they have and it\u2019s been recognized that in the treatment of breast cancer, weight gain is very common because of the use of aromatase inhibitors as well as some of the antinausea medicines, steroids, strong antihistamines like diphenhydramine. So, what happens in the treatment of breast cancer is women gain weight, but the evidence is that a 5 to 10% weight gain increases the risk of recurrence, and so we\u2019re seeing many physicians in very specific areas looking for strategies to manage weight. And so the first thing we always look for when we manage someone are medicines that could be causing weight gain and which we could change to something else that would encourage weight loss, and that\u2019s a topic, perhaps, for another day. The second thing we do is look for problems like sleep apnea, which make it hard for patients to comply. Sleep apnea is a common comorbid condition. Patients have difficulty focusing when they develop it, and often they look depressed and wind up getting treated with antidepressants that can cause further weight gain. And then, of course, we look for the typical behavioral issues as far as eating, stress, lifestyle, and how we can change those. So, we take a very problem-solving approach where we look for the issues, some of which are very concrete and some not, and try to help the patient to solve those problems. Now, if that works that\u2019s great, we\u2019re thrilled, but if it doesn\u2019t we don\u2019t give up. We go to the next step, and we believe that the use of pharmacotherapy would be the next step in this process.\nYou know, it\u2019s funny how it\u2019s evolved. I remember how people used to say, \u201cWell, just some people are overweight, and you gotta cut down the calories.\u201d We\u2019ve really learned, well, sure, diet plays a very important, maybe the most important part, but there are so many other things we can do, and I think a lot of us as physicians are kind of late to the party because we keep saying, \u201cWatch your diet, cut the calories,\u201d but that may not always be the answer, and I think you\u2019re alluding to that.\nI am, but when it comes to those kinds of recommendations, \u201cpush away from the table\u201d and things like that, there are very concrete recommendations that we make for patients. So, one of the things that has been recognized over the past few years is that no diet works for everybody, so we have a number of different approaches that we utilize. For most of our patients, but certainly not all, a lower carbohydrate or a low glycemic diet seems to be quite effective. It allows people to reduce their calorie intake by changing the macronutrient composition of their diet. Other people, on the other hand, like to count calories, so they can eat virtually anything, but they count the exact number of calories. Two new techniques are intermittent fasting. One technique is where someone cuts their calorie intake to 800 calories or even less 2 days per week. That\u2019s been shown to be as effective as dieting every single day. And then time-restricted fasting where you eat for a period of 8 hours a day or 12 hours a day and then don\u2019t eat for the other 16 to 12 hours, that, too, has been shown to be effective. So, we don\u2019t just give vague advice. We give very specific advice which we\u2026 We kind of negotiate with the patient to see what they can do in their lifestyle. You know, \u201cCan you do it?\u201d That\u2019s the kind of discussion we have with patients where we ask them what can they do. If they\u2019re on board, then we\u2019ll try something.\nI\u2019m Dr. Brian McDonough. You\u2019re listening to Primary Care Today on ReachMD. My guest is Dr. Louis Aronne. We\u2019re talking about weight loss, and I really like the fact that you\u2019re bringing the patient into the conversation, because you\u2019re right, I think a lot of us more or less say, \u201cOkay, this is what you need to do. Read this. Follow this diet,\u201d whatever. You\u2019re making them a partner. And, I mean, I\u2019ve been practicing so many years, I\u2019m realizing the more I make patients a partner the better shot I have.\nI agree completely, especially when it comes to these behavioral changes. It\u2019s easy for me to tell someone, \u201cDon\u2019t eat any carbs and you\u2019re gonna lose weight.\u201d That will happen every time. But, can someone actually do that on a regular basis? Now, you\u2019ll find 1 person who can do it and they wind up in an article in the newspaper that they lost 100 pounds doing this, but I promise you that 99 other people do the exact same thing and it doesn\u2019t work, so it really has to be customized to the patient and their needs and what they can do within their life.\nI teach young residents. As I say, I don\u2019t know if this is good or bad, but as I move through life, I tend to, when I talk to patients, say, \u201cWell, I tried this and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d or, \u201cI tried that and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d What about that approach? Do you find yourself sometimes saying, \u201cLook, this is what most people do,\u201d and do you ever use yourself as the so-called foil to try to help them along?\nSometimes we do that. Generally, we\u2019ll give them examples of patients who\u2019ve succeeded and we tried this and this worked in this patient or that patient, so teaching by example can work, but when it comes to something like weight, it\u2019s so individualized. I mean, when you look at a lot of the diet books that are written by celebrities, it\u2019s basically, \u201cI lost weight, and everyone in the world should lose weight doing the exact same thing.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work that way, so we don\u2019t tell people, \u201cI lost weight doing this. You should do it.\u201d But we will give them examples as we move forward. In certain situations, if someone has prediabetes or they have early type 2, it\u2019s pretty clear what we need to do in a situation like that. We try to reduce their carb intake, we give them metformin, those kinds of things, but in more sophisticated situations, we will use examples.\nIt\u2019s so funny, because having worked in television, I remember one time I went on this diet to show you can lose weight, but they also paid for the trainer, they paid for the workouts, they paid for things that most people are not going to have access to, and they\u2019re certainly not going to get the top people helping them, and that was one of the points of the story, which I remember it frustrated people. I said, \u201cWell, I was given this, this and this, but what do we do without it?\u201d and that really became the most important part of the story. What does the average person do? And I think a lot of things you\u2019re talking about fall into that category of what is realistic and what can you individually do. You mentioned metformin and you mentioned prediabetes, and a lot of what at least I\u2019m reading and learning about is initiating medical treatment a little earlier than we did in the past. What about that?\n\u2014but much lower doses than have been previously prescribed are effective, and we use the equivalent of a quarter of a phentermine tablet to start in most of our patients. We published a phase 2 trial a number of years ago showing that a quarter of a phentermine, half of a phentermine, you\u2019re starting to hit the plateau of weight loss. So, when it comes to the side effect profile that we associate with weight loss medicines, one of the reasons that we\u2019ve been seeing it is lack of understanding of the mechanisms of weight regulations, so we have been overdosing people by trying to get more weight loss by using too much medicine, by just pushing the dose. What our research has shown and the research of other people has shown is that combining medicines is what can really today, with the medicines we have right now, break through the plateau phenomenon. So, we have a medicine that\u2019s a combination of 2, phentermine and topiramate, topiramate which is used most widely for migraine headaches and seizures. When you add those, we\u2019ve shown that you can get additive weight loss between those 2 agents, and phentermine topiramate is approved for obesity treatment. And there are others. The combination of bupropion, which is used as an antidepressant, used for smoking cessation, along with naltrexone, which is used for alcoholism and narcotic treatment, those 2 together can produce greater weight loss. And finally, as an individual agent, there\u2019s liraglutide. It was originally approved for type 2 diabetes. In a higher dose it\u2019s turned out to be effective, probably the most effective single agent for weight loss. There\u2019s a new agent that\u2019s a more lipid-soluble version that\u2019s coming on the market for diabetes, produces even greater weight loss. And finally, there\u2019s lorcaserin. Lorcaserin is a serotonin agonist that produces significant weight loss, very few side effects, very well tolerated, just had an outcome study which came out today\u2014the results of which we first heard about today\u2014showing no increase in risk, and we hope that with further analysis we\u2019ll see a decrease in risk in people who lose weight. If you look at some of the agents that we\u2019re studying now, we\u2019re seeing significantly greater weight loss than even these. We\u2019re seeing 10, 15, even the potential for 20% weight loss in agents that are currently in development.\nDr. Louis Aronne, I want to thank you for joining us. I have to tell you, I had the opportunity with a colleague of mine to give a lecture at the American Academy of Family Physicians conference on obesity, spent months on it. We got a 1-hour lecture. You, in 15 minutes, summarized so effectively what I probably spent 40 hours on. I really appreciate what you did, and I think a lot of people listening appreciate what you did, because you have a good knowledge of it, and you can express it really rapidly and effectively. So, thanks so much for joining us on the program.\nThanks for having me, Brian.\nThis is Dr. Brian McDonough. If you missed any of this discussion, please visit ReachMD.com/primarycaretoday. You can download the podcast. You can learn about the series. Thank you for listening and Being a Part of the Knowledge.\nMany patients face the challenges of obesity and weight loss. With no one-size-fits-all treatment, emerging strategies bring new possibilities.\nObesity rates have been rising for years, resulting in a constant influx of books claiming to have the cure for this newly classified disease. However, it's not just our patients who are dealing with issues of weight. Introducing innovative techniques and approaches is Dr. Lou Aronne, Director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Cornell Medicine.",

A mesmerizing plot and really detailed and wonderful character development, added to the gorgeous scenery of coastal Dorset, kept me riveted through Seasons 1 and 2.\nSo far, they\u2019ve succeeded with The Bletchley Circle, which I got half-way through last night. However, this time, I swear I\u2019m going to ration myself and not serial watch it all this weekend. Does that happen to you?\nIf we were having coffee, I\u2019d ask you to grab your cup and come to the kitchen. Linda just made pancakes! Would you like some with blueberries or without? There\u2019s butter and maple syrup \u2013 help yourself.\nIf we were having coffee, I\u2019d tell you that we had an amazing time at our Burns Supper celebration last week and I\u2019m looking forward both to blogging about it and to making another photo book for all the guests, like I did a few years ago. We\u2019ve got so many awesome pictures and happy memories, it\u2019s nice to gather them all in one place.\nWhich reminds me, while I\u2019m not on an agenda, I guess I kinda am! I need to get working on my book, and I\u2019m feeling fairly inspired, so I\u2019ll thank you for stopping by, remind you to schedule us again for next week and wish you a wonderful weekend full of all the things that make you happy!\nI\u2019d also like to thank Nerd in the Brain \u2013 I\u2019ve enjoyed her \u201cIf We Were Having Coffee\u201d posts so much, it inspired me to brew up a pot and join you all here at #WeekendCoffeeShare.\nThis entry was posted in Blogging challenge and tagged #weekendcoffeeshare. Bookmark the permalink.\nJessica Jones was awwwesome. And Tennant was wildly creepy in that one. Have you watched Daredevil? I liked that one a lot as well, even though the constant physical battery made me a little uncomfortable. Way too realistic.\nWelcome and thanks so much for the coffee and pancakes (please tell Linda, thanks too)! A co-worker of mine loves Broadchurch. She has loaned me a DVD but I haven\u2019t had a chance to watch yet. Sounds like I need to find time! Enjoy your weekend.\nIt is great to meet you and your MIL. I don\u2019t watch TV so I can\u2019t comment on your shows. I was not addict to it as a child. It was available.\nI grew up without TV, I was in college when it started. As your livehood depends on it. I can understand watching it.\nI\u2019d still probably prefer a good book!\nWelcome! Lovely to meet you \u2013 I love that photo of you with the huge smile.\nThat\u2019s my Mother-in-Law, Linda. She does have a lovely smile \u2013 thank you!\nMy husband and I feel so lucky that our families get along so well \u2013 we\u2019ve actually all gotten to be friends (ack \u2013 getting older must do that!) and we have such a great time vacationing and spending holidays together! It is a really wonderful thing and I\u2019ve grown to be very grateful for it.\nI found myself surprisingly mesmerized by Broadchurch \u2013 it really is a very different David Tennant \u2013 but it\u2019s such a fascinating psychological thriller and they take the time to develop the characters \u2013 it\u2019s much more like a visual novel (if that makes sense) verses somewhat typical police dramas that count on sensationalism and violence to build an audience.\nIt does move a little slowly, but it didn\u2019t bother me. You should check out Bletchley Circle as well \u2013 I thought it such an original premise and so far, very enjoyable.\nI\u2019ll definitely have to give both of those a try! I\u2019m at home a lot in the daytime, and I like to have the TV on while I\u2019m working just to keep me company.\nI saw Broadchurch too. Was good. Just as Bletchley Circle. I saw it twice as a matter of fact, once by myself and once with Kim. I have to tell you, it was better with Kim. Everything is better with someone.\nI\u2019m only getting to these right now, nearly a week late. I spent a good chunk of last Sunday watching documentaries on PBS. Most of the time, it\u2019s Star Trek: Enterprise for me, because Trip and T\u2019Pol (I don\u2019t really need any other reason, really, but #itswritingresearch, too!).\nToday is all about Welcome to Night Vale podcasts, because I promised my 11 year old I\u2019d be ready to listen to the next one with her on Monday, but I was over 20 episodes behind, since I was a later adopter than she was. I\u2019m closing that gap, though!\nI hope your visit and break from \u2018growed-up\u2019 things \u2013 and that the book creation was lovely. I enjoyed the coffee but skipped the pancakes, as I\u2019m not a fan.",

    "text": "Act 84 - enacts R.S. 9: 1123.113 to require condominium associations to maintain a fidelity bond and to require providing a notice of the bond when requested by interested parties.\nWhat you should do: Nothing. Simply be aware of this law.\nAct 90 \u2013 amends La. Code Civ. Proc. Art. 2636(5) to allow for a reproduction of a security agreement certified by a financial institution officer to be deemed authentic for purposes of executory process.\nThe statutory authorization for the cancellation and a statement that the affiant has complied with all the requirements of said statute.\nIt must be notarized but need not be in authentic form or witnessed.\nThe filing of the affidavit with the clerk of court shall be authorization for the clerk to cancel the mortgages described in the affidavit.\nThe Clerk shall not be liable for any damages resulting to any person or entity resulting from the cancellation.\nThe affiant is liable to and must indemnify the Clerk. The affiant is subject to civil and criminal penalties for signing a false or incorrect affidavit.\nThe bill provides a sample of the Uniform Cancellation Affidavit. It basically recites the existing methods of cancellation with check boxes for the affiant to check in order to select the method that is being used to effect the cancellation. By signing the affidavit, the affiant attests that he has satisfied all the requirements of the specific law. The Clerk is not required to investigate whether these requirements have actually been met.\nWhat you should know: The importance of this law is to provide a standard form of the affidavit to obtain a release from the clerk of court. The affidavit itself is not the release. Clerks are posting this form on their websites and you should consider its use.\nThe name, address, and Louisiana license number of the issuing title insurance producer.\nThe name of the title insurance underwriter.\nThe name and bar roll number of the attorney who rendered the title opinion upon which a title policy is based.\nThe inclusion of the information shall not create additional liability on those named therein nor will it create a separate cause of action against them. This act is effective January 1, 2012.\nWhat you should do: Be certain that each act and mortgage contains the 3 items set out above. Recall that a part of the purpose of this Act is to provide information as to the attorney who performed the required title examination.\nAct 323 \u2013 amends the Code of Civil Procedure Articles 3421, 3431, 3432 and 3434, dealing with Small Successions. It is a succession or ancillary succession of a person who died leaving property in Louisiana having a gross value of $75,000 or less valued as of the date of death. It shall not be necessary to open judicially the succession of a person who died intestate, or domiciled outside of Louisiana whose testament has been probated by court order of another state. The bill eliminates the requirement that the immovable property left by the deceased be only a single lot or contiguous lots on which there exists a residence in which he or his spouse resided.\nWhat you should know: We are willing to rely on a small succession affidavit without court order completed in compliance with this Act provided you have no reason to believe that the stated value of the estate has been artificially reduced to avoid a court proceeding, this new affidavit can now be used on any type of real estate.\nAct 325 \u2013 amends R.S. 22:512 of the Title Insurance Act dealing with \"Definitions\" in order to define what an \"abstract\" is. Abstract shall mean a written history or summary of the recorded instruments indexed in the public records affecting the title to immovable property that is prepared and certified by an abstractor in accordance with the minimum search periods. It includes a photocopy or electronic copy of such instruments or extracts (take-offs) prepared by the abstractor. The abstractor must date and sign the abstract. \"Public records\" is defined as the mortgage and conveyance records and the property tax records. It allows for an attorney to do a stand-up examination of title. It defines \"title insurance business\" as including the examining of titles. However, any title insurance policy must be based upon an examination of the public records or a personal examination of an abstract by an attorney. The bill also amends R.S. 37:212(A)(2) dealing with the \"practice of law\" to state that it includes the certifying or giving opinions, or rendering a title opinion as a basis of any title insurance reports.\nWhat you should know: You should comply with this Act.\nAct 342 \u2013 amends R.S. 9:5557 to provide for a penalty to be assessed against a lender that does not timely provide a release for a mortgage that has been paid off. It does not apply to a mortgage that has been paid off by the obligor personally, but only to those mortgages paid by a settlement agent. The mortgagee is required to furnish an act of cancellation within 45 days after it receives notice from a settlement agent who has paid the indebtedness or within 45 days of receipt of payment. If the mortgagee does not furnish a cancellation to the settlement agent or cancel the mortgage within 60 days, it is subject to a penalty of $1,000, payable to the borrower. This amount increases by $500 for every 30 days thereafter, up to a maximum of $5,000. If the mortgagee fails to deliver a cancellation within 90 days of the payoff, then the mortgagor may institute summary proceedings against the mortgagee to have the mortgage cancelled. The mortgagor may collect the penalty, costs, attorney fees and damages. The statute is effective for mortgages passed after 2011.\nWhat you should do: Be aware that this Act applies only to a settlement agent. It is a good practice to maintain a calendar entry to remind you to check for a proper return of a release of a mortgage that you have paid and to follow up on such release. If not received by the end of the 90 day period to receive a release, you will need to notify the mortgagee and request that they file the proper suit to obtain the release. If such suit is not timely filed, please notify our claims department.\nAct 461 \u2013 amends La. Code Civ. Proc. Art. 253 (B) and enacts 253 (C) to establish as the official record of any filed document the electronically stored version.\nAttorney General\u2019s opinion 10-0281 \u2013 requires clerks to honor documents electronically certified by other governmental officials, effective February 10, 2011.\nWhat you should do: Nothing. Simply be aware of this opinion.\nAttorney General\u2019s opinion 08-0340 \u2013 authorizes clerks to receive real estate filings electronically.",

    "text": "Leap over the hurdles of tracing Polish roots\u2014our five-step guide will get you started.\nWhat do Marie Curie, Bobby Vinton and Pope John Paul II have in common? If you know their original monikers \u2013 Maria Sklodowska, Stanley Robert Vintula Jr. and Karol Wojtyla \u2013 it\u2019s easy to tell all three had Polish roots.\nNine million Americans share that heritage, making Polish the eighth-largest ancestry in the United States. Poland\u2019s influence on America goes all the way back to the Revolutionary War, when Polish nationalists Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who\u2019d fought unsuccessfully for their homeland\u2019s independence, helped lead Colonial forces to victory.\nThe many immigrants who followed brought along with them a vibrant culture, including recipes for signature dishes such as kapusta (sauerkraut), golabki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (dumplings); ornamental folk dress; and five national dances (Krakowzak, Kulawzak, Mazur, Oberek and Polonez).\nResearching your Polish roots can feel like one of those dances: Sometimes you move forward in rhythm, then a few sudden turns can throw off your footwork. But if you follow the five steps outlined here, you\u2019ll glide gracefully through there search process.\nStep 1: Cover the basics.\nAs with any genealogy search, the best place to begin your Polish research is at home. Scour your attic, basement, closets and desk drawers for documents, letters and photographs with family history clues-in particular, you\u2019re looking for certificates, deeds, passports and other items that might contain details such as immigration information (see step 3) and ancestral hometowns (see step 4).\nNext, interview your relatives to glean additional facts and family lore. Although oral history is never error-free-people\u2019s memories fade and change over time-it\u2019s an essential source for the names, dates and places you need to start your search. Record family stories in a notebook, and be sure to ask your interviewees if they have any photographs or documents, which can provide additional clues.\nThen reach out to the Polish genealogy community for help getting your search on track. Network with fellow researchers on the message boards at <boards.ancestry.com/localities.ceeurope.poland/mb.ashx> and <genforum.com/poland>, and via e-mail lists such as GENPOL <rootsweb.com/~jfulIer/gen-mail-country-pol.html#GENPOL>. Join Polish-focused genealogical societies.\nTry to hook up with relatives in the old country, too. \u201cBecause Polish families tended to be large, it\u2019s inevitable that your immigrant grandmother or great-grandfather left a sibling or two behind when immigrating to America,\u201d says Polish genealogy expert Jonathan D. Shea, a professor of foreign languages at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, Conn. Those siblings\u2019 descendant \u2014 your distant cousins \u2014 could help you fill in the blanks in your family tree. To locate relatives in Poland, search online telephone directories (try the ones at Poland GenWeb <rootsweb.com/~polwgw/wp.html>) or find a printed telephone book covering your ancestral region (most libraries have them) and write to people with your surname.\nStep 2: Learn about Poland\u2019s past.\nPolish history stretches back more than 1,000 years: According to legend, Mieszko I founded Poland in 966. It flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries as the Polish Lithuanian Union, a political entity resulting from Queen Jadwiga\u2019s marriage to Wladyslaw II Jagiello of Lithuania in 1386.\nIn the 1700s, however, Poland\u2019s three powerful neighbors-Austria, Prussia and Russia \u2014 carved up the country in the Three Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793 and 1795). Poland as a nation ceased to exist again until 1918, following World War I; it lost its independence once more during World War II, when the Russian and German offenses ravaged southern Poland and nearly 6 million Poles died. Poland was reborn as the Communist People\u2019s Republic of Poland in 1952, and re-entered the global economy in 1990, as the Rzeczpospolita Polska (Republic of Poland).\nThat turmoil-filled history will color very aspect of your genealogical research, beginning with your family\u2019s arrival in America. The majority of Poles journeyed to the New World during the time Austria, Prussia and Russia ruled their homeland: Immigrants began coming from Prussian-occupied areas in 1848; by the 1880s, the Austrian-governed province of Galicia and the Russian Empire were supplying a steady stream of Polish emigrants.\nThe influx peaked from 1880 to 1910, during America\u2019s \u201cgreat wave\u201d of immigration, with an estimated 3 million Poles in the United States by 1910, If your ancestors were among those immigrants, they didn\u2019t officially come from Poland, but from one of those other three nations \u2014 a fact to keep in mind as you research in immigration records. Because Poland\u2019s territory shrank over time, it\u2019s also possible your Polish forebears came from an area that\u2019s outside the modern nation\u2019s borders.\nStep 3: Determine the immigrant ancestor\u2019s name.\nSpeaking of immigration, your next step in following your clan back to Poland is retracing your immigrant ancestors\u2019 journey to America. To do that, you\u2019ll need to determine their original Polish names-which may or may not be the same ones they used in America. Like other immigrants, Poles sometimes \u201ctranslated\u201d their given names to the English equivalents (Jan becomes John; Katarzyna becomes Katherine). With surnames, they most often altered the spelling or pronunciation: Because Polish orthography is so different from English, immigrants wanted to make their names look and sound more American.\nSince that generally happened after they arrived in the United States, expect your ancestors to appear in earlier records \u2014 including their passenger arrival lists \u2014 with their Polish monikers. This is where it helps to understand Polish naming practices. Polish Roman Catholics, for example, would often name a child after a saint whose feast day was celebrated on or near the baby\u2019s date of birth or baptism. Books can help you determine given names in Latin, Polish and German, and find the proper spellings of surnames.\nAlternatively, you can get passenger lists on micro film at most large public libraries, from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) <archives.gov> and its regional research facilities, and from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 Family History Library (FHL) <www.familysearch.org> in Salt Lake City (rent the film to view at your local Family History Center, or FHC).\nStep 4: Find the ancestral home.\nThis is perhaps the most important step in the research process. To find records from the old country, you need to know where your family lived-just the name of a province or nearby large city isn\u2019t enough, because repositories file records by locality.\nHow do you get it? If you listened closely to your relatives and carefully examined family documents, perhaps you noted the name of a city, village, or at least a county or district that can serve as starting point for further digging. If none of your home searches turned up any clues, you\u2019ll now need to scour other sources to find out where your family came from. Try vital records, obituaries, cemetery and funeral records, church records, censuses, naturalization papers and the Social Security Death Index (also searchable free through Morse\u2019s Web site).\nOnce you have a specific place name, determine its location-along with pre- and post-WWI government and ecclesiastical jurisdictions-using a selection of maps, atlases and gazetteers. Because of Poland\u2019s turbulent history, administrative jurisdictions have changed numerous times. Historically, powiaty (counties)were the basic geographic division; while those still exist, the government introduced wojew\u00f3dztwa (literally, \u201cvoivodeships,\u201d but usually referred to as provinces) in 1975. In 1999, it consolidated Poland\u2019s 49 former wojew\u00f3dztwa into 16. PolandGenWeb\u2019s map <rootsweb.com/-polwgw/49provs.html> can help you sort out that reshuffling. Parish boundaries have shifted overtime, too-and they don\u2019t follow those of political jurisdictions. Gazetteers usually list which jurisdictions a town belonged to.\nThe FHL has an extensive collection of microfilmed maps and gazetteers, which you can find by doing a place search of the online catalog for Poland. When you latersc our the FHL catalog for Polish records (see step 5), be aware that the library uses place names from the 1968 Spis Miejscowosci Polskiey Rzeczypospilitej Ludowej by J. Jodlowska (Wydawnictwo Komunikacji i Lacznosci). Iwo Pogonowski\u2019s Poland: A Historical Atlas (Hippocrene Books) is also a good reference for resolving geographcal questions.\nOnline, try JewishGen\u2019s ShtetlSeeker <www.jewishgen.org/shtetlseeker> search of Eastern European towns, as well as online place-finding tools that focus on particular areas, such as Kartenmeister <www.kartenmeister.com> (Prussia) and Genealogy of Halychyna/Eastern Galicia <www.halgal.com>. You\u2019ll also want to explore the Federation of East European Family History Societies\u2019 Map Room <feefhs.org/newest_map.html>.\nStep 5: Hunt down records.\nNow that you know where your ancestors lived, you\u2019re ready to tackle research in Polish records. Luckily, you can get many of the documents you need \u2014 including vital records \u2014 stateside. As with other European countries, parish records are a staple of Polish genealogical research, as the Polish government didn\u2019t institute civil registration of births, marriages and deaths until 1946.\nThe FHL\u2019s microfilm collection covers parish registers from Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran and Orthodox churches throughout Poland, as well as some Prussian civil registrations (1874 to about 1880). To find those records, do a place search of the FHL catalog for your town name \u2014 be sure to look under both the Civil Records and Church Records headings. Then order relevant films at your local FHC.\nNext, consult other libraries with large Polish collections, such as Central Connecticut State University <www.ccsu.edu>, the New York Public Library\u2019s Slavic and Baltic Division <www.nypl.org> and the University of Pittsburgh <www. pitt. edu>, for materials relating to Polish-Americans\u2019 histories, traditions and communities.\n\u2022 Archives: Records from one registration district could be housed in multiple repositories, including a parish church, archdiocesan archive, local civil-records office or state archive. You\u2019ll want to check all the possibilities, which means getting familiar with Poland\u2019s archive system.\nThe State Archves of Poland-the country\u2019s national archive in Warsaw-is split into the Archive of New Records for post 1945 materials and the Central Archive of Historical Records for earlier documents. In addition, 30 state archives across the country hold records older than 100 years from their respective regions. Visit <archiwa.gov.pl/?CIDA=177> for links to each state archive\u2019s Web site, where you\u2019ll find contact information and a guide to its holdings. The SEZAM <archiwa.gov.pl/?CIDA= 376> and PRAD-ZIAD <archiwa.gov.pl/?CIDA=378> databases are also helpful for determining the locations of various records.\nYou can do research by mail, though PolandGenWeb\u2019s research guide <rootsweb.com/~polwgw/Research.html> cautions that since fees can add up quickly, you should set an upper limit in your request. Your inquiry will have the best chance of meeting with success if it\u2019s concise, specific and written in Polish. The Polish Genealogical Society of America provides several form letters at <pgsa.org/letterwriting.htm>, and you can download the FHL\u2019s Polish Letter-Writing Guide from Family Search (from the home page, click on Guides, then on Letter-Writing Guide). Or hire someone who\u2019s fluent in Polish to write the letter for you.\nLocal civil-records offices (urzedy stanzl cywilnego) are supposed to keep records from the past 100 years, but sometimes you can find older records there. The Polish Genealogical Society of Connecticut and the Northeast <www.pgsctne.org> has an index to vital records in Polish town halls covering 1880 to 1945; you can request a lookup for a small fee.\n\u2022 Religion: Since clergy served as the primary vital-record-keepers in Poland, knowing your ancestors\u2019 faith can help you root out their records more efficiently. Though Poland has been predominantly Roman Catholic, it also had Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population prior to the Holocaust, as well as Lutherans, Orthodox Christians and Greek Catholics.\nMany parishes retain their records rather than forwarding them to a state or church archival repository-and access is purely at the discretion of the pastors. Besides specifically requesting records, you also might try writing to a priest to find out if anyone in the parish has your surname of interest or might remember your family. Just keep in mind the clergy\u2019s interest in your genealogical pursuits can range from great cooperation to flat refusal.\nTo track down diocesan archives and their addresses, use the PolishGenWeb Help Pages at <rootsweb.com/-polwgwlhelppage.html>, Catholic Archives in Poland <www.aap.poznan.pl/index.php?idkat= 52> (in Polish) and Language & Lineage Press\u2019 database of Parish Affilitzons of Villages in the Former Archdiocese of Wilno by Jonathan D. Shea and Diane Szepanski <www.langline.com/Wilno.htm>.\n\u2022 Language: Depending on who was in power where your ancestors lived, their records could be in any of several languages. Records from Russian Poland, for example, were in Polish from 1808 to 1868, then in Russian until Polish independence in 1918. Austrian Poland\u2019s documents were kept primarily in Latin, though you\u2019ll find some Polish- and German-language records. In Prussian Poland, record-keepers used mostly Latin, with some in German and Polish. Read about Catholic record-keeping conventions at <rootsweb.com/~polwgw/pcr.htm>.\nYou probably can\u2019t become fluent in all those tongues, but you can get a working knowledge of genealogical vocabulary by referring to our cheat sheet of basic Polish genealogy terms at <www.familytreemagazine.com/polish>, studying the FHL\u2019s Polish, German and Latin word lists (available on Family Search) and consulting the books in the toolkit. If you\u2019re really ambitious, enroll in a Polish course at a nearby university. You also can contact a Polish genealogical society for a list of translators.\nFeeling the rhythm now? Once you\u2019ve found your groove, you\u2019ll see that keeping pace with your Polish ancestors is easier than you imagined.\nThis entry was posted in Polish Genealogy and tagged pole, vault.

    "text": "Battle: RMK Classic Film Cheeks VS Addiction Cheek Polish. | Midori Kitty Kitty!\nCheck out their separate reviews here: Addiction Cheek Polish & RMK Classic Film Cheeks.\nI get comparing a Limited Edition item with a permanent one is mostly pointless but I\u2019m going to do it anyway.\nAddiction\u2019s Cheek Polish is very pigmented and opaque (quite possibly the strongest in pigmentation among all the other shades available). It\u2019s easy to blend and incredibly smooth. It has a watery consistency and has a very silicone-y feel to it once you start blending it. It is seamless and looks very fresh and natural. I find that it gives you more room for error despite being a very pigmented blush.\nBuy it here: Ichibankao; Everglowcosmetics, Gooddealer, Selfridges, Bonboncosmetics etc.\nThis blush is also very pigmented and opaque\u2026 So much so that if you leave it on your cheeks for a moment too long, it will set and make itself a real pain in the neck to blend. I find that it\u2019s not as seamless as the Addiction one and it looks very unnatural in comparison (but that\u2019s mostly because it is such a bold colour). It has a gel-like texture which I don\u2019t particularly mind. It also doesn\u2019t last very long in humid weather. On cooler days, however, it wears well.\nI bet you can tell that I do not like this. I\u2019m just utterly disappointed by it, considering how it has left such a huge hole in my pocket (I\u2019m still in the process of recovering!).\nPrevious Article\u2190 Review: Etude House Balm + Color Tint in \u2018#4\u2019.\nI\u2019ve been seeing these products on almost all the Japanese girls\u2019 Instagrams that I follow. So glad to have found a detailed review! The Addiction one looks very pretty!",

I am interested in an individual only being able to check files out of the vault to a secured location and not being able to transfer files to another unsecured location. Can this restricted access be applied to a computer with a hard drive or is a terminal required for the level of security?\nWhen a user checks out a file, they are not really checking it out to another location, in the sense of copying it to a different drive. It's true that the PDM system copies the file from the vault to the user's 'local cache', but it only appears to them as a file in their vault view, and as such it is still under the control of EPDM.\nAs far as them copying and pasting files to other locations outside of the vault, AFAIK there's no way to prevent it (as a function of Windows, not EPDM) without the use of third party software.

We do have a lot of warm days in comparison to the rest of the U.S., but no sooner am I preparing for Thanksgiving, does the moisture from my skin begin to deplete.\nLuckily I have my favorite duo of body products to rescue me! For years, I've been using Neutrogena Rainbath ($7.99) refreshing shower and bath gel. It's gentle enough to use year-round no matter how sensitive my skin is, and the fresh fragrance turns my shower into my own personal spa. Speaking of the scent, unlike its fruity and floral counterparts, Rainbath can be enjoyed by both men and women.\nAfter indulging in a warm shower, put some Neutrogena Body Oil ($9.99) on your hands and rehydrate your body with its light sesame formula. At first you might worry, as I did, that it would leave a greasy mess. But it's powerful enough to bring your skin back to life without leaving behind any evidence.\n*Disclosure: I received these products for review, but all thoughts are my own. To be honest, I used these to re-stock my own personal supply!",

    "text": "East Cobb\u2019s Blistering Pope and Walton High Housing Markets \u2013 Spring/Summer 2015!\nThis is a look at two of the hottest hyper-local real estate markets in Marietta\u2019s affluent East Cobb community. Market activity in the Pope and Walton High School Districts have been off the charts so far in 2015. (I will be posting about the Lassiter High District in a future edition.) Historically, the markets in East Cobb\u2019s trifecta high school districts, Walton, Pope, and Lassiter have brisk buyer activity starting in early spring around late February to March. From there as buyers jockey for the ideal home in their chosen school system(s) market activity and buyer competition grows stronger each month, month over month until June/July when things peak and gradually start to cool off.\nI thought 2014 had some very good numbers, and 2015 has been another good year for me, but I had no idea how good the market itself was overall. While doing some research for a special project I parsed the data in these two highly acclaimed high school systems and uncovered stats for sales through July 15th, that not only beat 2014\u2019s numbers, but some took me by complete surprise \u2013 and I live and work here every day! It\u2019s one thing to dig up the data on a particular neighborhood where I am listing a home or helping buyer clients get the best price, but it\u2019s another thing to dig up custom highly targeted housing market data on an entire school system \u2013 or two! I say custom highly targeted data because this level of data granularity is not available in the monthly MLS market reports I get as a Broker/Owner, and it is not posted on any realtor or public website. This level of detail has to be manually/digitally hand extracted using comprehensive and accurate MLS tax and courthouse data!\nSo, what surprised me about 2015 Walton and Pope market data? Several things: 1. The percentage of homes that sold for 98% or better of LP(List Price) \u2013 in-fact, the real surprise was the sheer number of homes that sold for 100% (or more) of the List Price! 2. The number of Days on Market (DOM) \u2013 historically good average DOM for an East Cobb home in good condition and well marketed are 50-70. Most areas in metro Atlanta have far longer average DOM times than this. In 2014 average DOM in these two East Cobb school districts were an exceptional 45 days or so \u2013 very strong. The 2015 Days on Market stats in these two school systems are astounding \u2013 the mid 30\u2019s. That\u2019s very fast \u2013 remember we\u2019re not talking about a specific neighborhood micro market stat \u2013 but an entire housing market! But the real surprise \u2013 the high percentage of homes that sold in 10 days or less, and the majority number \u2013 homes that sold in 30 days or less. I have lived in East Cobb since 1996 and practiced real estate here since 1998 , and I can\u2019t recall such hot overall market numbers.\nAverage Days On Market: 37.8 \u201394 properties sold in only 0 to 30 days from the Listing Agreement \u2013 only 44 properties required over 30 days for a Binding Sale.\n-of 138 properties, 100 sold for at least 95% of List Price \u201369 properties sold for between 98% to *108% of List Price \u2013 *a result of multiple offers on some homes and for others, prices were raised in order to provide some buyer closing costs \u2013 many of the sales exceeding 100% of List were priced in the same exact amount as the seller paid closing cost listed! -Of the 38 properties that sold for less than 95% of List Price, the average List Price vs Sale Price was 91.39 % of List Price.\nAverage Days On Market: 35.7 \u201370 properties sold in only 0 to 30 days from the Listing Agreement \u2013 only 32 properties required over 30 days for a Binding Sale.\n\u2013 85 sold for at least 95% of List Price \u201360 properties sold for between 98% to *106% of List Price * a result of multiple offers on some homes and for others, prices were raised on in order to provide some buyer closing costs \u2013 many of the sales exceeding 100% of List were priced in the same exact amount as the seller paid closing cost listed!\n-Of the 17 properties that sold for less than 95% of List Price, their average List Price vs Sale Price was 90.44% of List Price.\nA ton of useful and in a few cases even unexpected information was gleaned and will be used on behalf of our existing and future buyer and seller clients.\nA similar study was just completed for the summer/fall market in 2014 to see how that data compares with our projections for the upcoming summer /fall market this year. We are expecting at least equal or better results, and insights into specific agent and builder negotiations will be helpful in moving forward.\nTakeaways for Buyers: In these markets, be pre-approved with a lender, be ready to act when the right home is found, and hire the most qualified buyers representative you can find \u2013 the agent/Broker you hire will make or break your deal. Contact an experienced buyers representative to partner with early in the process so they can assist and guide you in the right direction for your family\u2019s needs and lifestyle! Too many buyers start out trying to look around on their own and waste a lot of time before calling an expert. You already have a job \u2013 trying to learn a new career will not serve you? By \u201ctrying to learn the market on your own\u201d you will waste valuable time, look in the wrong places, and ultimately miss out on some great opportunities.\nTakeaway for Sellers: To get top dollar and a quick sale, your home needs to be in well maintained condition, and preferably certain updates have been done. Second, hire the best marketing expert you can find- one who can help you not only get your home in the correct shape, help you stage it if necessary, but can prove an exceptional marketing plan and superior exposure and past results for sellers. *There is a huge difference between seller results and the stats high volume listing machine agents like to boast about \u2013 such as number of transactions per year \u2013 it may sound counterintuitive, but volume only tells how the agent did for themselves \u2013 it says nothing about how their seller clients fared!\nContact me for more information about East Cobb homes, schools, or markets.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged East Cobb Housing Market 2015, Pope High School Homes, Pope Home Market Stats, Walton High School Homes, Walton Home Market Stats, Walton Pope Lassiter by admin.

    "text": "Reads a file that contains ASCII representations of basic data types.\nFull or relative path needed to locate ASCII file.\nA scalar or one-dimensional array specifying the dimension sizes of the data to be read.\nAs of version 6.0.0, dimensions can be of type int or long.\nA string representing the type of the data being read.\nThe asciiread function is used to read ASCII data. If datatype is a numeric type, then non-numeric characters are ignored and the numbers are read in the order they appear in the input file. However, note that for the float and double types, the string 'nan' (any case) is read as a valid numerical value. For all the integer types, the prefix '0x' or '0X' signifies a value represented in hexadecimal (base 16). For the 'byte' type only, the prefix '0', not followed by 'x' or 'X', signifies a value represented in octal (base 8).\nAll numeric types require require a separator. A separator is a non-numeric character [eg, space, comma, alphabetic character].\nFor string data, each line of the file is read as a string.\nFor character data, the file is read byte-by-byte.\nAn error message is generated whenever the number of elements read is less than the number implied by the dimensions parameter.\nIf -1 is given for the dimensions parameter, all values in the file will be read into a one-dimensional variable. The dimension size of this variable will be equal to the number of elements in the file.\nIn version 6.0.0, we fixed a notable quirk in this function: if dimensions was set to explicit dimension sizes, then a _FillValue attribute was returned, equal to the default fill value for that type. If dimensions was equal to -1, then a _FillValue attribute was NOT returned.\nSeveral functions located in contributed.ncl provide additional flexibility for reading ascii files.\nConsider an ASCII file (\"sample.file\") that consists of three \"header\" lines followed by the data array of interest. This file is best read using the readAsciiTable function. However, this example is offered to illustrate how one can read the file directly via the asciiread and ndtooned functions.\nbut this 2nd line has 3 numbers: 10, 30, 50. and a blank line.\nConsider an ASCII file (\"numberByte_ascii.file\") that consists of three rows. Each row has 30 numbers. Unseen at the end of each line is an end-of-line character. Each number is to be interpreted as a numeric type \"byte\".\nThe file can not be directly read as numeric bytes because all numeric types require a non-numeric separator. Also, the 'hidden' end-of-line character complicates the situation. Use of charactertoshort and stringtocharacter can be used to get the desired type \"short\" or \"byte\".\nThe following code snippet will result in each numeric value being separated. The \"ncol+1\" is to account for the hidden end-of-line character. The \"zero_offset\" variable is used to 'normalize' the integer character representation to numeric ibtegers.\nPrinting as byte is done as hexadecimal. The numbers are the same.",

    "text": "This thesis examines the work of reformer Lugenia Burns Hope and her community organization, the Neighborhood Union, as a case study to unpack scholarly characterizations of black elite uplift strategies during the early 20th century. The Neighborhood Union was established in 1908 in Atlanta by Hope and women from the community to build stronger neighborhoods and to combat the deleterious effects of the 1906 Race Riots and Jim Crow laws. Neighborhood Union settlement houses provided basic and extracurricular services, including kindergartens for working mothers, vocational classes, and lecture series. The organization\u2019s exceptional, multi-class leadership structure enabled members of the black poor and working classes to lead their own projects with the assistance of Neighborhood Union resources.\nHope\u2019s background provides evidence against broad generalizations of the black elite as paternalistic, and her vision of creating democratic communities that diminished class barriers provides a counter narrative to characterizations of clubwomen and the black elite as engaging in respectability politics in their social work. Understood within its historical and sociopolitical context, Hope\u2019s life and work also challenge mainstream narratives of the Progressive Era and the Social Gospel movement.\nPierson, Madeleine, \"A Model For Empowerment: Lugenia Burns Hope\u2019s Community Vision Through the Neighborhood Union\" (2016).

    "text": "History seems to indicate that (nearly) every time something new comes along, it is feared, fought or outright rejected dating back even to the first notion that the earth was round (See 1, 2, 3 for a few industry-specific examples). So it now seems for neuroscience and brain-based anything. I've been doing work in this area for nearly 10 years and I still hear how neuroscience is a fad and \"brain-based\" is simply the new hype.\nI don't know about you, but I don't think the human brain is going away anytime soon. So exploring and understanding how it functions (which, it turns out, is often counter-intuitive and contradictory to what we THINK) and how to leverage that understanding can be critical to our success in the classroom, the conference room and the board room.\nBrain-based, as we use the term, refers to applying neuroscience research to our ideas, our programs, essentially most of what we do at Laurie Carey Consulting. It is driven by the primary organizing principle of the brain as put forth by Evian Gordon--minimize danger and maximize reward, with minimize danger being the MUCH STRONGER default.\nBeing brain-based means paying attention to everything you think, say and do in terms of whether you are creating dangers or rewards for the brain. The challenge is that so much of what we think, say and do can be rather \"thoughtless\" (researchers estimate between 50% and 95% of our brain activity is non-conscious; see 4 and 5 for related research). There are good evolutionary reasons for this. It takes energy to think and we humans like to conserve energy to respond to threats (there's that dang primary organizing principle again). So finding ways to \"automate\" processes allows us to minimize energy consumption. It also means we can say and do things that create a trigger to others' brains that we are a danger.\nWhen was the last time someone cut you off in traffic, or jumped ahead of you in a line, or lightly challenged your idea, or left you off of a meeting invite or ... ? How did it feel to you? What did it cause you to think or say or do? Chances are, it elicited a slight (or possibly greater) negative chain reaction. This negative reaction, often referred to as a \"fight or flight\" response, further diminishes our cognitive functioning and can result in even more non-conscious reactions.\nWhat does \"coaching\" have to do with this?\nIt turns out, taking a coaching or coach-like approach can be VERY brain-friendly IF the coaching approach is a brain-based coaching approach. Just as there are many people questioning the value of neuroscience, there are MANY people calling themselves coaches. Unfortunately, many of these folks are actually providing a service that is closer to mentoring, consulting or training--and there are significant differences. A coach is supposed to let the client \"do the heavy lifting\" and it is supposed to be a client-driven relationship, meaning the client is in charge. The coach provides the \"space\" to approach goals, topics, issues, situations, whatever in a different way. It is less about what the coach knows and more about tapping into the client's ability.\nMany coaches take a directive approach, offering suggestions, hints, ideas, thoughts ... to the client. While this can be helpful in some (and I'd say the minority of) situations, it tends not to be very brain-friendly. Giving people advice or telling them what to do (even if done in a \"helpful\" way) can still trigger danger to the hyper-sensitive brain. Even the questions a coach asks can trigger danger depending on the nature, focus and type of question asked.\nThird, it means using a brain-friendly framework for connecting with others that works with--rather than against--the brain. You might be surprised at how easy it is to get it wrong (or you might just be non-conscious, wink).\nAnd finally, it takes LOTS of attention and practice. The human brain has been evolving for centuries; I've only got a decade of brain-based practice. How about you?\nJoin us in an upcoming program or event if you want to begin to develop or strengthen your brain-based coaching skills.\n\"The Neural Basis of the Dynamic Unconscious\"",

You think you\u2019ve finally found the right one, but then you still have to get through the interview and the dreaded salary negotiations.\nKnow what you can offer \u2013 Whether you have an HR professional in your midst or hiring falls squarely on your shoulders, have an idea of what pay is fair, based on the job requirements and availability of candidates who can do the job. You should also consider what others in your company make who have similar jobs. People talk and you can\u2019t forbid them from talking money with one another.\nResearch \u2013 Candidates usually expect a higher salary than their last and occasionally \u201cmodestly inflate\u201d that last salary amount. Do you know if their salary makes sense based on their most recent job? Is the salary for their most recent job commensurate with the job you have for them? Was it high because they were a long-term employee?\nGet Creative \u2013 Just because your \u201cfixed pay\u201d range may not be flexible, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t consider signing bonuses, guaranteed commission or incentive plans, or other \u201cvariable pay\u201d options to try to lock in the best candidate. Find out what else is important (i.e., paid time off, modified work schedules, etc\u2026) and see what you can come up with to make a richer offer.\nIn the end, salary negotiation is a two-way street that can be a little bumpy for both parties. With the right preparation, honesty and desire to get the right person, hiring managers can make salary negotiations a little easier for everyone involved.\nThis entry was posted in Negotiations and tagged hiring managers, itac solutions, job search birmingham, salary negotiation.

It was produced a few weeks before the Redbud Chapter of the California Native Plant Society conducted their annual Native Plant Sale. It helped tell the story about the importance of native plants in the Deer Creek Watershed and promote the event.\nSince most of my work is digital, time and hydroelectric generated power (as well as computing hardware) are the main production resources involved in making these creations.\nAs I do background research for posts, I also generate an art piece. At the time of this writing, 62 designs are in the Life on the Creek collection.\nWhile I started with graphic designs involving text, Latin names, and waves, several recent posts inspired a new layout direction.\nPony Express help wanted advertisement.\n\u2018Pony Express Riders\u2019 is a blending of a public domain map and a help wanted advertisement. This came about after discovering that Joaquin Miller, Poet of the Sierras (and a mining camp cook who developed scurvy for the post Scurvy in California\u2019s Food Capital) was also a Pony Express rider.\nThe extinct and disrupted Life on the Creek designs are from the posts Grizzly Entertainment and California Bear Extinction, and Dammed Disrupted Salmon.\n*In the newer designs, you may notice an absence in the \u201d wording at the bottom of the Following Deer Creek logo. These pieces were created after I moved the website from a free site to a paid site in an attempt to reduce unwanted advertising clutter.\nFineArtAmerica.com hosts my artwork online and produces made-to-order prints and household items.\nAt my Open Studios Tour booth (#30) October 13th and 14th, I will have a number of these pieces on display.\nProminently featured will be Space Invaders \u2013 Invasive Species pieces that will be donated to Sierra Streams Institute (SSI).\nSSI will be using them as incentive gifts for community Scotch Broom pulls that they will be organizing in the fall.\nArt for a cause\u2026while attempting to lessen resource use\u2026is very satisfying!",

    "text": "A few months ago, our office switched its e-mail over to a business version of gmail. One of the features of our new e-mail is that a little colored circle is displayed by each person\u2019s name showing whether he or she is online.\nI have to admit, I really like it when I see other people on staff with the green circle by their names. According to Google, this means they are \u201cavailable.\u201d Because I work from home, it\u2019s easy to start feeling isolated and alone as I complete my tasks each week. But when I see those green lights next to other people\u2019s names it makes me feel like I\u2019m part of a team.\nOne person might be in the office. Someone else is at Caribou. Another person might be working from home. But we are all working together. For the same goal. And I don\u2019t feel so alone.\nYesterday my green light was on almost all day. The boys were at camp. My daughter had a play date. The toddler was happily playing or napping most of they day. So I took advantage of the time to get caught up on a ton of work.\nI was sending and receiving e-mail and working away as if everything was peachy. But I was fighting a nasty cold and felt horrible all day. I was tempted to set a custom message by my green light: \u201cCough, cough. Sneeze, sneeze. Please feel sorry for me.\u201d It just seemed wrong that my green dot was shining brightly as if everything was perfect when I was really struggling.\nAnd isn\u2019t that how it often goes in our real, offline world, as well?\nMost of us at least try to put on the green light when we are out in public. We smile and joke. We pull ourselves together. We walk around with our big \u201cavailable\u201d button shining brightly. But wouldn\u2019t it be kind of nice if we could change our status to put out a warning of what is really happening on the inside?\nLast Saturday, I was watching my daughter\u2019s soccer game, along with the toddler and my 8-year-old son. My husband had to take the 10-year-old to another field for his game. It was hot. We were hungry. It was naptime. It was humid. There wasn\u2019t a shade tree in sight.\nIt had been a struggle to get everyone where they needed to be, and I was just relieved that the toddler had found a little hill about 10 feet away from me that was keeping her busy. She loved marching up the tiny incline and then running back down it. At the top of the hill, a woman was sitting in a lawn chair next to a building, which was giving her a little shade.\nMy son was hovering nearby to make sure the toddler didn\u2019t wander too far or fall down.\nMy son nodded, as I headed over to prove the baby really did have a mother.\n\u201cWell, you better put that baby in the stroller before her head gets sunburned,\u201d she ordered.\nI assured the woman I had covered her in sunscreen.\nAt that moment, my light turned bright red. My green light was done. Off. Finished.\nI wasn\u2019t going to bother explaining that I had tried six times to get the toddler to keep a hat on her head. It would serve no purpose to try to tell her that I\u2019m neurotic about applying sunscreen. Or that confining the 18-month-old to a stroller for an hour when it was 98 degrees outside would have created such a loud protest that she would be begging me to release the child from her confinement.\nI was just relieved we had succeeded in getting all four children where they needed to be at the right time. I was happy that no one was crying. I was overjoyed the toddler was having fun running up and down the hill so I could actually observe a few minutes of the game. I had zero desire for anyone in the family to get a sunburn, and even though it did look like she was probably going to be burned to a crisp, I had enough experience as her mom to trust that the extra coating of sunscreen was going to work.\nThe whole interaction was a good reminder to me. I need to take more time to find out what people have gone through to get to the place they are. They might look pretty and put together with their nice green light shining on the outside. But a harsh word or an unsolicited comment might just knock them over.\nI need to remember that not everyone is \u201cavailable\u201d for whatever I might feel like throwing their way. Green light, or not.\nAnd it's sad that all I took away from that is how I wanna pop that lady in the head for the whole sunburn thing!! I have a saying when it comes to obvious comments from others that degrade my abilities and it's \"big dummy\"! When someone let's me know I'm \"doin it wrong\" I always whisper to myself \"yeah ya big dummy\"!!! Then laugh at them cuz they r really the \"big dummy\"!! This doesnt make sense I bet\u2026 I do that often!\nOh, Andrea\u2026 You totally crack me up! Thanks for making me laugh!!\nGreat post Emily! I needed this reminder as well.\nGreat thoughts, thank you! I do kind of want to smack that woman though\u2026 haha!\nGood advice Andrea! I guess I just need a preconceived response to comments like that. You are a great writer, Emily.",

    "text": "What actions might be needed to jump start the tourism industry in Pohnpei?\nI believe much has been said about this topic in the past. However, I'd like to bring it up again; so that we can have a new and fresh look at it again. I hope those who are in the know about this subject matter--would contribute to this discussion.\nFirst, tour operators used to say that Pohnpei airport was too short for charter flights. Well, the airport was extended several years ago with financial assistance and technical assistance from Japan.\nSecond, others use to complain that there is not enough room. Well, there is a new couple of storey hotel building in town. We probably have over 300 rooms available--more or less--Cliff, Ocean View, the new Hotel, Joy and others.\n1. If there is already a serious and comprehensive report on how to start the tourism industry in Pohnpei, I am asking anybody to let us know; so that we can read it and update it; or take some actions accordingly.\n2. I am assuming that a complete and good report does not exist. As such, let me offer some ideas: a) a tourism market analyst should look at the resources that Pohnpei has to offer; and b) determine whether they could attract certain type of tourists from China or Korea or Japan or America or Europe or where.\n3. The question is whether at least one charter flight could be arranged from either Japan, Korea or China per week? If we start with that assumption, what are the necessary actions to take in order to accomodate the planes requirements; and to accomodate the tourists; and make them occupied or happy or contented for at least 3 days; before they return home.\nThese are my initial comments and suggestions for now. Is it possible or not to have a modest number of tourists to come to Pohnpei consistently--every week--for a whole year at a time? If possible, then, we should go for it. Any other observations and suggestions would be appreciated.\nThe public could give the Pohnpei Visitors\u2019 Bureau a big pay raise and a bigger round of applause. If not, then try the opposite or something else, but don\u2019t do nothing and expect something. For example, the US national debt was doubled; the jobs were going over-seas; so the Americans tried a different approach to the problem. They elected a billionaire CEO instead of the customary career politician. Like the idiom goes, \u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\u201d So they tried someone very different from your ordinary politician. Of course, the world is still full of insane people, who demand the usual approach to a growing problem. But that's another topic.\nAnyway, that is my two cents and I hope you would appreciate it, like you said that you would. There is much left unsaid about the complex issue of tourism. Other Micronesians should contribute in this discussion, rather than in those they detest.\nSo I heard that for Guam tourism, the Korean tourists are known to prefer smaller hotels, not the fancy big ones. And they also don't spend as much. On the other hand, the Japanese tourism prefer to stay in the large hotels; and do spend a lot per visitor. Whether this distinction is related to the tourist promoters who are linked the particular hotels, it'll be good to know. It's not good to make such generalizations. I don't know what can be said of the Chinese tourists or US tourists or Russian tourist.\nI think if we really want to try to develop Pohnpei tourism, we need, first of all, to understand such preferences of the different groups as tourism targets; and at the same time, we need to know if Pohnpei can provide what the particular group would find as contributing to their positive tourism experience. So this is the basic principle of business an marketing analysis; and is needed before we can begin to design the tourism program and promotion.\nSo that is my first recommendation. Just some thoughts on this nice and noisy New Year's day--Jan. 1, 2019.\nFirst and foremost Tourism critically require CLEANLINESS! Our Environment must be presentably clean without artificial rubbish. Our Air, Ocean, Rivers, streams, shores and riversides must be clean. Appropriate infrastructure must also be in place. Build it and they will come. We must invest heavily into advertisements locally and globally. Preserve our Customs and Traditions. Not what is happening today where the Tourist would come and see the traditional Leaders sitting infront in Western clothing. For Pohnpei this is what it needs for Tourism to move forward.\nDid you say that we need clean up our environment and rake our yards? Well, I'll be damned! Trump was right all along!\nSo I am looking for a tourism study that shows and analyzes the \"segmentation\" of the potential tourism targets. Tourism, like any product lines--such as soft drink, beer, food products--could be more understood if a \"marketing study\" shows the segmentation of the potential market including desirable and undesirable behaviors; spending patterns; tolerance for long flights; desire for shopping vs. visiting cultural sites; duration of vacation days per different groups; what would constitute a happy tourist; etc., etc.\nNeedless to say, once you understand your potential customers--it'll be easier to improve the sites where the tourists would visits; etc., etc.,. So the question is this: does Pohnpei have the basic assets that could be developed or improved--so that the different segments of the tourism population could be attracted to visit?\nTourism matters. Don\u2019t count the US out. We have A LOT of eco-tourists who snorkel and dive. Does FSM have the logistical capability of handling 300 avid snorkelers and divers at a time? Protect the mangroves and reefs; without them you will be left with a deserted ocean.\nIs it possible to Charter a non-stop flight out of Los Angeles? If so then running ads in the diving and adventure magazines might allow you to fill those planes. Sundays out of LA and back on Saturdays would allow connections to be made to any destination in the US; with the folks leaving their offices on a Friday and returning to work on a Monday. Perhaps use the planes for domestic flights during the week. Does Yap and Chuck have airports large enough to handle those kinds of aircraft?\nBeyond tourism: FSM has one of the largest exclusive economic zones on the planet.\nI can imagine as a small country your fish and ocean resources are being exploited with very little return to FSM itself. The fishing boats should be flagged in FSM. The workers on the boats should be Micronesian, the processing plants should be Micronesian; and those ocean resources should be closely monitored and aggressively protected. I know how this world works; I am confident you are receiving a few pennies on the dollar of economic return.\nWhat percentage of capital outflow is represented in diesel fuel imports for energy production? Given topography and climate that is about as big a waste as I can imagine. Given your cost of energy; tidal, solar, and wind could be gold plated and still be more profitable than diesel generation. But more imporantly it would stem the hemorage of capital those imports represent.\nCapitalize your own banks and businesses. That single action would probably be the second most effective way in stemming capital outflow and encouraging capital formation.\nInvest locally and use reinvestment to grow; it is the only way you will be free; and that matters.\nSo, yes, US divers is just one segment of the possible many segments of the tourism market. I am assuming this segment, if you look at it closely, will have its own characteristics and behavior and spending patterns that would be very different from other segments such as tourists from China or Korea or Japan, etc.\nThe question is what kinds of assets or attractions does Pohnpei have--or that can be developed--to cater to this segment of the tourism industry.\nFirst, is the cost: there are closer destinations such as Belize, the Carribean islands, etc. which will cost less, in terms of airline costs, to visit compared to the price of the tickets to Pohnpei and back.\nSecond, what about the attractions for tourists: will the US-based divers be willing to bypass Hawaii and its other islands--to come to Pohnpei. Do we have such hot diving spots in Pohnpei to compete with other diver destinations? I think it's limited.\nThese and more are some of the items in the list to be evaluated if were we to try to focus on this segment of the market. It is doable but we need to make a good case as to why the US-based divers would be attracted to come to Pohnpei and not other less expensive and accessible destinations that have more to offer.\nI don't want to sound negative. American divers have a lot of money to spend compared to other segments of the tourism population so it should be seriously considered. It'll be good to hear from marketing experts regarding this segment and as to whether or not, it should be the focus of the Pohnpei tourism promotion drive. Just some ideas.\nHas anybody considered cruise-lines. I hate traveling in airplanes for long durations.\nA service based economy would certainly not be a first choice.\nThe South Pacific has multiple times the number of fauna and flora species than the Caribbean Basin.\nI thought Pohnpei had healthy coral reefs and good water clarity. That is the only attraction needed to attract divers and snorkelers from around the world. Has the entire planet been trawled with bottom nets? I was hoping a few spots were missed. Flora and Fauna is what the world wants to experience; it is that simple. Unfortunately the density of both flora and fauna in our oceans is rapidly decreasing.\nIf there are healthy coral reefs with large numbers of fish then imagine a market where the product is exposure to the most species of flora and fauna on the planet. It sounds foolish to use scarce capital to hire marketing experts for such a rare market. That is like saying you don\u2019t know what you have in your hands.\nPohnpei will never be able to compete with the highly sophisticated and highly profitable casinos in places like Las Vegas, Macau, Hong Kong, Monaco, London, etc.\nA tourist attraction unique to Pohnpei is Nan Madol, a United Nations World Heritage site. But until it is restored and maintained, made more accessible to visitors of all ages, and supported with world class tour guides, lodging, and restaurants, not many people will spend thousands of dollars to visit the place.\nSo if casino is out, what is it that might attract Chinese or other gamblers to Pohnpei? I don't see any.\nCruise liners is one possible ways to bring tourists in. But I don't think somebody will deliberately get on a cruise-liner with Pohnpei destination solely in mind. What we can do is for our tourism promoters to contact the cruiseliner operators that pass thru our waters--so they can make a scheduled stop on Pohnpei port for a couple of days. I heard that some of these cruise-lines go to Guam or Saipan and other destinations in our neighborhood. So it might be possible to find ways to get them to stop, more often, or on a regular basis at Pohnpei port.\nWhat about Korean visitors or Japanese visitors? We do have some Japanese visitors that come thru on a more regular basis. There are Japanese-speaking local tour operators who are equipped to hold Japanese tourists--if or when they come.\nBut I am beginning to think that we need to approach the development of the Pohnpei tourism in a slightly different way. I don't think our own government agencies and employees--who are tasked to promote and attract tourists--can do the job. It's not that they are not qualified. It's just the way the mass tourism market work.\nIf we want to bring in, say, 200 to 300 tourists to Pohnpei on a charter flight, I think we need to have the involvement of tour packagers or tour promoters--located where the possible tourists are.\nThe promoters will be the ones to advertise the tour packages; arrange for flights when there are about 200 to 300 interested tourists. They can facilitate and make bookings with the local Pohnpei hotel from their offices in Japan or S. Korea; and even plan out, example, a 3-day package. The tour operators are the ones who know the needs and desires of different tourists group. So they will be the ones who we can depend on the make the arrangements.\nIt may mean that our governments will need to find partners who are tour operators; and pay them certain amount plus commission in order for them to sell Pohnpei as destination.\nI think tourists visiting out-o- the-way places like Pohnpei would like to be dealing with reliable and trustworthy tour operators--for their safety and for assurance about the value of their vacations.\nSo I don't know what assets or attractions(?) are there in Pohnpei to attract a certain group. We still need to conduct tourist marketing studies, the segmentation of the market. In the end, we want some sort of tourist profiles as per different countries as segmented by age group, family group, environmental study group, historical study group, divers group, etc., etc.\nIn short, I think we need to develop working relationship and compensation package agreement with tourist promoters. We need to bring some of them to Pohnpei to look at our assets; and advice us on how to improve Pohnpei; so that future tourists will be satisfied once they get here. Just some thoughts.\nBesides the Nan Madol World Heritage site, FSM has spectacular sport fishing and scuba diving to attract tourists.\nWWII artifacts and shipwrecks can also attract both Japanese and American families with WWII historical connections.\nAnd yes, we need experienced tourism industry professionals to propose marketing strategies for possible implementation....IF the people and the government are really serious about tourism, that is.\nSo far, I haven't seem much evidence of serious interest, sad to say.\nFM, I agree that FSM has many attractions that could draw tourists to visit. But for business strategy, I think the government officials who are responsible for tourism policies should really work with professionals--so that the different FSM states' attractions will be identified and amplified--for the purpose of differentiating each one as a unique destination in itself. I say this because when we say FSM, it means a large region; so it'll be difficult for tourist to be able to visit all the destinations in the FSM.\nSo, let's say that a typical tourist--from Japan, S. Korea, US, Europe, Russia, etc.,--has only 3 days for vacation. How do we attract those kinds of visitors to a particular destination. I would say that we should assume that these tourists with only 3-day vacation time will only be going to one destination--whether it's Pohnpei or Chuuk or Yap or Kosrae--in the case of the FSM. Of course, other competing destinations for the 3-day vacationers are Hawaii, Guam, Palau, Saipan, RMI and other nearby locations.\nSo for the FSM, we need to define the potential destinations within the FSM. We can say that Pohnpei is unique because of its Nan Madol ruins plus its diving spots. Chuuk is unique because of the World War II wrecks. Yap is unique because of its traditional money and its sting ray alley. Also, Kosrae has its own ruins and special forests, etc.\nIn short, we need to understand, on one hand, the tourists profiles and segmentation; so we can target the different segments--in order to lure them to the spectacular and unique attractions within each of the FSM states. On the other hand, we need to define our destinations in a way that they will attract the different segments of the tourism population. Just some thoughts but I am sure these are already well understood by government officials responsible for tourism development and promotion. Hope so.\nOf the three Freely Associated States, only Palau has a thriving tourist industry.\nBoth the FSM and the RMI would be wise to learn from the ROP how to effectively attract tourists.\nIn the meantime, fisheries remain our only significant income-producing industry....and that income will continue to fluctuate annually due to tuna migration and global warming.\nI learn much on tourism from your comments, but I sometimes feel you are leap frogging. I think Factsmatter pointed out a problem which is the lack of \"serious interest.\" Shouldn't we address this problem first? Does anyone know why Micronesians, excluding Belauans and Chamorros, lack the motivation to develop their tourism industry? For example, lack of physical fitness, low energy, or maybe poor diet is to blame. Too much substance abuse maybe? Too content with no dreams or visions for greatness? Too lazy? Don't want to change lifestyle or develop self? Land's too sacred to be developed or discussed? Bored of same old leadership? Not enough public lands like in Koror and the Marianas?\nAre Micronesians really free men and women? If so, then why are we not \"seriously interested\" in building up our tourism, economy and country? Maybe we just don't like tourists and want to be left alone, like most conquered peoples living in injun reservations. Or maybe we dread the ecological, cultural, and economical impacts of tourism. Anyway, I think we should also consider the public's opinions, especially the local communities' and land owners,' when planning these ventures. Because everyone will be impacted.\nz, yes, you are making a lot of good points. I am hoping that by engaging in serious discussions about Pohnpei tourism, we can come to some conclusions; and some answers to questions which you have raised. I don't want to believe that Pohnpeians are lazy or don't want development thru tourism. But I also don't have an answer as to how to develop tourism in Pohnpei--to a level similar to Palau or Guam, etc.\nMaybe some of the reasons that you say are correct. But I am not sold yet on the idea that we are the cause of our own problem--our attitude, our way of life, low energy, etc.\nIn the end, it might prove that tourism--in the volume comparable to Palau or Guam--simply cannot occur in Pohnpei for the following reasons which have been mentioned by different people--some in this Forum, etc.\nPohnpei does not have the beaches that attract family-type tourists. Pohnpei is too far out of the way; so it'll take many vacation hours spent on the plane; so it does not attract people with only 3-day vacation. Pohnpei does not have large shopping centers such as those in Guam (Walmart, Duty-Free, etc). While Nan Madol is one of the best place in the world to visit, it would only take probably a couple of hours to make a tour to Nan Madol; and what do you do after that.\nAnother problem that I see is restrictions for hiring quality service people, such as workers from the Philippines, to come work in Pohnpei. It is difficult to recruit these workers because they also have to get US visa just to transit thru Guam a couple of hours in order to go to Pohnpei.\nIn contrast, Palau has good beaches although you have take boats to the nice rock island beaches. But some of the hotels in Koror have built artificial beaches by the hotels to cater to their tourism customers. The population of Palau is small; so the number of Palauans working for tourism is small. Most of the service workers such as waitress at restaurants, cooks, etc, are from the Philippines. And it's easy for Palau to bring in workers from PI because they don't have to go thru Guam--so they don't need to apply for visa which is costly as well as time consuming. Most importantly, Palau has been able to maintain its clean environment which is appreciated by the tourists.\nSo should Pohnpei give up on tourism because it does have the same assets and attractions as Palau or Guam? At some point in time, the leadership has to decide. I would say that we still need experts on tourism development and marketing and promotion to visit Pohnpei under contract with the Pohnpei State or with the FSM. They still need to do assessments of our assets and attraction sites. They need to help us figure as to whether or not our assets and attractions can be good enough to attract a certain segment of the tourism population.\nWe don't have to have mass tourism although the airport has been extended to accommodate charter flights. We might be able to focus on smaller number of visitors; and then, build from there. We'll see.\nDoes anyone know why Air Niugini and Air Nauru do not want to land in Guam? Only Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, South Korean, and Philippines airlines like to land in Guam. Why is this? Anyone know why Air Niugini and Air Nauru hate Guam so much?\nDisregard everything that you are talking about with regards to tourism in the FSM. Let us explore this question instead. Why does the US Government allow Japanese, Chinese, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Philippine airlines to land in Guam but not Air Niugini and Air Nauru? Is it because the pilots have curly hair? Why is this?\nI think any airline that wants to fly to any country must be able to meet that country's standard. In order to fly to Guam or Honolulu, the aircraft must meet US safety standard; pilots must meet training and retraining requirements. The airline must also have an office and crew at the airport; to service the plane and customers. It probably can contract other airlines to provide these services at the beginning.\nIt also probably need to lease or own those ramp walkway that are moved to connect to the plane once in place; for customers to work thru to the airport--unless you have a small aircraft which only requires customer to exit the plane; and walk on the airport open air to the building. The 2 airlines that you are talking about probably don't have the volume of customers to Guam--to be able to invest on the required infrastructure. It probably does not have enough revenue to meet insurance requirements.\nLastly, I am sure the business competition from United or other more established US carrier will always be a factor. I heard that United--like the Continental before it-- keeps reducing its ticket prices whenever Air Nauru tried to have flights to Guam or other destinations in Micronesia-in order to undercut Air Nauru's attempt to get a foothold of the Guam market.\nSo I am sure it has nothing to do with \"curly hair\" but more on stiff competition; as there are other \"curly hair\" pilots in United and other carriers that come to Guam.\nAir Niugini has been trying to get landing rights into Guam since 1970s. However, for some strange reason, the US Government never grants them landing rights, despite the fact that it grants landing rights to Asian country airlines from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Philippines.\nWhat would be the reason for not granting landing rights to Air Niugini? Please tell us because I think you already know this.\nWe just need to justify why should a tourist fly over Guam and Hawaii to come to FSM. Once we can get that traveler to FSM, we will have tourist.\nGood question. I think some smart person--with practical experience in tourism program planning and strategizing--might be able to provide some answers. Or, it'll be a combination of experts in business development and marketing strategies; or some people from Japan or S. Korea who actually have real life experience with packaging tours from their countries to Pacific islands nations such as Guam, Hawaii, CNMI. People with such expertise could be paid as consultant--to put some of their recommendations together to answer the question above.",

    "text": "An archaeologist from The Australian National University (ANU) has uncovered the world's oldest known fish-hooks placed in a burial ritual, found on Indonesia's Alor Island, northwest of East Timor.\nDistinguished Professor Sue O'Connor from the School of Culture, History and Language in the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific said the discovery turns on its head the theory that most fishing activities on these islands were carried out by men.\n\"These are the oldest known fish-hooks associated with mortuary practices from anywhere in the world and perhaps indicate that fishing equipment was viewed as essential for transition to the afterlife in this area,\" Professor O'Connor said.\n\"The discovery shows that in both life and death, the Pleistocene inhabitants of the Alor Island region were intrinsically connected to the sea, and the association of the fish-hooks with a burial denotes the cosmological status of fishing in this island environment.\"\nPrior to the find, the earliest fish-hooks associated with a burial site date back only about 9,000 years and were found in a river environment of the Mesolithic era in Siberia, known as the Ershi cemetery.\nProfessor O'Connor said in a maritime context, the earliest burials with fish-hooks are from Oman, where rotating fish-hooks made of pearl shell have been dated to about 6,000 years ago.\nOlder fish hooks from Japan, Europe and East Timor date back as far as 22,000 years, but they were not related to burial rites.\nIn the Alor Island find, two different types of fish-hooks were buried - a J-Shaped hook and four circular rotating hooks fashioned from the shell of a species of sea-snail.\nProfessor O'Connor said the appearance of the Alor rotating fish-hooks so early on a disconnected island suggests that several fishing communities developed the same technology separately, rather than learning from each other through contact.\n\"The Alor hooks bear an uncanny resemblance to rotating hooks used in Japan, Australia, Arabia, California, Chile, Mexico and Oceania,\" she said.\n\"We argue that the same sort of artefact was developed independently because it was the most fitting form to suit the ecology, rather than through cultural diffusion.\"\nProfessor O'Connor's findings were published in the Cambridge University Press journal Antiquity.\nThe research was funded through the Australian Research Council's Kathleen Fitzpatrick Australian Laureate Fellowship.",

    "text": "Do you have a DIY will or are you thinking about making one?\nEveryone has probably seen or heard of the DIY will kits you can pick up at newsagents or the post office. Some of you may even have used one to make your own homemade will. You followed the instructions and a will is a will, right? Not quite. A recent matter we had highlighted the dangers of DIY when it comes to making a will.\nMrs Oliver* was in her late eighties when she passed away. She was widowed but left behind four children, three daughters and a son, and a will she had made on a DIY will kit. She had filled it in herself, in her handwriting, and asked two of her elderly neighbours at her retirement village to act as witnesses.\nShe had a solicitor she knew so she nominated his law firm as her executor.\nMrs Oliver had left all her estate to her son and one of her daughters and it was well known that she had done this because the other two daughters were very comfortable financially. Fortunately, she had discussed this with the children and they were happy with their Mother\u2019s wishes.\nEither at that time or at some later time, Mrs Oliver decided she probably should leave a little something to the other two daughters and handwrote at the end of the will leaving them each some jewellery.\nFast forward 15 years and Mrs Oliver passed away. The children located the homemade will and asked us to administer the estate.\nProblem No. 1 \u2013 You cannot appoint a law firm as an executor.\nWe contacted the law firm listed as executor and the principal of the firm had since retired. His son was now the principal of the firm and was not interested in being the executor. We requested that he sign a renunciation of executorship, and while he agreed in the first instance, he then started failing to answer and return calls and after significant chasing, it became clear he would not cooperate.\nProblem No. 2 \u2013 You cannot amend a will after you execute it by just writing on it, even if you initial the changes.\nThe court naturally picked up that the will had been written in two different pens. Now it was not immediately clear whether Mrs Oliver had written the will in one sitting with two different pens or whether the second pen was amendments she had made at a later time. The court wanted to hear from the witnesses.\nProblem No. 3 \u2013 You are best to pick witnesses that have a reasonable chance of outliving you.\nWe managed to locate the witnesses after much searching. One had died and the other was living in a nursing home with dementia and no memory of Mrs Oliver or her will.\nProblem No. 4 \u2013 If you pass away and were suffering from an illness which affects your mind, proof is needed that you were in your right mind when you made the will.\nTo top it off, the death certificate listed dementia as a cause of death. Therefore, we had to prove to the court that at the time the will was made, and arguably at the time it was amended, Mrs Oliver knew exactly what she was doing and was not yet suffering the effects of dementia.\nOne of the daughters stepped in and agreed to act as administrator. We applied for Letters of Administration for her but had to provide additional evidence to the court about what had happened with the named executor.\nWe also had to provide an affidavit from the solicitor who had located the original witnesses as to why they could not give evidence.\nWe then had to have each of the children provide an affidavit confirming the will was in their Mother\u2019s handwriting, it did express her intentions as she had discussed with them around that time, at the time she appeared to be of sound mind and that her dementia did not commence until later. To add complexity, one of the daughters now lived overseas so having her affidavit witnessed was particularly difficult.\nFortunately, as Mrs Oliver had died such a long time after making the will, the court did not require an affidavit from her doctor at the time confirming she was of sound mind. It would have likely been difficult if not impossible to locate the doctor, particularly if they were older and had since retired or died.\nNeedless to say, the few hundred dollars Mrs Oliver saved in doing her own will ended up costing thousands of dollars at the other end.\nThe happy ending for this one was that Letters of Administration were finally granted and the instructions in the will were able to be carried out to the letter. Most times the ending is not so happy.\nThe moral of the story: Don\u2019t engage in the false economy of a homemade will. The heartache and expenses you leave behind for those you love is not worth it and in the worst case, you will leave them in a worse position than if you hadn\u2019t even made a will at all.",

    "text": "After more than a year and a half without a contract, Oakland teachers are preparing to vote on a strike. But teachers frustrated with how slowly the formal bargaining process works say they want to show the district they're willing to strike. So for the second time in two months some teachers plan to call in sick en masse Friday in what they\u2019re calling a \"sickout.\"\nHayes listed grievances that ranged from the proliferation of charter schools in Oakland to the state of school facilities. He has helped organize the action and says he's heard from teachers at 10 schools who plan to take part, plus students and parents.\nThey plan to hold a rally in front of Oakland Technical High School from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. and then march to the Oakland Unified School District office, where they plan to rally into the afternoon.\nIn a letter to staff sent this week, district officials reminded teachers the action is illegal, writing: \"Teachers participating in sick-outs will be subject to disciplinary action and will lose pay for time missed as these coordinated actions present significant safety and instructional problems for our students.\"\nJenine Lindsey, the district\u2019s director of labor strategy, said there\u2019s a reason state law lays out a process for resolving labor disputes.\nThe district anticipates schools will stay open and instruction will continue, with central office staff filling in. Some schools may run on modified schedules.\nThis sickout, like the last, isn't sanctioned by the teachers union, the Oakland Education Association.\n\"I understand the frustrations of our teachers,\" said OEA president Keith Brown. \"Our teachers are willing to take action for the schools that Oakland students deserve.\"\nFriday's action comes after a rally last weekend that drew hundreds of teachers, parents and labor leaders to downtown Oakland to call for increased funding for education and to protest looming budget cuts and school closures.\nWith Los Angeles teachers striking, six states have now seen educators stage walkouts to protest underfunding in the last year. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that Oakland will be the next battleground in the national debate about how we fund public education and pay teachers.\nAs in L.A., Oakland's negotiations snagged on teacher pay and class size, among other things. The Oakland teachers union wants to see a 12 percent salary increase over three years, while the district\u2019s final offer is a 5 percent increase over three years.\n\"The pay is too low in Oakland, and the rent is very high,\" Brown said. \"It is important that our teachers have a living wage so they're able to stay in the community and give our students the support they deserve.\"\nThe average teacher salary in Oakland Unified is $63,149. That\u2019s lower than all other districts in Alameda County, though that figure doesn't account for benefits.\nWe want to hear from you. What stories should we cover?\nOakland Unified's Lindsey argues that OUSD teachers don't see benefits deducted from their paychecks, while teachers in some other districts do.\nThe showdown over pay and working conditions is playing out as budget cuts and school closures roil the district. Oakland Unified is faced with tens of millions of dollars in cuts over the next three years, and the bailout money available from the state hinges on the district showing that it\u2019s taking steps to become financially stable.\nFollow our coverage of the strikes, closures, and more.\nTo that end, Oakland Unified is looking to cut millions of dollars from next year\u2019s budget, while moving to close and merge schools. District officials estimate they need to cut down the district\u2019s footprint by 24 schools.\nAll this is aggravating the frustrations teachers already had about their working conditions.\nFor their part, district officials say they want to pay teachers more. The district has identified boosting teacher pay and settling the contract as priorities for improving teacher retention and ultimately improving student outcomes.\nGiven their budget constraints, it's a matter of coming up with the money. District officials say they\u2019re looking for places to cut, but have not given specifics.\nThe final step in the formal negotiation process is a fact-finding hearing set for Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. The union and district could reach an agreement during the hearing. If they don't, they expect a recommendation for a settlement from the fact-finding panel by mid-February. If the union rejects it, they can strike.\nBrown said he plans to announce the date of the strike vote this Sunday at an event to create posters and artwork for the possible walkout.",

The text of the Rule was divided into roughly 120 sections, and read in order over the course of four months, making for three full readings a year. At Citeaux, however, this reading began not on January 1st, as in most other houses, but on March 21st, which is both the feast day of St Benedict, and the day the abbey was founded in 1098. Beginning the reading of the Rule on this day became an annual reminder not only of the Order\u2019s founding, but more specifically of the Cistercians\u2019 role as the \u201cstrict constructionalists\u201d of Benedictine monasticism, almost as if to say that the observance of the Rule itself began again with the coming of the new Order.\nThe first two pages of the Rule of St Benedict, with the Prologue to be read on March 21st, from a Cistercian Martyrology printed at Paris in 1689.",

It was probably one of your old acquaintances bragging about going keto, or eating a keto lunch, or being in ketosis for 10 days.

And, when it comes to keto diet pills, that\u2019s pretty good.\nHowever, how do you know if Green Force Keto Supplement actually will help you lose weight? Well, you\u2019re probably not going to like this answer. But, you have to actually try the formula.

However, we lead such busy lives that weight loss often falls to the back burner. Is Green Force Keto Diet Supplement going to be the answer for you?\nWell, at this point in the market, most keto diet pills are very similar. The one difference is the dosage each formula delivers to your body.

Check it out now!\nAs with any keto diet pill, ingredients matter. You want something natural but strong enough to help your body. And, in this case, the Green Force Keto Weight Loss Formula uses BHB Ketones. These are believed to be somewhat similar to the ketones your body actually releases to get you into ketosis. And, those ones are linked to energy and metabolic rate in the body. So, the idea here is that they can trigger ketosis for your body.\nOf course, we\u2019re not saying the Green Force Keto Weight Loss Pills formula will turn you into a supermodel. But, since it\u2019s based on at least some biological science, we think it\u2019s worth the try today. However, we still think the #1 keto diet pill above is more worth your time.

So, it\u2019s always important to use caution and take care of yourself at all times.\nIf you try Green Force Keto Pills and experience side effects, stop taking them right away.

    "text": "Giant (n): a person or thing of unusually great size, power, importance, etc\u2026 (adj): unusually large, great or strong; gigantic; huge.\nThere are going to be giants in your life. If you aren\u2019t facing one today, you will soon. I don\u2019t say this to bring gloom and doom but to state the reality of living in a fallen world. We can live in ignorance, hoping for a rose garden with no thornes or we can be prepared to fight the battles when they come.\nThe Israelites faced many difficulties in the desert (most of which were a result of their sin and disobedience) but they also faced literal giants; men that were bigger, stronger and much taller than they. In Numbers 14 the first generation of Israelites allowed these giants to defeat them, not physically but mentally. Standing at the edge of the Promised Land they could see the size of the armies they needed to defeat and they let the appearance of these great men overpower their belief in God\u2019s promise to deliver them.\nAs a result, nearly an entire generation missed out on the blessings that God wanted so desperately to give them.\nSo what\u2019s the solution? How do we overcome the giants in our lives? The easy to say, yet complicated to accomplish answer is prayer and faith and they must be executed in this order.\nOnce we know God\u2019s plan for conquering our giant we must move forward, walking in obedience and faith.\nIn Exodus 14 we find the Israelites leaving Egypt, but with an entire Egyptian army hot on their tails. \u201cAnd Moses said to the people, \u2018Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again. The Lord will fight for you and you have only to be silent.\u201d (Exodus 14:14). A few verses later the entire Egyptian army is drowned in the Red Sea.\nYet when we go back to Numbers 14, we hear a completely different story. The spies have just returned from scoping out the Promised Land. Caleb and Joshua bring a wonderful report of delicious fruits and fertile soil, but the other men see only the giants living in the land and work to convince the people that they are too big to be defeated. We pick up the story in verse eight, listening in on Caleb and Joshua\u2019s side of the argument. \u201cIf the Lord delights in us, he will bring us into the land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey. Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread to us. Their protection is removed from them, and the Lord is with us; do not fear them.\u201d (14:8-9). But the people were not to be convinced and verse 10 says \u201cThen all the congregation said to stone [Joshua & Caleb] with stones.\u201d Even though the Israelites knew God\u2019s plan was to take them into an abundant, life giving land, they refused to take that last step of faith and believe that God would again defeat their enemies (as he had done so many times in the last 40 years).\nThat being said, it\u2019s time to examine where you are in the fight against the giants.

    "text": "Starting a blog can be overwhelming so I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favorite blogging resources. I am suggesting these resources because I either use them and believe in them or know someone who does and trust their judgement. Some of these recommendations are affiliate links meaning if you click them and end up buying something or subscribing to something I will earn a commission at no added cost to you.\nI spent so much time researching different web hosts, a year really. I knew the choice would be between the top two and I ended up going with SiteGround which is usually ranked 1 or 2 on most hosting lists. In order to have a successful blog and especially if you plan to monetize it self hosting is a must. I have been very happy with my site\u2019s speed, load times and up time. They have different types of hosting, I use WordPress hosting, and different plans to choose from starting at $3.95 a month.\nYou will need to install a theme for your blog. While there are many free themes you can use you may decide to upgrade to a paid theme. Themes can run anywhere from $0 \u2013 $1000 but most are usually between $15 \u2013 $80. Even though I love a bargain sometimes it pays to spend a little more to get a better product and many times paid themes come with added benefits. I use the Lucy & Lane theme from Angie Makes.

    "text": "\"Oh, you are stuck on homework problem number 13? I found a solution on YouTube. That helped a lot. Just Google it, you can find all the solutions.\"\nThe second problem is partially my fault. When I give an in-class assessment, I leave the solution out on the front desk so that students can check their answers when they are finished. Instead of studying this and figuring out their mistakes, students will usually just take a quick picture of the solutions using their phone. Of course they ask if it's OK to take a snapshot first, and I let them. However, the problem is that they think of the solution as something to collect rather than something to learn from.\nConfusion is the sweat of learning.\nYou can't just google a physics solution and expect to learn. Imagine if Luke Skywalker had access to the Internet on Dagobah. Here's what would have happened when his x-wing sunk beneath the water.\nYoda: So certain are you? Always with you what cannot be done. Do you nothing that I say?\nLuke: Master moving stones around is one thing, but this is entirely different. But let me just Google \"how to lift an x-wing with the Force.\" Ah. Here it is.\nOf course that's not what happened (I would make this alternate scene into a comic if I could actually draw). Luke learned about the Force by failing. Yes, students learn physics by working on problems and by failing to solve problems. It's the journey to the solution that's important, not the solution itself. Using a video solution would be like using a golf cart to run 5 miles. Sure, you end up in the same place if you run or ride\u2014but they do not produce the same results.\nBut why do students think this? Why do they think learning is as simple as quick search or a photo with their smart phone? There are likely many reasons for students to hold these learning beliefs. However, I popular media often doesn't help. Remember this scene from The Avengers?\nSHIELD agent Maria Hill asks Tony Stark: \"When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\" Stark's answer: \"Last night\". This shows that Tony Stark is so awesome he just figured astrophysics out last night. Clearly, students feel that you have to be a special superhero to understand astrophysics. You either get it in one night, or you'll never get it. I would prefer to have Stark say \"Well, I've been working in this field for 10 years and I'm just scratching the surface.\" Maybe that wouldn't fit too well in the movie.\nOr here's another good one from Days of Thunder.\nCole pulls up to the race track to test out a stock car.\nSee. Learning is simple. You just need to watch some videos and you'll be all set\u2014except when you aren't. Nope. Learning is tough, but it's totally worth it.",

The total annual cost of losses to poker machines annually was $12 billion, Wilkie said.\nCommenting on the form the pre-commitment technology would take the MP said again re-affirmed no biometrics would be used. Instead, existing loyalty cards used by many community club members would be the most likely format.\nWilkie estimated that the cost of problem gambling on poker machines is some $1.64 billion and that there are 95,000 Australians \u2018problem gamblers\u2019 and 95,000 Australia gamblers at risk of becoming problem gamblers. He estimated that each of these gamblers affects in some way between five and 10 other Australians.",

    "text": "These two healthcare REITs are trading for dirt-cheap valuations despite high dividends and a solid history of growth.\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, is one of the best ways to enjoy high dividends and the potential for capital growth. On a valuation basis, REITs specializing in healthcare properties are trading cheaply right now, and two seem to be a particularly good bargain: HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW).\nThis type of real estate should be an excellent long-term investment for three main reasons: demographics, increased healthcare spending, and market opportunity.\nDemographics indicate a growing demand for healthcare properties over the coming decades. Simply put, the population is getting older -- fast. The 65-and-up population in the U.S. is expected to nearly double by 2050 as baby boomers age and live longer. Older individuals require more healthcare, therefore the number of healthcare facilities will grow to meet the demand.\nFurthermore, healthcare costs are rising at a faster rate than other expenditures, as you can see in the chart below. Given that commercial properties derive most of their value from their ability to generate rental income, healthcare properties should appreciate faster than other property types as long as this trend continues.\nFinally, the healthcare real estate market is about $1 trillion in size, and no REIT has more than a 3% market share. The industry is highly fragmented, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for new investments from existing properties, in addition to the opportunities that will come from future growth of the industry.\nHCP is one of the \"big three\" healthcare REITs, and it owns 1,179 properties in a variety of categories -- mainly senior housing, post-acute care, life science, and medical office buildings. Essentially, the business model is to acquire attractive properties and team up with some of the best operating partners in the business, such as Brookdale Senior Living.\nThe company pays a notable 7.1% dividend yield and has an even more impressive record of dividend growth. In fact, HCP has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nHCP's biggest recent news item is the planned spinoff of its HCR ManorCare assets, which include virtually all of the post-acute/skilled-nursing properties in the company's portfolio. You can have an in-depth look at the spinoff, but the general goal is to allow HCP to focus on its private-pay senior housing, life science, and medical office properties, thereby improving portfolio quality and giving the company more financial flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. The spun-off assets, meanwhile, will be placed in a newly created REIT that will strive to maximize their value.\nAccording to HCP, once this happens, the company can employ several new strategies with these properties, including some that are not possible or practical while the assets are still a part of HCP.\nData source: HCP company presentation.\nMedical Properties Trust focuses on hospital properties, which, according to the company, produce better initial yields than other types of healthcare real estate. In fact, the company is the fourth-largest owner of for-profit hospital beds in the country.\nData source: Medical Properties Trust.\nThe company has 204 properties located in 29 states and four foreign countries, and the long-term plan calls for even further international diversification. This way, if one market faces headwinds (say, the U.S.), it won't represent virtually all of Medical Properties' assets.\nThe company does have a relatively high debt load for a REIT: Debt represents 51.6% of Medical Properties' assets, so there's added risk to consider. However, 98% of the portfolio's leases have annual rent increases built in, and the company's payout ratio is less than two-thirds of FFO -- lower than that of most peers.\nIn short, there's no reason to believe Medical Properties Trust will have any debt-related issues going forward, with a growing stream of income that's already more than enough to cover the dividend.\nNote: Share prices and guidance are current as of 5/23/16. Normalized or adjusted FFO guidance is used when available.\nNo stock with double-digit growth potential is without risk, and these two are certainly no exception. In fact, a higher level of perceived risk is responsible for the low valuations. Healthcare spending could slow, operating partners could face greater financial difficulties, or there could be a shortage of attractive acquisition opportunities in the target property types. Any one of these factors could cause these stocks to take a dive.\nHowever, I think the growth potential and the solid track record of delivering profits in a variety of economic climates more than make up for the risks. Either of these healthcare REITs would make a solid addition to a well-diversified dividend growth portfolio.",

Or these nobles of Ammon may have turned against David in hopes of provoking him and gaining a victory over Israel.\nWhatever the reason, David\u2019s men were humiliated by their Ammonite hosts with no provocation. Then the Ammonites raised an army of 33,000 mercenaries from neighboring Aramean states \u2014 another act of unprovoked aggression against Israel. David\u2019s army scored a resounding victory under the leadership of Joab and his brother Abishai. But the Arameans apparently did not learn their lesson, because they regrouped, sent for reinforcements, and came at Israel again! This time David himself led the armies of God to victory \u2014 the last recorded triumph of Israel\u2019s warrior-king before his affair with Bathsheba.\nWhat does the humiliation of David\u2019s messengers suggest about the Ammonites\u2019 motives?\nWhat do Amos 1:13 and Zephaniah 2:8\u201311 tell us about the history of the Ammonites\u2019 relationship with Israel?\nWhy do you think God gave Joab such a great victory, despite the fact that Joab had committed treachery and murder?\nWhy did David himself lead the final battle against the Arameans?\nAnyone whose well-intentioned motives have been misconstrued \u2014 whether accidentally or purposely \u2014 can identify with the envoys of David in this story. Since all of us have felt the pain of this rejection, let us resolve to be extremely careful in judging the motives of others!",

Launched 10 years ago, and in hibernation for the last three, the time for action has come at last.The European Space Agency\\\u2019s Rosetta probe aims for a spectacular first in space exploration. The billion-euro machine will catch up with a comet, circle it slowly, and throw down a lander to the surface. With gravity too weak to keep it there, the box of electronics and sensors on legs will cling to its ride with an explosive metal harpoon.Together, the Rosetta probe and its lander, Philae, will scan and poke the comet as it tears towards the sun. As the comet draws near, it will warm and spew huge plumes of gas and dust in a tail more than one million kilometres long. The spectacle has never been captured up close before.The comet, named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, formed from cosmic debris 4.6bn years ago, before material had coalesced to form the Earth and our nearest planets, and the sun was a newborn star. Even rocket scientists find the comet\\\u2019s name hard work. Some opt instead for \\\u201dChury\\\u201d.By studying the comet \u2013 some of the most pristine and primordial material there is \u2013 scientists hope to learn more about the origins of the solar system. The presence of ice, and traces of organics, might hint at answers to other big questions: how Earth got its water and how life began. But first the spacecraft must wake up.Rosetta was put into hibernation in June 2011 when its trajectory took it so far from the sun \u2013 beyond the orbit of Jupiter \u2013 that light reaching its solar panels was too feeble to provide power. Mission scientists deliberately built in the dormant stage of its voyage, but the silence is still nerve-wracking. No one has heard from the spacecraft since.\nvia Rosetta comet chaser set to wake up on Monday after three years\u2019 sleep | Science | The Guardian.",

    "text": "Of Course BPA Can Be Found Inside You!\nIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket-scientist to understand how toxins from plastics can be found in the umbilical cord of our newborn babies, in our blood and in our tissues. Generations of exposure to those toxins that can be found in EVERY plastic bottle is always leached into your water, and it always finds it\u2019s way into the body. When N.I.H (National Institute of Health, the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research) labels our children as being \u201cPRE-POLLUTED\u201d then you KNOW we have bigger problems than most people want to acknowledge at all.\nThe average temperature of water that is processed through reverse osmosis is 190\u00b0. This means that the source water has already reached temperatures that cause the chemicals to leach out from the plastic BEFORE you buy and refrigerate it! In other words, the dangers of consuming fluids from a plastic bottle begin at the bottling plant and there\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent exposure to these chemicals whatsoever.\nIt takes approximately 5 liters of water to produce (and fill) a 1 liter bottle of water using the reverse osmosis process. If you understand the volatility of our natural resources, this should be of great concern to you!\nThe reverse osmosis process doesn\u2019t discriminate \u2013 is very good at removing the bad things (at least before it hits the bottle, that is) but it removes all of the natural minerals right along with the bad things. Water without minerals has absolutely NO BENEFIT to the human body whatsoever. This is true for distilled water too!\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the plastic is made with BPA or if it\u2019s BPA-free.\nThere is NO such thing as safe plastic\u2026not for you and your family, and not for the environment. Just say \u201cNO\u201d to all plastics\u2026especially those used for your water consumption!\nIf you decide to take a positive step in the right direction by making the decision to do away with all those harmful plastics impacting YOUR health (and the health of the future generations) reach out to me. There is a better, healthier way and it doesn\u2019t involve a toxic water bottle filled with clear fluids. Your body will thank you for it, the future generations will thank you for it AND the environmental will thank you for it too.\nI\u2019m an environmental advocate specializing in water. A mini \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d \u2026instead of fighting for justice, I have solutions for businesses and families. Families like the Donald Trump family, the Bill Gates family, the Seattle Seahawks families, the NY Yankees families and familes like yours and mine. If you\u2019d like more information about the solutions that I have to offer, reach out to me.\nLynn Gardner, lynn@liquid-assets-usa.com or call 202 241 1542.\nWith bottled water out-selling carbonated drinks for the first time, there is no limit to the options being made available to consumers by money-hungry providers and most of it is NOT what it claims to be! Bottled water dominates more square footage in the grocery story than any other product! More and more \u201calkaline\u201d waters and more and more\u201dhydrogen infused\u201d options are hitting the shelves and the $30.00 per gallon price tag doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing anybody down! Wise consumers are looking at affordable, long-term options so that they can have an endless supply of alkalized water in their own home and these wise consumers are looking to consumer ionization appliances as a result. These wise consumers also understand that by purchasing a long-term solution; they save thousands and thousands of dollars over the long run.\nLongevity. Because consumers are rapidly catching on to the benefits of drinking cleaner, healthier water and more alkaline water and the ionizer industry is beginning to boom as a result. Unfortunately, there are many start-up and 3rd party ionizer companies chasing the market, promising the moon and selling the truth short online. Look for a company that has been in the market long enough to be established AND long enough to have proven to stand behind their product and their warranties, one that offers reliable and reasonable service inside of the U.S. and one that can speak with experience about the life-cycle expectations of your unit. a quality ionizer SHOULD last for 20+ years with simple, routine maintenance. Look for a company that has the stay-power to be there for you long after your investment and one that already has a track record to \u201cprove\u201d how long your investment should last!\nReputable. There are good things and not-so-good things about the Internet. One of the not-so-good things is that it\u2019s easy to \u201clook good on paper\u201d. Dealing with strangers on the Internet over ANY investment but particularly a sizable investment is never a good idea. Many of the 3rd party ionizer companies that you see online have already undergone name changes a few times and some have the worst Better Business Bureau ratings possible; that\u2019s saying a whole lot when so many of them have been in business for just a few years. It\u2019s not a good sign OR a good investment to put your money with a company that has already proven to be a problem for other consumers. Look for a company that has been around the block a few times and one that you can go directly to for any concerns or problems that you have.\nUSA Focused. Most (if not all) ionizers are manufactured outside of the US. The majority of the units that you see on the market today are manufactured by the same Korean manufacturer under different labels. The company that you may buy from is likely a 3rd party representative and not the manufacturer at all and in that case, they don\u2019t manufacture, service or warranty the units at a;;. When services is needed, your unit must be shipped back to the original manufacturer in Korea, and at your expense. Look for a USA focused ionizer company that will actually stand behind and service your investment here in the United States. In other words, look for a direct manufacturer and NOT a 3rd party sales entity.\nSight Unseen. If you\u2019re going to make the investment in ionization technology for you and your family, it\u2019s not a good idea purchase sight unseen. You should have the chance to see it (and try it) for yourself before you buy. Although one company may give you the opportunity to see and try for yourself most of them don\u2019t. Each ionizer on the market is vastly different from another and it\u2019s not reasonable for you to expect that what you find online is like what you\u2019ve already seen and tried for yourself! Consumers don\u2019t buy vehicles that way\u2026\u201dtest driving\u201d one brand and then buying a completely different vehicle without ever seeing or driving it first. That is a risky approach no matter how large or how small the price tag is and it makes no financial sense whatsoever. Look for a company that will allow you to see (and try) the product for yourself before you buy!\nWarranty: There are warranties and then there are warranties, and it\u2019s important to select a company that will not only stand behind the warranty, but also one that will be able to honor it within the U.S. Wise consumers recognize that there is no such thing as a lifetime, unlimited warranty without a \u201ccatch\u201d of some kind. Late-night infomercials often use this strategy to entice sales, but they generally have low-cost items and studies have proven that 98.9% of consumers will not bother to ship back a low-ticket item even with that \u201cmoney back guarantee\u201d. If necessary, ask to see the full warranty before you purchase (versus a warranty certificate) and don\u2019t just \u201cbuy in\u201d to a company that says they\u2019ll stand behind the product \u201cforever\u201dand ever no matter what. Every \u201clifetime\u201d warranty on the planet has exclusions of some sort and \u201clifetime\u201d warranty ionizer companies are no different. If they go out of business; you have no warranty and if you\u2019re required to ship your product back to Korea to the manufacturer (avg shipping $600 each way), it makes no financial sense whatsoever. Look for a company that has a solid (and realistic) warranty along with U.S. service centers prepared to offer timely and efficient serving whenever it\u2019s needed.\nInvesting in ionization water technology is (by far) the single most significant investment that you can make for your health and well-being and it makes perfect financial sense for the long run\u2026if you buy the right one, that is! When it comes to anything consumable, it pays to do your homework AND it never pays to skimp.\nIf you\u2019d like more information on ionization technology, reach out to me.\nExperts Blame Dehydration for Stroke Damage? It\u2019s About Time!\nHeadlines in a an article published by Everyday Health reads \u2013 \u201cDehydration Leads to Greater Stroke Damage\u201d. More accurately it should read \u201cDehydration Leads to Greater Stroke Risk\u201c. Dehydration is your enemy and it\u2019s time to give it the blame that it deserves. The human brain is 85% water and the blood is 90% water. When the body is deprived of water, the consequences go well beyond what most people understand. We\u2019ve replaced the body\u2019s NEED for water with a beverage-of-choice and we no longer recognize the signs of dehydration.\nDr. Paul Bendheim, a clinical professor of neurology from the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson, says \u201cthere are no hard-and-fast rules for staying well-hydrated, despite recommendations to drink eight glasses of water each day\u201c. That\u2019s a no-brainer! Obviously the amount of water each individual needs depends on a number of factors; activity, weight and status of health just to name a few. Dr. Bendheim goes on to say, \u201cprior research found that the majority of people are dehydrated when they have a stroke, but it\u2019s not clear why\u201d. How in the world can it not be clear why people are dehydrated? It\u2019s interesting to note that most heart attacks and strokes happen in the middle of the night when the body is the most dehydrated. It\u2019s a very good thing to drink water before you retire for the night!\nThe 8 Glasses of Water a Day Rule is just THE MINIMUM needed to keep your organs functioning\u2026but it sure isn\u2019t enough to keep your blood hydrated and your veins free and clear!\nIf you\u2019re active, if you\u2019re sick or if you\u2019re overweight, you need a whole lot more than just eight, 8-ounce glasses of water a day to equip the body to battle things like stroke or high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, and a multitude of other conditions! Water is positively key to your prevention and recovery\u2026you were wired that way!\nSeniors are generally more dehydrated than younger people primarily because we lose our sense of thirst as we age. We may need to be reminded to drink instead of waiting for the brain to trigger thirst. Lots of people set alarms to be reminded to take medications, perhaps it\u2019s time to set up a reliable reminder to prompt you to drink water too. Relying on your sense of thirst won\u2019t do the trick. By the time the average person \u201cfeels\u201d thirsty, they are already chronically dehydrated and ready for disaster.\nNow that you know that stroke (among LOTS OF OTHER THINGS) can be triggered or worsened by dehydration, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to do something about it?\nHow much research do you need to read before you take action to properly hydrate your body with W A T E R? It all comes down to basic biology. No amount of consuming any other fluids can replace the body\u2019s need for water. In fact, most choice beverages actually cause the body to work harder just to rid itself of toxins introduced by replacing water with another beverage.\nIf water is so important, don\u2019t you think the kind of water you drink might be important too? Of course it is! It doesn\u2019t make much sense to consume water that has no minerals whatsoever (causes the body to deplete itself of minerals from within which leads to degeneration) and it doesn\u2019t make much sense to drink water that is laced with the chemicals necessary to make human waste potable. After you make the decision to consume the amount of water your body needs; you\u2019ll need to decide what kind of SAFE and HEALTHY water you\u2019ll be introducing to your body. There aren\u2019t a whole lot of options when you look at it that way! Electrolyzed Reduced Water (ERW) is the ONLY way to go for me and my family. After doing our own research; the choice was easy for us. How much research (and testimonials) do you need to see before you embrace Electrolyzed Reduced Water as being the most beneficial water for the human body?\nI know that my days are numbered but I don\u2019t buy in to the idea that I\u2019m supposed to rot prior to my death, so I\u2019m giving my body what it needs to avoid things like stroke, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, etc., instead of looking for a pill to fix my problem later. After all, there is no cure for any disease whatsoever. With that in mind, it\u2019s time to FIGHT FOR HEALTH!\nDo yourself, your brain (and the rest of your body) and your family a favor. HYDRATE NOW!\nYour Bones Are ALIVE And They Need Your Attention!\nMost of us take our bones for granted unless we\u2019re faced with a crisis like a broken bone or a fractured hip. Our bones are very much alive and they need our attention if we want them to \u201cstand up\u201d to the job that we ask them to do day-after-day and year-after-year.\nMore than 250,000 people over the age of 65 break a hip each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s interesting to note that most of the time people don\u2019t fall a break a hip\u2026they break a hip and fall. How\u2019s that for brittle bones? Demographic reports suggest that 10,000 people a day are turning 65 and that this will continue for the next 17 years! It looks like we have a lot of bone problems on the horizon if we don\u2019t take action to protect them!\nContrary to popular belief, men are at risk too. About 1 in 5 men will break a bone due to osteoporosis. In fact, men claim 1 out of every 3 broken hips worldwide. Sadly, both health and quality of life can plummet after a hip fracture. It\u2019s alarming to note that 37% of men die within a year after they break a hip \u2014 twice as many as women, found a 2014 study published by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. This speaks volumes to the poor condition of the overall health of those battling brittle bones. It\u2019s time to give your bones (and all of the rest of you) the attention they deserve!\nAre You \u201cBad to the Bone\u201d?\nOur bones consist of 25% water. If you aren\u2019t efficiently hydrating your body, your bones (and the rest of you) will pay the ultimate price. This is just one of the reasons that the elderly often have hip and knee problems. We lose our sense of thirst as we age and if we don\u2019t make a conscious effort to drink lots of healthy water (naturally laced with minerals), we will be living in a state of chronic dehydration and the bones will begin to break down\u2026and that\u2019s just the beginning!\nRed blood cells don\u2019t last long in the bloodstream so they need to be replaced continuously by new cells, which originate in your bone marrow. This area in the center of the bone is a spongy tissue that churns out billions of new, mature blood cells each day (wow!) just to keep us supplied with the oxygen and energy we need. If we refuse to give the body the amount of (and the quality of) water it needs, this entire system begins to fail. Drinking plenty of healthy water is a very small price to pay to sustain health.\nHow Are You Neglecting Your Bones?\n1. You overlook calcium. Adults need about 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day to keep the bones in good shape. A huge source of calcium is healthy, mineral-laced water. Unfortunately most people are replacing healthy water with useless bottled water (all minerals have been removed). So in addition to not consuming enough healthy water to stay hydrated, you\u2019re robbing minerals from your bones to make up for the minerals that are not in your drinking water. Does that make sense to you? I sure hope not! Change you water\u2026change your life!\nCalcium is just part of the equation though. In addition to calcium, daily magnesium, protein, and vitamin D are essential. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption by as much as 50 percent Since we avoid the sun like the plague these days, it\u2019s important for many of us to supplement with a daily dose of Vitamin D.\n2. Digestive conditions increase your risk of having weak bones. These include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, and anorexia nervosa (according to the National Institute of Health Osteoporosis Resource Center ). It is important to note that the leading colon specialist in the world, Dr. Hiromi Shinya, recommends proper hydration with Kangen Water\u00ae for colon health. He has examined the colon of thousands of patients before and after a Kangen Water\u00ae protocol and the results are astounding. If you suffer with digestive issues, you need to write your own prescription for Kangen Water\u00ae.\nHow Are You Damaging Your Bones?\n1. Treating your GERD/acid reflux with meds. Bone loss can result from the use of antacids that contain aluminum, which can deplete your calcium supply; this includes products like Alamag, Maalox, or Mylanta. Even the commonly used drugs that treat heartburn \u2014 Prilosec, Nexim, and Prevacid \u2014 may lead to bone loss, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Alkalize the body and say \u201cgood bye\u201d to these digestive issues instead of opting for meds that may be destroying your bones!\n2. Taking steroid medications like Cortisone, Prednisone, or Desxamethasone can cause debilitating bone loss over time, notes the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF). You may have taken steroid meds \u2014 also called glucocorticoids or corticosteroids \u2014 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, asthma or allergies, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease or cancer. The root cause of these conditions is inflammation and chronic dehydration. Drink ionized, alkalized, electrically charged water and you\u2019ll likely be able to nix the steroids as your body begins to mend itself. EXPERIENCE IT 100% RISK FREE FOR 30 DAYS AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.\n3. Phenobarbital is often used to treat seizures as well as anxiety and insomnia. How many people do you know that \u201cneed a little something\u201d to help them sleep or to manage stress? The drug is sometimes habit-forming and often misused. Dilantin, another anti-seizure medication, is also linked to bone loss.\n4. Moderating your alcohol intake is important for bone health. Too much alcohol keeps you from getting the nutrients strong bones need. Abusing alcohol leads to bone weakness and a greater risk of breaking bones. If you consume alcohol remember; less is always best.\nSo you see, your bones are very much ALIVE and badly in need of your attention.\nAre you going to give them the attention they deserve or will you hold out for surgery and pain killers? Just askin\u2019.\nIf you decide that it\u2019s time to take control of your own health, reach out to me! I\u2019ve got a solution that may even outlive you and it\u2019s a game-changer when it comes to your health!\nWANT TO SEE WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT WATER?\nI Believe from Kangen Pro Tools on Vimeo.\nI Lied About Alkaline Water!\nIt is said that \u201cthe truth will set you free\u201d so here goes\u2026I lied about alkaline water. I have been busy preaching the benefits of alkaline water without understanding that long-term use of alkaline water can be detrimental to your health! It is vitally important to good health that we keep the body in an alkaline state, however the method that we use to accomplish this can \u201cmake or break\u201d us. An alkaline diet is a great start but it\u2019s just not enough to maintain the balance needed. Water is a crucial component.\nThere is a HUGE difference between alkaline water and alkalized water. How can you tell the difference? That\u2019s easy! Alkaline water is enhanced with minerals and it can be tested with a standard pool-type pH strip because pH strips react to a chemical change. Alkalized water will not change the color of a pH strip because there are NO added minerals or chemicals used in the process. Alkalized is produced by the introduction of electricity and therefore it must be tested using pH drops.\nAlkalized water is water that has been modified with the use of very high voltage electricity. If the electrical influence is strong enough. it will create was is referred to as \u201cdissociation of water\u201d.\nDr. Michael Donaldson (below) has become an expert on the impact of alkalized water on the human body and he explains the differences between alkaline and alkalized water much better than I can. I encourage you to preview this brief explanation. This is key to your health!\nThe bad news is that I offered an \u201cuneducated\u201d version of the need for alkaline water. The good news is that the source that I\u2019ve been recommending all along produces ALKALIZED water NOT alkaline water. Just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any better\u2026.\nCLICK HERE FOR ALKALIZED WATER!\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how food suppliers could possibly get by with deceiving the public about what we\u2019re really eating just look in the mirror! We are their secret weapon.\nSince water is the #1 requirement for health (and life) it\u2019s important to understand what you are (and are not) drinking too! Don\u2019t let your willful ignorance get in the way of making wise decisions about the water you and your family drink!\nThe Water Quality Association has awarded Kangen Water\u00ae the Gold Seal for water quality (aka healthy water) year after year.\nWith over 30 million people across the globe already drinking Kangen Water\u00ae isn\u2019t it time you got on board too?\nCLICK HERE for water endorsed by the WQA!\nToo Cheap to Protect Your Health? You\u2019ll Be Sorry!\nSome things in life are clearly superior to others of like kind. Here is one of my favorites.\nStradivarius violins\u2026there are none in the world like the violins mastered by the Stradivari family in the late 1600\u2019s. These instruments are famous for the quality of sound they produce. Many attribute the difference to the wood used, the region the wood came from, the environmental conditions during the growth period of the wood and the minerals used to \u201cfinish\u201d the wood. An original Stradivarius violin is not like any other in the world and it is deserving of the praise it receives.\nI remember taking a tour of a temperature controlled private facility that houses only the finest things in the world. This facility has armed guards 24/7 and every security measure known to mankind to protect the magnificent items stored there. In one room was an original Stradivarius violin. It was the only thing in this room and it had its own guard. Carefully stored in a temperature and humidity controlled glass case this violin was gently removed from its case twice a day and played by a master violinist just to be sure that it was being cared for in the way it was intended to be and that it is maintained to \u201cperfection\u201d at all times. It was a magnificent sight to see. It\u2019s worth? Millions.\nWhat\u2019s my point? My point is that your health is worth far more than the finest Stradivarius and yet we skimp, we cut corners, we ignore the obvious and then freak out when the body \u201ccries wolf\u201d and it quits working. Frankly, some people are just too cheap to protect their own health. They prefer to spend their money on indulgence instead of maintenance. Rest assured, that precious Stradivarius would not be so special if it was not provided the finest \u201ccare\u201dat all costs 24 four hours a day. Your body is no different. To maintain \u201cperfection\u201d you can\u2019t continue to ignore what it needs.\nWe are what we breathe, what we eat and what we drink. Quality is worth every penny you pay for it and THEN some. Do whatever you have to do and sacrifice whatever you have to sacrifice to buy non-GMO and organic foods. Take the highest quality supplements you can get your hands on AND last, but certainly not least, hydrate your body with the absolute healthiest water you can find. None of these things are cheap but you definitely get what you pay for when it comes to quality products for your health. I think you\u2019re worth it! Do you?\nCLICK HERE for the healthiest water you can get your hands on!",

Beyond the opportunity to network and refresh our excitement about Rails, we've been perusing the schedule and found some things that piqued our interest!\nWe know that the next version of Rails is coming up and RailsConf is a great place to learn about, and get a sneak peek at, some of the new features.\nWhile there will probably be discussion in general about the next version and DHH will probably talk about it in his keynote, we're interested to hear more about how attributes and type casting will be changing as well as how callbacks will be changing.\nWe always look forward to hearing about the progression and evolution of the framework we love!\nWhile it's not the most glamourous topic, process is an important part of software development. As Velocity Labs has begun growing, we've been evaluating and refining how we work.\nRecently, we've defined some of our processes, including a branching strategy, built-in code review cycle, continuous integration testing, issue tracking and release deployment process.\nIn particular, the code review cycle is now an integral part of how we work, but we know that there's always room for improvement. That's why we're intrigued to learn how we can improve and implement a stronger code review culture, from Derek Prior of thoughtbot.\nThere's also a session on using ECMAScript 6, in your Rails app, which sounds very interesting.\nAnd then, if you're tired of the JS framework hype, you can get a side-by-side comparison of AngularJS, Ember.js and Rails server-side JS to find out why your front-end framework is overkill.\nIf you're in Atlanta, hit us up during the conference or on Twitter @velocitylabs!\nStartup junkie, Rubyist and gamer. Loves to brainstorm about new ideas.\nNeed help with your project?\nNight Sky image courtesy of Scott Wylie under CC by 2.0, some rights reserved.",

There are 21 loft options from 46 to 64 and five sole grinds in three finishes\u2014tour chrome, black nickel and oil can.\nWhile emphasizing a dynamic new theory about scoring clubs, SCOR Golf offers seven bac kweighing designs staggered thru the 21 degrees of options (41-61). The soles feature a higher bounce angle near the leading edge and lower bounce on the rest of the sole.\nThe Cleveland S88 Forged is a remake of the cast version with milled microgrooves and a shaft with a less active tip for more penetrating ball flight. There are 19 loft/bounce option in chrome and satin.\nThe Ping Anser features a reinforced back cavity that thickens the face to minimize fluctuation and enhance control and tungsten in the toe to keep CG in its proper position. It\u2019s available with satin nickel chrome finish in six loft/bounce options from 60 to 60 degrees.\nThe Nike VR Pro Forged features a higher concentration of deeper grooves and a cross-hatch pattern the grooves to improve surface roughness. Three new lofts among 10 options from 48 to 62 degrees feature a dual sole design intended to keep the leading edge closer to the ground even with an open face. It is available in three finishes\u2014platinum, chorme and oxide.\nThe Callaway Forged has21 tightly spaced grooves with sharper edge radii thanks to going to forging. It has straighter leading edge and a more gradual C-shape sole grind. Six loft/bounce options from 52 to 64 degrees and copper and trivalent dark chriome finishes offered.\nThe Mizuno MP-R12 featurea more rounded head and grooves that are narrower on the lower lofts for full shot spin and grooves that are wider on the higher lofts for partial shot spin. It is available in nine loft/bounce options with white stain and black nickel finishes.\nThe Bridgestone J40 features a milled face for increased surface roughness to produce more spin. A recessed section near the grip of the shaft is intended to produce a sharper angle of attack. It is available in five loft/bounce options from 62 to 60 degrees in satin chrome or black oxide finishes.\nThe Cobra Trusty Rusty offers a retro look in its unplated, easier to rust, model and features a higher bounce angle in the center of the sole and relief areas in the heel and toe to keep the leading edge lower. Seven loft/bounce p[tions from 49 to 61 offered with two other finishes, black PVD and satin.\nThe TaylorMade ATV has a wider sole with a center channel designed to allow the leading edge to stay closer to the ground. The face has sharper edged grooves and uniform microtexture between them to maximize spin. It\u2019s available only in satin finish with seven loft/bounce options from 50 to 64 degrees.",

But what happens if the car you are driving suffers an unexpected tire failure at highway speeds, an animal runs out in front of your over confident child when they have had their license for just 3 weeks, or you hit a patch of spilled diesel, mud or ice on the road?\nThe advanced driver training with Harper Sports Cars offers real value by teaching you how to drive your car on the limit, when it\u2019s sliding around and barely in control. Very few people ever are able to experience their vehicles in this situation, so when they encounter an emergency situation, they are not ready for what happens next and often freeze up or use exaggerated inputs to deal with the situation. ABS is great, but it can\u2019t save you in every situation.\nWe start all our courses on gravel roads, in cars we provide and on routes that test your ability to remain in control of the vehicle while trying to cover the route as quickly as possible. It\u2019s educational and great fun. It\u2019s essential for newly licensed drivers, great as team building or as a fabulous gift. Should you wish to go big, we will set you up with a qualified instructor at a local race Track, taking you to the next level- flat out on dry tarmac.\nPlease book your driver training experience with us now! Singles and groups welcome. Pure education blended with a fun competitive approach guaranteed.",

The LDA provided language changes which provided patient input and transparency. The bill was brought before the Subcommittee, but an amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered and passed out instead\u2014a substitute that was dangerous for patients.\nThe LDA led a nationwide campaign to bring back patient friendly language and had a letter signed by 154 groups nationwide stating what was necessary from a patient perspective which was sent to all of the Members of the Energy & Commerce Committee. We then worked with Mr. Gibson and the Committee to change the language to produce a bill which will help provide a research agenda for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases including evaluating chronic or persistent infection and co-infections.\nThe LDA thanks Mr. Gibson, bill sponsor; Mr. C. Smith; and Mr. Upton and all of the Committee members who supported the bill. We also thank our partner groups who were instrumental in the effort to pass this legislation, and all Lyme groups across the country, patients, and other groups who worked on this effort. The next step for the bill is to go to the House floor, which will probably occur sometime after the summer Congressional recess.\nDay 2 video (7/30), bill voting, is in the second video box, begins at 33:20.",

    "text": "Anna C. Christensen has been a supporter of family planning since high school, when she stuffed envelopes as a volunteer at a Planned Parenthood affiliate in California. Now a Tucson resident, she continues to advocate for reproductive rights and sexual health.\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona serves more than 100,000 families every year; maybe your family is one of them.\nTucson is home to the Margaret Sanger Health Center, namesake of Planned Parenthood's founder. A century ago, Margaret Sanger was a New York City nurse who witnessed the horrors of women dying prematurely after having too many children, while others died from botched abortions. This experience motivated her to become an activist for the availability and legality of contraception. Sanger was a controversial figure\u2014and that controversy lingers to this day.\nSanger first visited Tucson in the 1930s, when she helped set up the Tucson Mother's Health Clinic (also called Clinica Para las Madres), Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona's precursor. Sanger, bedeviled by health problems, was drawn by Tucson's climate. Her husband was drawn by Arizona's lack of income tax, and in 1933, they purchased an adobe house in the foothills.\nIn the early '40s, Sanger and her husband moved closer to the city's heart, as gasoline rations dulled suburbia's attractiveness. They moved into a house on Elm Street, just east of the Arizona Inn. Before his death, her husband obtained an empty lot on Sierra Vista Drive, a stone's throw from their Elm Street residence. Sanger's son Stuart built a house on one side, and Sanger decided to build her dream home on the other.\nSanger's homes hosted lavish parties as well as fundraisers for organizations like Planned Parenthood of Southern Arizona and the Tucson Medical Center (of which she was also a co-founder). She took up hobbies such as cooking and watercolor; today, many of her original paintings adorn the walls of Planned Parenthood administrative headquarters in Tucson, the building that was named in her honor.\nPlanned Parenthood, in Arizona and nationwide, is currently under attack. Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to do away with Title X, a national program providing preventive health care to low-income patients; the fate of Title X is now in the Senate's hands. Since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed it into law, it has helped millions of women access services such as contraception, preventing an estimated 973,000 unintended pregnancies and 406,000 abortions every year.\nRep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), meanwhile, seeks to interfere with services covered by private insurance. By cutting off federal funds for insurance companies that cover abortions\u2014even when the tax dollars aren't put toward abortion coverage\u2014his bill would deny women the legal right to an abortion, guaranteed by the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. It would also impose tax penalties on those whose insurance offers such coverage.\nIn Arizona, families are facing further potential threats as the Republican-controlled Legislature introduced several anti-women's-health initiatives this year. HB 2384 would make Planned Parenthood newly ineligible for the Arizona Working Poor Tax Credit. HB 2416 would cause additional obstacles to abortion access, including changing the definition of \"surgical abortion\" to include abortion by pill, which could cut off rural women from abortion services. HB 2443 would infringe upon patient privacy by denying care to women who refuse to disclose the reasons behind their decision to abort.\nA century ago, Margaret Sanger witnessed tragedies that resulted from unintended pregnancies. In response, she illegally smuggled diaphragms into the country and opened family-planning clinics in defiance of the law\u2014and spent time in jail for her troubles. This is the world Sanger and other birth-control activists came from, and it's the world lawmakers are trying to bring back.\nDon't stand for it. Talk to your friends; write to your representatives; vote; volunteer; and visit www.standwithplannedparenthood.org to show your support for Planned Parenthood's crucial work.",

So far we have a 100% success record, but if we can\u2019t then our service doesn\u2019t cost you a penny.\nHow much work is involved for me in the change-over?\nVery little. We copy any invoices, ascertain the status of existing contracts and suggest cost savings. If we suggest a change of supplier we fill in the account application forms and get your account pre-cleared where possible. We then provide a full report which enables you to see all the necessary figures and make a decision.\nWhat if I\u2019m in contract with a supplier?\nWe ensure that you serve notice in a timely manner and diarise when the contract terminates so that we can review the costs ahead of that time.\nWe are happy with our existing suppliers.\nWe are not about changing suppliers; but we always look at removing any unnecessary overheads.\nWhen do I pay for the savings?\nIf you accept our pricing suggestions, savings are paid for quarterly in arrears. They are therefore both profit & loss and cash positive. In our Dec 2013 Client Survey 100% of respondents said we provide value for money with 85% rating us as excellent or very good in terms of the overall value for money we deliver.\nWe only want you to look at one area and it won\u2019t be worth your while.\nWe\u2019re happy to make the call on that. Give us the opportunity and let us decide.\nFrom your side it lays down the timelines for us to provide information and states that the products and/or services that we quote for will at least match those you currently enjoy. From our side it merely confirms your commitment to pay us for the work done and information provided. It therefore protects the interests of both parties.\nWhat if I\u2019m not happy with the supplier you recommend?\nYou don\u2019t have to use our suppliers. If you wish you can use our information to negotiate directly with your existing suppliers, or simply not go ahead and receive cost savings.\nWe have a lovely local supplier who we would like to support if they are competitive.\nNo problem, tell us whether or not you wish us to contact current or specific suppliers and we\u2019ll act accordingly. Be aware though of how you may react if someone acting on behalf of your biggest customer contacted you and said that the business was up for competitive tender and that you needed to sharpen your pencil or run the risk of losing the business.\nWe use best practise and only give suppliers one chance to quote. We are in regular contact with key suppliers in each of the markets in which we operate in order to maintain our price competitiveness. Our systems are constantly refined to ensure that we are aware of market prices, and your prices reflect this. We contact at least three suppliers with any requirement, and are always on the look out for new suppliers.\nWhat happens if prices change after you negotiate?\nSome markets rise and some fall \u2013 it\u2019s our business to know which are which. If they are rising markets we will protect you against price increases by suggesting that you enter into a contract, e.g. gas and electricity at present. If they are dropping markets we will not tie you in to long term contracts and will pass on all price decreases during the period of our agreement.\nHow do you collect your information?\nWe need copy invoices which we will gladly copy on your premises. In addition we will need any passwords or other access information that you have in place on accounts, typically mobile and landline \u2018phone accounts\u2019.\nWe\u2019ll have the information about how you can receive savings on your desk within 10 days of receiving the copy invoices \u2013 as long as your diary permits!! Savings can be on your bottom line within 1 month of you signing our agreement.\nOur business is unique; a \u201cstandard\u201d service will not help us.\nAll of our clients are unique. If we are unable to save you money it won\u2019t cost you anything BUT if we can save you money\u2026.\nHave you ever looked at\u2026.\nThe skills in our business are in identifying suppliers and negotiating the right outcome. We have deep knowledge in a wide variety of specific markets and, as always, if you give us the challenge and we can\u2019t save you money it won\u2019t cost you anything.",
