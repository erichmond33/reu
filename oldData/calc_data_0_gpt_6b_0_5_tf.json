Type the color(s) in 3 or 6 digit hex code format eg. #173086, #138 or RGB numbers format eg. 23, 48, 134. Backgroud color is optional. Default value FFFFFF (white) is selected when no value supplied for bg color. (Note: no matter whether the symbol # is used in hex code or not.) The online color tester also helps you to select the harmonic color combinations. The complementary, triadic, analogous, split complementary, tetradic and square color schemes in the Color combining guide recommend you the best color groups for the two, three or four color design. You can also pick up the colors from the gradient scale, best brightness (lightness) level from tints or shades scale and the best suitable vibrance level from the saturation scale. Moreover you can pick the color you like from the random color palette generator. Color tester also shows you the negative and monochrome (grayscale) representation of selected color and the closest websafe color. You also find there the RGB and CMYK representations calculation.\nDummy text written in hex #173086 color on a background color. Text in color #173086 on the desired background color will look just like this. You just see the hex #173086 colored text written on a hex #FFFFFF color backgroud... Or you can't see, if you selected the wrong combination of colors :). The background color should be selected so that the intended #173086 text color is well visible on it. Alternatively, you can choose text color different than #173086 to achieve better text readability. It can be rounded to the 3 character hex code #138. The RGB values of the #173086 hex color are R: 23, G: 48, B: 134. In percentage it is Red: 9%, Green: 18.8%, Blue: 52.5%.

No more than 12 babies at any one time create our little perfect paradise.\nHere, babies learn to sit up, roll, crawl and eventually take their first few steps. Following on from the wonderful start life they will have had at home, our staff are trained to meet each baby\u2019s individual needs and routine.\nOur Poppies (and their keyworkers) love to get messy, from paint, sand and water that is on offer all the time, to jelly play, gloop and play dough \u2013 these are just a few of the sensory opportunities we plan daily. As well as this books, construction, home corner and heuristic play make up the rest of the playroom.\nAnd when we are all tired out, there is a cosy sleep area to rest in until our batteries are re charges and we start the fun all over again!!\nJust shortly after your child\u2019s second birthday they will move to the Daisy Room, this is where the fun really begins!!\nHaving newly discovered walking, running and climbing there are lots of physical play opportunities in this room.

    "text": "Unlike many of his peers, Crane is quick to let down his hair [not literally, of course].\nYou might know Ben Crane best from his YouTube videos, in which he speeds up his pace of play by donning Rollerblades and being towed by a golf cart; raps about barely qualifying for the FedEx Cup playoffs (\"I'm a bubble boy/buh-buh-bubble boy\"); and shares his mental-game secrets, Golf in the Kingdom\u2013style (\"I experience zone. I'm speaking to you from the now, in the middle of the now.\") Crane also croons with his fellow Golf Boys bandmates Rickie Fowler, Hunter Mahan and Bubba Watson (with lyrics by Mat Kearney, the singer-songwriter who, like Crane, hails from Oregon). But the 37-year-old funnyman also has an intense side. You've heard of the 10,000 hours it takes to master a pursuit? Crane has logged 35,000 hours honing his game. (He counted.) If you think that's odd, consider that Crane believes he's no more innately talented at golf than you are. The main reason he chose this career path was because as a kid he could beat his five buddies. The Tour's biggest ham talks about the 100 percent commitment required to excel at both golf and comedy, his infamously slow pace of play, and why he won't let the bad back that knocked him out of the 2013 FedEx Cup playoffs diminish his enthusiasm -- or his sense of humor.\nIn the media center after you won the 2010 Farmers Insurance Open, you broke into an impersonation of your southern-fried, former-college-football-coach agent Tommy Limbaugh. It got quite a laugh, even among the cynical press. Was that when you realized you could bring your act to a wider audience?\nIt's been a slow progression, no pun intended, where things have just worked. The more you show your personality, the more fun everyone else has. I'm watching tennis last night, I'm watching Rafael Nadal play a guy, and it was 6-0 in the first set, and in the second set the guy is just trying to score a point. He finally thought he scored one; they did the shot-spot thing, and it was out by an inch. It was the moment where he should have gone, like, What do I gotta do to score a point against this Nadal guy? But he didn't. Athletes get so stuck in competition sometimes that we just can't let go of it.\nHas your game improved since you've been expressing this lighter side?\nWell, 2010 and 2005 were my best years, but it's been a battle with my body. I have a lot more potential now, and I have a bigger team around me. Instead of no one following me, now I'll have friends who are following me, and sometimes they'll walk up to a random person and say, \"Who are you following?\" In a few cases the person has said, \"Ben Crane. He's my favorite player.\" And my friend will go, \"Why?\" And the kid will say, \"You don't know? You don't know about the videos?\" [Laughs] That is so fun right there.\nYour fans definitely get your sense of humor. When your caddie decided to take a day off on a Wednesday, and you told people to apply on Twitter for the one-day job to replace him, you got interesting responses, like, \"I have a rough tongue like a cat and can clean the grooves of a wedge in seconds. My tics are mostly silent.\"\n[Laughs] That deserves to be written somewhere in this magazine! That is so good. We've opened up the job twice, actually. We did it at the Byron Nelson and at the Travelers. For the Nelson, we found a guy who had played in college. It was his birthday. And for the Travelers, we did it for a cause called Charity: Water, and the guy bid a couple of thousand bucks. He was awesome. We really hit it off.\nDo you think most Tour pros could stand to loosen up?\nI don't think, I know. I mean, I'm very serious between the ropes at times, especially when it's not going well. I can feel like I can't let myself have a good time. But guys need to pick their chin up a little bit and look around. Dude, you're on the PGA Tour! You've probably dreamed about this since you were a kid. It's so fun. I don't care if you just made double; you have the opportunity to look at a kid and throw him a ball and make his day. I try to remember that.\nYou show full comedic commitment in your spoof videos, which you have to do to make them work. Your wardrobe gets laughs, too. Where did the helmet come from? In the video where you offer exercise tips, it's a crucial prop, along with the unitard.\nMy buddy went to Goodwill and found it. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" It's a low-end ski helmet. I never picked up on that until the fifth video. That whole outfit is like five bucks at Good-will. It's awful. It's so tight. It doesn't breathe. It would be great in the Oregon fall, for surfing.\nWho are your favorite comedians? Have you seen Borat?\nI have not seen Borat. Honestly, the stuff that Joel [Stock], my caddie, and I have seen -- he has a great sense of humor and a great memory for funny lines -- would be \"Coming to America,\" \"Spies Like Us,\" \"Caddyshack\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\"\nRight. Kind of like \"Life of Pi.\" At the end you go, \"Ah, now it makes sense.\"\nUnfortunately, \"Planes.\" It was a big letdown. \"Shrek\" was amazing. \"Cars\" was amazing. \"Planes\" was not. And \"Finding Nemo\" was great.\nYou have three kids, so it's obvious who's picking the movies. What TV shows do you watch?\nYou know, I'm trying to think if I've turned on the TV this year for something other than sports. I watched the Bible documentary. When you have three kids under 6, you have to ask, am I going to space out on the couch for an hour and a half, or am I going to hang out with my kids? When your kids are grown up and out of the house, everyone says, \"It happened so fast. I wish they were back.\"\nMusician Mat Kearney helped with the lyrics on Golf Boys 2.0 and the Bubble Boy video, which poked fun at you for being 125th on the money list at the Barclays. Which video took the longest to make?\nGolf Boys 2.0 was six weeks of talking to the production crew and doing some of the writing with Kearney, and giving feedback and stuff. The shoot only took two days, but afterward, editing and stuff, it was a couple of months. We shot it at Vaquero here in Dallas.\nDid everyone stay at your house?\nThey did, except for Hunter, who lives here. Bubba bought my daughter her first Elmo. He's awesome with kids. And Rickie was on the floor rolling around with them. It was funny; we were driving to the course and one of Kearney's songs came on the radio. I was sitting there thinking, What do you do when you're sitting right next to a guy whose song is on the radio? Do you sing along?\nDo you ever play money games with Ryan Palmer or Todd Hamilton or any of the other pros who live and play at Vaquero?\nI should, but it's really just practice. I like playing in the Phil money game, the Mickelson game on Tuesdays. It's competitive. I've played in that a few times, and you're so ready to play in the tournament after that.\nMickelson loves to get in guys' ears. Give us your best Phil smack-talking story.\nA few months back, Phil and I were playing a match in an off-week, and we were on the 10th green, both about eight feet away for birdie. He said, \"I found the secret to putting.\" And I said, \"Really?\" Well, I make my putt and he misses, and because he's always jabbing me, I say, \"Looks like I had the secret to putting on that one.\" He thinks about it for about 10 seconds and says, \"Yeah, but I had the secret to putting at the British Open.\" [Laughs] Yes, he did.\nYou rapped with Bubba Watson on the 16th tee during the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Were you more nervous for that or the golf?\nI was going to do it anyway. I had the helmet in the bag and everything. And then Bubba and I got paired together. I mean, are you kidding me? It was perfect. And there's a guy who stands up there and says, \"Hey, crowd, be quiet,\" and so we went over and grabbed his microphone. But, yeah, I was nervous.\nRory Sabbatini famously left you in the dust at the 2005 Booz Allen at Congressional. Have you gotten much faster with your pace of play since then?\nRory and I are friends, and I've tried to get better. Last year I talked to Jon Brendle, a Tour official, and they see everything. I said, \"Hey, how am I doing?\" His reaction was very positive. He said, \"Just keep up with the group in front of you.\" I don't want guys to get bummed out when they get paired with me. I didn't even know in high school and college golf that I was slow. No one ever said anything.\nYou beat Rory Mcllroy 8 and 7 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play in 2011, and later that year you made eight birdies in the last 11 holes to force a playoff with Webb Simpson in the McGladrey Classic, which you then won. Were you hotter when you thumped Rory or when you beat Webb?\nWhen I made those eight birdies, I got so hot with the putter. Webb told me he went back and watched the broadcast, like, six months later. He said, \"I got so mad. They were going in from across the green!\" With Rory, I was playing some of the best golf of my life, but my back went out the next morning on the range.\nYou finished the year 139th in driving distance. Was that because of your back?\nMy clubhead speed on the Nation-wide Tour was about 124 miles an hour. If I saw the front lip of a bunker 300 yards out, I wouldn't even think about it -- I'd just fly it. I was so long. I was No. 1 in driving distance for the first five months of the season out there, but then I got injured and stopped working on being fast, and now I'm way down in driving distance. [Laughs] I can't smoke it anymore.\nDid that inspire you to become a better short-game player?\nIt contributed to it. Plus, when you're not feeling well you can at least work on your chipping and putting, which I did. I would swing on a launch monitor and think about how I could get faster. I went from 115 mph to 124 mph in about a year.\nYou've worked with short-game coach James Sieckmann for a few years. How much of your short-game prowess do you owe to him? Why do you two click?\nI was having some trouble with my chipping and pitching, with my contact, especially on Bermuda grass with tight lies. I was like, \"I'm missing something.\" I spoke to Tom Pernice, who said, \"You should go see my guy.\" I said, \"You've got a guy?\" It's been dynamite. I think I'm top 10 in bunker play. He really understands the mental game, too.\nHave you also seen improvement in your wedge play?\nI'm much more confident with that 50-yard shot, the 60-yard shot, just because he's taught me proper technique and how to practice for that shot. The difference between the best player in the world and the guy who finishes 100th on the money list is not much -- maybe one shot a round.\nIt's a fine line out there. \"It's a fine line between clever and stupid.\" Do you know what that's from?\n\"This Is Spinal Tap.\" Have you seen that film?\nYou have to see \"Spinal Tap\"! For a comedy lover, it's an absolute must.\nOkay, it's on my list. I'll write it down.\nYou used to not look at the Tour pairings to see who you were playing with the next day, in case it was someone you grew up idolizing. Do you still not look?\nI still don't look. The Tour sends you your tee time for the next day, but it goes to my caddie's phone, it goes to my wife's phone, but not to my phone. Some guys will spoil the surprise and say, \"Looks like it's you and me tomorrow.\"\nYou learned the game at the age of 5 from your grandfather, right?\nYeah, my grandpa was like my best friend, and if I wanted to hang out with him we were going to play golf. The cool thing was, he had three old guys he played with, and one of his cronies died when I was 8 or 10, so I took his spot. We gambled a lot. We played a dime a hole, and double or nothing on 18, so it was big money. That was when I learned to love the game. That was at Portland Golf Club, which we live a block away from in the summer.\nAre you a member there?\nYeah, they gave me an honorary membership. They have a plaque saying that that's where I learned to play. There's a lot of history there. They had a Ryder Cup in . Hogan played there, and a lot of the greats, so they're like, \"Do you want us to put your plaque up?\" [Laughs] I'm like, \"No, no, in the ground is fine.\" So they put it in the ground next to the putting green.\nYou're a big tennis fan. What else did you play as a kid?\nI'd seen my dad going to work every day [he owned a small media-development firm] and I thought, That looks terrible. I've got to figure out professional sports. I played basketball until 10th grade, but I was vertically challenged and maybe the fourth-best player on my team. Soccer, I was the third-best guy on my team. Baseball, I'm kind of afraid of the ball. Golf, well, I was the best golfer of my five friends, so I decided to go for it. I quit everything else, practiced every day as hard as I could. The pro I worked with growing up used to say, \"I think if I worked a little harder I could've made it.\" I thought, I'll never say that.\nSo you got your 10,000 hours in.\nThirty-five thousand -- I added 'em up.\nSo you should be really good by now, given you've put in more than three times as much as the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell recommends in his book \"Outliers.\"\nI read \"Bounce\" [by Matthew Syed] and \"Talent is Overrated\" [by Geoff Colvin]. I think Bounce is the best one. He proved that guys like Mozart, Roger Federer -- it has nothing to do with genes; it's about putting in specific, intense hours of practice. Of course, you can't play post for the Houston Rockets if you're my size.\nSo you don't think you have any more innate ability at golf than a bogey golfer?\nNo. I think we all have unique gifts, but just about anyone can train to be just about anything.\nWell, that's both encouraging and discouraging. Four victories on Tour, two Web.com wins -- are you done? You're 37, and you've got a bad back. Is this it?\nNo. I'm planning to do the Steve Stricker thing. I'm planning to go to 47, and I'm planning to have the best decade of my career from 37 to 47. I am so confident that my best golf is in front of me -- and this is the shooter's mentality in basketball -- that I'm thinking of putting money down on myself in Vegas.",

(\u201cEuro Disney\u201d), representing 9% of Euro Disney\u2019s outstanding shares.\n\u2013 The proposed transaction will increase Disney\u2019s interest in Euro Disney to 85.7% from 76.7%.\n\u2013 The price for the transaction is \u20ac2.00 per share and will be paid in shares of Disney common stock.\n\u2013 Disney also announces its intention to make a cash tender offer for all remaining outstanding shares of Euro Disney at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, representing a 67% premium to Euro Disney\u2019s trading price at its close on February 9, 2017.\n\u2013 Subsequent to the completion of the tender offer, Disney is committed to support a recapitalization of up to \u20ac1.5 billion for the Euro Disney group of companies (\u201cGroup\u201d) to address the Group\u2019s financial needs.\nPARIS, Feb. 10, 2017 \u2013 Today The Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201c) announced that it will acquire through one of its subsidiaries 90% of Kingdom Holding Company\u2019s (\u201cKingdom\u201d) shares in Euro Disney S.C.A. (\u201cEuro Disney\u201d) at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, increasing its interest in Euro Disney to 85.7%. Disney also announced that this subsidiary intends to make a cash tender offer for all remaining outstanding shares of Euro Disney at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, representing a 67% premium to the trading price at the close on February 9, 2017. Moreover, Disney has informed Euro Disney that it is committed to support a recapitalization of up to \u20ac1.5 billion for the Euro Disney group of companies (\u201cGroup\u201d) to enable the Group to continue implementation of improvements to Disneyland\u00ae Paris, reduce debt and increase liquidity.\n\u2013 If Euro Disney remains a listed company, Disney would expect the recapitalization to take the form of a subscription by the applicable Disney subsidiaries of their pro-rata share of a \u20ac1.23 billion rights offering by Euro Disney together with a backstop of (and at the same price as) the rights offering by one or more of such subsidiaries, ensuring that Euro Disney will be able to raise the full amount contemplated by the rights offering, combined with a direct \u20ac270 million cash investment in equity at the level of Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A., the main operating subsidiary of Euro Disney, and contribution of the proceeds of the rights offering by Euro Disney to Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A. to maintain the ownership level of Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A. by Euro Disney at its current 82%. Proceeds would be used to enable the Group to continue implementation of improvements to Disneyland Paris, repay most or all of the Group\u2019s indebtedness and increase liquidity. The rights offering described above would be subject to the prior approval of Euro Disney\u2019s shareholders at a shareholders\u2019 meeting.\n\u2013 If Euro Disney is delisted, Disney would expect the recapitalization to be in the same amount and to also consist entirely of equity contributions to the Group, but the allocation of such contributions between Euro Disney and its subsidiaries could vary compared to what is described above. The proceeds would be used for the same purposes as described above.\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading diversified international entertainment and media enterprise with the following business segments: media networks, parks and resorts, studio entertainment, and consumer products and interactive media. Disney is a Dow 30 company and had annual revenues of $55.6 billion in its Fiscal Year 2016.\nFounded in 1980, Kingdom Holding Company is a publicly traded company, which was listed on Tadawul (the Saudi Stock Exchange) in 2007.

More details on the BYOM page.\nIn 2018/2019 we will be producing a user-friendly software for GUTS. More information.\n1 February 2018: New versions of BYOM and the GUTS package. See the BYOM page.\n12 May 2017: Spotted a small error in BYOM when calculatin the intervals on LC50s with the likelihood-region method. This corrected in a small update to version 4.01.\n27-28 April 2017: Release of BYOM 4.0 on the BYOM page. This is a major update, with many new features, but old scripts and packages will not work anymore! All packages have been updated; the two GUTS packages have been combined, and some have been renamed for clarity.\n6 April 2017: Added the Beta 3 test version of BYOM 4.0 on the BYOM page. Also a new version of the GUTS package is included.\n15 February 2017: Added a Beta test version of BYOM 4.0 on the BYOM page. This is still under testing, but feel free to play with it. Also, I added some warnings for users of profiling and slice sampling with BYOM.\n5 January 2017: New version of the BYOM platform available for download.\n7 April 2016. Small update of the BYOM modelling framework in Matlab.\n25 and 27 August: another update of BYOM (sorry, found some small errors again). Additionally, an updated version of the DEBtox1 package (also demonstrating the improved population growth rate calculation). Updates of GUTS1 and DEBkiss1 packages. And ... a totally new package: DEBkiss_tox1, which is DEBkiss turned into a TKTD model. 29 August: update of the GUTS2 and DEBkiss2 package as well. All packages now have a walk through.\n21 August: update of BYOM. Corrected a few errors and added some new functionality that will be demonstrated in future packages.\n30 June 2015: update of BYOM. Corrected some errors and included a few extra options.\n17 April 2015: update of DEBtoxM flavours Surv, GUTS and DEBtox. The DEB3 flavour is no longer offered.\n3 April 2015: major update of BYOM. Some alternative optimisation methods are included, plus the possibility to fit parameters on log-scale. And ... the possibility to publish the code in Matlab (see the walkthrough of the BYOM code). Also a new version of the manual is provided.\n18 February 2015: update of BYOM and the GUTS2 package. Main change is to avoid warnings with newer versions on Matlab (due to different way of dealing with interpolations), and the option to plot in black-and-white with different symbols (as in the DEBtoxM flavours).\n2 January 2015: tiny 2.02 update for BYOM, and extended the BYOM manual, and gave a seperate entry on the BYOM download page.\n17 December 2014: New version of the BYOM files to version 2.0. Major change is the possibility to have more than one data set per stage, and a brand new simulation engine. As of version 1.5, cleaner and simpler BYOM scripts. New packages for GUTS, DEBtox and some nice examples for the simulator! (Version 2.01 also has a small update to the manual).\n29 November 2014: New version of the BYOM files. Major change is the removal of the calculation and plotting from the basic script into an engine script, which takes away a lot of complexity from the user.\n1 May 2014. New version 1.5 of BYOM files posted over here. Also, a new package general package for DEBkiss.\n29 Jan. 2013.

    "text": "New York, NY - January 15, 2014 - Today, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer announced that he has received a commitment that John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) will be assigned additional customs agents as the result of increased appropriations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill. This bill has boosted CBP\u2019s funding by $165.7 million in order for the agency to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide. Specifically, the bill increases CBP\u2019s overall budget to $10.6 billion, which is over $220 million more than FY2013. Schumer explained that $165.7 million of the new funding was explicitly prescribed \u201cfor the purpose of hiring, training, and equipping new U.S. customs and border protection offices.\u201d During a confirmation hearing today, Schumer secured a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske, who is currently undergoing the confirmation process to be Commissioner of CBP, that he would commit to bringing an adequate portion of these new agents and resources to JFK once he has been confirmed.\nIn September 2013, Schumer made an appeal to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement new measures that would help alleviate incredibly long lines for travelers using customs at JFK and he continued his push at a confirmation hearing today for Kerlikowske. Schumer\u2019s appeal comes after a report revealed that customs lines at JFK Airport were among the longest wait times in the country. According to the report, the average delay during peak hours could be two hours or more.\nOn July 1, 2013, at 6 am, the wait was 140 minutes.\nOn August 3, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 120 minutes.\nOn August 24, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 3 hours.\nSchumer has long advocated measures to decrease these wait times, including a personal call in September to then-Acting DHS Secretary Rand Beers, during which Schumer asked Beers to approve and install new automated Passport kiosks, as well as assign additional Custom and Border Patrol agents at JFK. Schumer also urged his colleagues to boost funding for the Customs and Border Protection in the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill, above the current 2013 levels and called current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to press his case.\nToday, Schumer announced that the recently released appropriations agreement called for $165.7 million to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide, and that he has received a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske that, when confirmed as Commissioner of CBP, he will assign an adequate portion of these new agents to JFK. These additional agents will enable the airport to decrease wait times and continue to be a major economic driver.",

    "text": "What Impact Will a 9% Drop in Profits Have On Your Organization?\nUnless your Supply Management organization takes it to the next level, your company is facing a 9% drop in corporate profits this year due to rising prices and other inflationary pressure according to a recent Hackett Group study. For a typical Global 1000 company with 27.8 billion in revenue, Hackett\u2019s study estimated that commodity and offshore labor inflation will drive a 150 million per year hit to the bottom line. Ouch!\nWhy? While most companies are now able to effectively anticipate commodity price increases, more than 60% of companies surveyed by Hackett in the recent study have not been successful at mitigating these cost increases. The reality is that few executives have experienced significant inflation, which is now at levels not seen in 30 years (when inflation rates hovered around 13% back in 1981).\nAnd while inflation may not yet be at 13%, it is bad. Not only do respondents to the Hackett study expect the rate of inflation for commodities overall to rise by more than 30%, to 6.3% a year, but commodity price volatility has increased nearly 60% since before the recession. Making matters worse, at the same time, due to the talent crunch, the rate for internal labor is expected to more than triple from 0.7% to 2.2% and the rate of inflation for external labor is expected to more than double from 1.2% to 3%.\nThis entry was posted in Analyst, Economics on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nRegular readers of SI will know the importance of good should-cost modeling (which is also great for negotiations) as well as good market intelligence (which has dimensions and is valuable in a down economy) in cost reduction and avoidance. And while both should-cost modelling and market intelligence have a number of critical requirements that must be met for success, they both have one key requirement in common \u2014 good data. But where do you get good data? Certainly not from supplier bids! A new supplier is going to bid what it thinks it can get, not what the actual price is. Market indices from governments and professional associations? Better, but they will typically be at least a month or so behind. Trade associations that track and monitor prices on a daily basis or stock markets that trade the commodity? Great \u2014 but do you have the IT skills to integrate the feeds? And are you going to do it for the dozens of raw materials and commodities you need to build your should cost models?\nTo help their clients understand the data, Mintec provides a data analysis package, called Datagain, which can be used to import, graph, analyze, and compare different line items (such as the petrol price in the UK and the petrol price in Australia, normalized to US dollars). A user can graph any set of series, against any frequency, using any (currency and unit) converions, for any date range she chooses. She can also normalize or index this data using a custom formula, factor in seasonality, and plot trends. She can also break the series down across two or four graphs and/or plot specific subseries, against different projections, to see how the price might trend over time under different assumptions. The normalization / indexing equations can use all of the standard algebraic operators and be defined over any set of variables, including user defined variables, that the user chooses.\nIf the user is not sophisticated at trend analysis, or does not want to do it, Mintec also offers Benchmarking and Market (Intelligence) Report services that do a deep dive into a particular raw material, commodity, or service that discuss recent, current, and projected pricing subject to the state of the market and the dominant factors at play. These, by request, reports complement the monthly market reports and commodity fact sheets that track the major commodities and markets and their relative month-over-month changes for buyers who want to look at the bigger picture. If the user wants to learn more about Datagain, analysis, and should-cost modeling, Mintec also provides on-demand out-of-the-box and customized training sessions as well as quarterly newsletters and occasional articles.\nIt\u2019s a huge amount of data, that comes at a very low price point. Most customers pay less than 100K \u00a3s for access to the data they need, when they need it, updated as often as they like. Moreover, medium-sized business can get basic access (to the datafeeds) and access to the desktop Datagain tool for as little as 10K \u00a3s a year. Large enterprises will probably want the on-line hosted applet version (at the higher price-point) that runs through the browser on a hosted database that is accessible anywhere, anytime, and always up to date. While it is more expensive, it\u2019s still cheap compared to what the organization will be paying for their ERP solution (and much more valuable from a cost avoidance perspective).\nThis entry was posted in Best Practices, Market Intelligence on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nTMS Requires 100 Million, Does ERP Require 1 Billion?\nBen Pivar, Vice President and North American Supply Chain Lead for Capgemini regarding Transportation Management Systems (TMS) Pivar says that the economics of installing a TMS package on a client server, for example, doesn\u2019t really work until you have nearly $100 million in freight spend and that\u2019s why on-demand is so popular in that space.\nSI has to agree. Unless a firm has tens of millions in freight spend, the costs of installation, maintenance, and usage tend to dwarf the benefits of using a TMS system. However, what\u2019s even more important to note is that enterprise ERP (from a top vendor) is, on average, at least five, if not (usually) ten times, more expensive to install, integrate, maintain, and use than TMS. This would seem to indicate that the economics of traditional ERP don\u2019t make sense unless your company has 1 Billion in spend, or at least 1 Billion in revenue. In other words, unless you\u2019re a member of the Fortune 2000 or Global 3000, traditional end-to-end on-premise enterprise ERP is probably not for you. And it would appear that Oracle, one of the largest players, tends to agree. Why do you think it has advertisements stating it has 98% of the Fortune 500? It\u2019s not just because the Fortune X, it\u2019s target market, provide it with its biggest deals. It\u2019s because Oracle also understands that unless a company has reached a critical mass, given the cost of the system, the company won\u2019t get the advertised return (which is a key to keeping the company as a high-paying customer year after year).\nHowever, every organization needs a good transaction store and data repository as analysis is key to supply management success. So what does this mean if you\u2019re not one of the lucky ones? Don\u2019t look at a a tradtional on-premise end-to-end ERP from a big boy. Look at either a newer, smaller, slimmed down offering from a smaller player, possibly based on an open-source solution (like Compiere), a suite from a provider that maintains its own transaction store, or a newer, slimmed down, SaaS offering from a traditional provider that can integrate with some BoB solutions in the cloud and offer an effective hybrid solution. Just don\u2019t go for the billion-dollar solution, because your organization likely won\u2019t get a return from the millions it will cost.\nThis entry was posted in Inventory, Logistics, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nCheck out the live debate in two hours (@ 2pm EDT) between Paul Martyn, VP of Supply Strategy at BravoSolution, and Howard Coleman, principal of MCA Associates, to find out.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nAs per yesterday\u2019s post, it\u2019s been less than five months since we last checked in with Trade Extensions, who had traded up to a Fact Sheet User Interface and added a slew of new features, including improved RFI support, multi-dimensional rankings in e-Negotiation, Google Earth integration, new incumbent rules, and an OLAP foundation to reporting, including the implementation of a new n-way comparison report. Since then, Trade Extensions has been on a tear to add new functionality as fast as it can to make the platform not only one of the most powerful expressive bidding optimization platforms on the planet, but also one of the easiest to use \u2014 listening to its users (which include the Fortune 1000) and adding features and functions that make an average buyer\u2019s life easier, taking usability to a whole new level yet again. And while earth-shattering technology improvements are cool, it is usability that is the ultimate key to to adoption, use, and, ultimately, cost avoidance and reduction in your sourcing organization.\nNot only are there new rules that allow partial awards to be fixed based upon existing scenarios, but the number of constraint categories has doubled. While there were only general and incumbent constraints in the past, there are now an entire category of scenario reference rules and post processing rules. With respect to scenario reference rules, not only can allocations be kept, but bids can be favoured or penalized as well. The post-processing rules are also quite useful. Allocations can automatically be rounded and allocations that don\u2019t meet a minimum number of units can be removed (or re-assigned to the supplier who meets a minimum allocation with the lowest total cost).\nThe buyer now has fine-grained control over what the supplier sees, and can even mix feedback types. For example, if the buyer only wants the top three suppliers to know they are top three, but suppliers four to six to know their exact rank, they can specify that specific rank starts at bidder four, and the top bidders default to \u201ctop 3\u201d. In addition, if the supplier does not meet a minimum bid increment, which can be defined in a number of ways (including, minimum dollar or % decrease over last bid), the supplier gets a nice red error that the bid is not acceptable AND a message indicating the minimum increment required. Finally, and this is really cool, the user can define custom color-coded bid feedback fields based on dynamic formulas that now only let the user know where they rank, but how competitive their bid is (against the current bids from the competition) in English using a buyer defined scale such as \u201cCompetitive\u201d, \u201cSlightly Competitive\u201d, \u201cNot Competitive\u201d, and \u201cNot Acceptable\u201d.\nPlus, the buyer can now chat with users online in an integrated IM client, and immediately see who is online when they log in as it is a widget on their project management dashboard.\nThe \u201cdashboards\u201d for RFX and auction phases have also improved. The summary, bidder summary, and lot summary are now completely customizeable by the user, support custom fields, and user-defined colour codings in the rankings. In addition, there is integrated show/hide, drill-down functionality, and customizeable pop-up (bid, trend, and bidder activity) charts where a user can select one, some, or all of the rows in each report.\nAll and all, it\u2019s a lot of new functionality in a short time frame that makes the tool extremely useable by an average buyer.\nThis entry was posted in Decision Optimization, Spend Analysis, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.",

    "text": "The courts don\u2019t expect your company\u2019s OHS program to be perfect. To make out a due diligence defence, your company must prove only that it made reasonable efforts to comply with the law and protect workers\u2019 health and safety. But the courts do expect you to take all reasonable steps toward compliance\u2014not just some steps.\n> Institute a formal hazard assessment for any work or activity in the areas where asbestos was present [R. v. Della Valle]. .\nThe OHS laws only require companies to protect workers from reasonably foreseeable hazards. The standard for determining whether a hazard was foreseeable is not what risks the company actually did foresee but what a reasonably prudent person in the same situation would have foreseen. If a safety incident or violation was foreseeable, the company will be held liable if it didn\u2019t take all reasonable steps to prevent the incident or violation.\nExample: A backhoe operator snagged a natural gas riser, causing gas to seep into a nearby butcher shop. The shop exploded, killing two people, seriously injuring five others and causing extensive property damage. The operator was convicted of two OHS violations. The court pointed out that the operator knew the risk of working around live gas lines and the potentially serious consequences of hitting a gas line with his backhoe. So doing so was clearly a foreseeable hazard. But the operator, who had plenty of time, didn\u2019t take reasonable steps to avoid snagging a gas line, such as carefully digging with a shovel to expose the riser. In short, the court called the operator\u2019s actions incredibly risky and the incident \u201centirely foreseeable\u201d [R. v. Riemer]. .\nIf a hazard was not only foreseeable but actually known to the company, failing to address it is fatal to successfully arguing that you exercised due diligence.\nExample #1: During blasting for a roadway construction project, flyrock showered a nearby trailer court, destroying a shed, crashing through a trailer\u2019s roof and forcing a tenant to run for safety. The contractor and a supervisor were convicted of OHS violations and appealed. In upholding their convictions, the court noted that they knew damage from blasting was foreseeable because a prior blast during this project had caused flyrock to reach the same trailer court, thus demonstrating what could happen if proper safety precautions weren\u2019t followed. The practical wisdom from that prior incident should\u2019ve \u201cinformed reasonableness and safe practice,\u201d said the court. It added, \u201cPast experience can be a reliable predictor of future incidents or damage\u201d [R. v. Government of Yukon].\nExample #2: A technology company held a customer appreciation event that featured a mechanical calf roping machine operated by the company\u2019s employees. The machine had a faulty spring. So the operator had to reach into it to manually release a hook. While a worker was doing so, he was hit in the back of the head by a steel lever and died. The appeals court pointed out that before the fatality, another worker operating the machine had been hit on the shoulder by the lever. So although the specific type of injury the worker who died suffered may not have been foreseen, the potential danger of being struck by this lever while reaching into the machine was a \u201creasonable prospect,\u201d explained the court. Once this hazard was detected, a reasonable employer would have discontinued use of the machine and not permitted untrained workers to operate it. But despite being aware of the potential dangers associated with the machine, the company allowed the continued use of this equipment [R. v. XI Technologies Inc.]. .\nYour company\u2019s safety rules and procedures must be in writing. Verbal safety procedures are too easily misunderstood, which can have serious\u2014and often fatal\u2014consequences. Written safety procedures that spell out exactly what\u2019s required and when are less likely to be misunderstood. As a result, courts will typically rule that due diligence requires written safety procedures.\nYes, your OHS program must include thorough, written safety rules and procedures. But that\u2019s not enough to prove due diligence. You must also properly train workers on those rules and procedures. And that training must be adequate.\nExample #1: In the Linamar case discussed above, the court ruled that the employer needed to develop not only a written policy on troubleshooting but also a related program for training workers on that policy.\nExample #2: A flagger working along a highway was run over by an excavator operated by a co-worker and crushed to death. His employer was convicted of, among other things, failing to provide proper training to workers at the site. The court found that although the employer provided some instruction and training to workers, it was minimal and not to the extent required to prove due diligence [R. v. Concord Paving Ltd.].\nProviding adequate training to workers isn\u2019t going to help you prove due diligence if you can\u2019t demonstrate that you provided such training. So you must document the nature and extent of the training the company provides its workers.\nExample #1: In the Concord Paving case discussed above, the court noted that the employer\u2019s OHS program manual contained a form for documenting the safety courses that workers took. But at trial, it didn\u2019t produce any such forms for the workers involved in the incident to prove that they\u2019d taken any safety courses.\nExample #2: A temporary worker for a salvage company fell approximately three metres from an opening in a wall onto a pile of pipe, suffering a broken leg and three broken ribs. The company was convicted of several safety violations. Among other factors that led to a finding of no due diligence, the court said that although the company claimed that it provided workers with a safety orientation, it had no documentation to prove that claim [R. v. Canadian Consolidated Salvage Ltd. (Clearway Recycling)].\nAs important as adequate training is, you must also ensure that workers are appropriately supervised while on the job in order to prove due diligence. That\u2019s because proper supervision is the best way to ensure workers are actually applying their training.\nExample: At a bridge construction project, a safety inspector saw workers working 20 to 50 feet above the ground without adequate fall protection in the form of guardrails or handrails. In addition, the workers were attached to a horizontal lifeline that wasn\u2019t properly engineered. The employer appealed its conviction for violating the fall protection and supervision requirements, pointing to the training it provided to workers on fall protection. But the Tribunal explained, \u201cTraining alone does not meet the requirements of due diligence, if there is not adequate supervision to ensure that the knowledge provided through training is being correctly and consistently applied\u201d [WCAT-2012-00224].\nAnd the need for appropriate supervision applies to all workers\u2014even those who are experienced.\nExample: During an inspection of a residential construction project, a safety officer saw an experienced journeyman carpenter working about 18 feet above the ground without his fall protection harness attached to a lifeline. The construction company was penalized for fall protection violations, which it appealed. The Tribunal acknowledged that the carpenter had more than 20 years\u2019 experience and was familiar with the fall protection requirements. In fact, he admitted that he should\u2019ve attached his harness to a lifeline. But the Tribunal noted that there was no evidence that he was properly supervised to ensure he complied with these requirements. It appears that the company simply opted to rely on his experience, training and knowledge [WCAT-2012-00416].\nCompanies have a duty to ensure that workers follow safety rules and procedures and comply with the OHS laws. To that end, you should take steps to convey to workers the importance of safety compliance\u2014and the ramifications of safety infractions. For example, when workers violate safety rules, you must discipline them.\nExample #1: At a residential construction site, a safety officer saw two workers, who were approximately 18 feet above the ground, not wearing fall protection harnesses. And there was no fall protection equipment on the roof. The construction company was penalized for a fall protection violation and appealed. The employer argued that it provided extensive training on fall protection requirements. But the Tribunal said the company\u2019s training and education efforts weren\u2019t sufficient for workers to understand the importance of complying with those requirements or the consequences of non-compliance. For example, the company didn\u2019t implement a progressive discipline program for safety infractions until after this incident [WCAT-2011-02413].\nExample #2: A safety officer inspecting a roofing project saw a worker and supervisor on a roof about 24 feet above the ground when neither was connected to a lifeline. During an inspection of another company worksite, two workers on a roof weren\u2019t connected to lifelines. The company was penalized for failing to comply with the fall protection requirements and provide adequate training and supervision. It appealed. The Tribunal said that although the company provided fall protection training and had a progressive discipline program for safety infractions, it knew that workers were ignoring the fall protection requirements. So it should\u2019ve realized that its efforts weren\u2019t preventing or deterring fall protection violations and done more, such as providing bonuses for safety compliance [WCAT-2011-02507].\nWhen a company is charged with a safety offence, it may try to point the finger at the workers involved, arguing that it took all reasonable steps and the workers simply disregarded safety protocol. Such an argument is unlikely to convince a court.\nExample #1: In WCAT-2011-02413 discussed above, the company argued that it was the independent actions of the workers that led to the violations, saying they forgot to put their fall protection equipment back on after their lunch break. The Tribunal noted that although the workers themselves could\u2019ve been hit with violations for their actions, their failure doesn\u2019t relieve the company of its duties under the OHS laws.\nExample #2: In Linamar, which was previously discussed, the employer argued that the worker got injured because he didn\u2019t use a spotter as required. But the court noted that the training wasn\u2019t clear as to the proper use of a spotter.\nBecause supervisors are responsible for ensuring that workers follow safety rules and comply with the OHS law, they should be held to a higher standard when it comes to safety infractions. So when a supervisor violates a safety rule, the consequences should be more severe than if a worker had committed the same infraction.\nExample: In WCAT-2011-02507 mentioned above, a worker and supervisor were seen by a safety inspector not wearing fall protection equipment when required. But the Tribunal said it wasn\u2019t apparent that the company held the supervisor more accountable for his actions than the worker, noting \u201cthe supervisor is responsible for setting an example to workers.\u201d In fact, the employer simply gave both a verbal warning.\nYou must ensure that workers are supervised by actual supervisors and not leave that responsibility to their co-workers.\nExample: A 22-year-old sawmill worker got caught in the pinchpoint of a canter machine and died. The sawmill was convicted of violating the supervision requirements. The Tribunal noted that the worker was young and had been on the job for less than a year. A supervisor had warned him before this incident about performing duties that weren\u2019t his own. Under these circumstances, he should\u2019ve been closely supervised but he wasn\u2019t. The fact that there were experienced and knowledgeable co-workers working in the same area as this worker wasn\u2019t a substitute for the presence of an actual supervisor. So the Tribunal concluded that the sawmill failed to satisfy its duty to provide adequate supervision [WCAT-2011-02783].\nIn general, employers can\u2019t avoid fulfilling their OHS duties by delegating them to someone else, such as a contractor or subcontractor.\nExample #1: In Canadian Consolidated Salvage, previously discussed, the company argued that the prime contractor was responsible for supervising all workers\u2014including the company\u2019s\u2014and complying with all safety requirements. So it had no duty to ensure the safety of its workers at that site. But the court said because the company was the injured worker\u2019s employer under the OHS laws, it was responsible for ensuring his safety at the site. And there was no evidence that the company took \u201cany steps whatsoever\u201d to protect its workers.\nExample #2: The contractor and supervisor in the Yukon case argued that hiring an experienced blaster relieved them of their duties under the OHS law. The court explained that the OHS law has \u201coverlapping obligations\u201d that mean everyone had a duty to ensure a safe blast. And there was no evidence that the contractor had a system in place to ensure that all blasting was done safely.\nThe same rule applies to suppliers who provide you with equipment and materials.\nExample: In the XI Technologies case, the company argued that it wasn\u2019t foreseeable that the supplier would provide it with an unsafe machine. In essence, the company assumed that the equipment would be safe to use. But the appeals court explained that the OHS law required the company, as an employer, to take reasonable steps to ensure that such equipment was, in fact, safe to operate as intended. And there were \u201crudimentary steps\u201d the company could\u2019ve taken to do so. For example, the company should\u2019ve asked the supplier for adequate operating instructions or a demonstration of the machine\u2019s proper use, especially considering that it was completely unfamiliar with this equipment. This relatively simple step would\u2019ve alerted operators to the fact that the machine wasn\u2019t working properly. But instead of getting instructions or a demonstration from the supplier, the company chose to rely on its untrained employees to figure out how to safely run the machine.\nCompanies must give workers the information they need to perform their jobs safely, such as MSDSs and safety signage. If that information is inaccurate, it\u2019s almost as bad as\u2014if not worse than\u2014not providing the information at all.\nExample: A safety officer discovered that there were stickers posted in areas on a seagoing vessel that said the areas were \u201casbestos-free\u201d even though materials containing asbestos were present. In ruling that the company didn\u2019t exercise due diligence, the Tribunal pointed out that the company couldn\u2019t explain how inaccurate decals had been put up. And it didn\u2019t have a system in place for double-checking or otherwise ensuring the accuracy of such signage [WCAT-2012-00145].\nCompanies are composed of human beings and humans make mistakes. But courts are unlikely to buy that argument that because a safety violation was simply the product of human error, the company should be excused from liability.\nExample: A safety officer inspecting a construction site found that the company hadn\u2019t gotten an underground locate of all utility services before starting excavation work. The company\u2019s excuse for this oversight was that it was \u201cdue to human error.\u201d But the Tribunal rejected this excuse as non-responsive. It pointed out that \u201caccidents are usually due to human error.\u201d The issue here was whether the company took steps to prevent this particular human error from occurring, which it hadn\u2019t [WCAT-2012-00070].\nMost safety violations are the result of flaws in the OHS program of a company that\u2019s genuinely trying to comply but fell short. But if the violations are particularly egregious, say, because they\u2019re the result of wanton disregard for safety or the failure to take simple and inexpensive steps, the company will not only get convicted but likely face an especially high fine.\nExample: A truck driver was killed when a 15-metre-high wall of dirt and rock fell on him. Two companies were convicted of multiple safety violations. That two experienced construction companies could leave a sheer 50-foot wall without any shoring whatsoever was shocking, said the court. It described their conduct as \u201cegregious and outrageous,\u201d noting that the wall could\u2019ve been properly supported for a relatively small amount of money. As a result, the court imposed record fines totally $2,472,500 on the companies [R. v. Perera Development Corp.].\nAs explained in Part 1, there\u2019s no formula for establishing due diligence, no checklist of steps or actions that, if taken, would guarantee a successful due diligence defence. The best you can do is learn from other companies\u2019 experiences in safety prosecutions. The cases in which the due diligence defence failed illustrate what not to do and which omissions will undercut due diligence. The successful cases can provide a sort of blueprint or guide for the steps and actions your company should be taking.\n3. Anyone charged with a violation of the OHS laws, including companies and individuals, can raise a due diligence defence.\n4. The due diligence defence applies to most violations of so-called \u201cregulatory\u201d laws, such as OHS and environmental laws.\n5. Although due diligence isn\u2019t technically a defence to criminal negligence or \u201cC-45\u201d charges, proving that you exercised due diligence makes it impossible to be convicted of criminal negligence.",

    "text": "Home / Blog / Bitqyck Review \u2013 Is This A Good Opportunity Or Big Scam?\nBitqyck Review \u2013 Is This A Good Opportunity Or Big Scam?\nIn the last few weeks, Bitqyck has been getting a lot of attention in the network marketing circles.\nWith all this hype, I am sure you have seen some of your friends trying to sell Bitqyck in your social media feeds.\nThe first thing you need to know is that I am NOT an affiliate or distributor for Bitqyck.\nI wanted to gather all the information about Bitqyck in my Bitqyck Review in order for you to make a decision about joining Bitqyck.\nIs Bitqyck legit or a scam?\nLet me show you in my unbiased review of Bitqyck.\nWhat The Heck Is Bitqyck?\nIn today\u2019s latest review, we\u2019re taking a look at an MLM opportunity by the name of Bitqyck. As the \u201cBit\u201d part of the company\u2019s name might suggest, Bitqyck is the latest company to take a stab at the MLM niche of cryptocurrency.\nFor those that haven\u2019t been following the MLM landscape that closely over the past year or so, the field of cryptocurrency has gotten insanely popular over the past year or so as a new means of making money and offering a new business opportunity.\nLooking at Bitqyck, we\u2019ve got a company that\u2019s based out of Texas in the United States and has a co-founder by the name of Sam Mendez.\nSam Mendez is a name that might be familiar to some of you, and that\u2019s because Bitqyck isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen Mendez get involved with the world of MLM.\nThe first reported company that Sam Mendez was affiliated with was My Shopping Genie, with Mendez showing up once again as the co-founder for this company as well.\nUnfortunately for Sam, My Shopping Genie wasn\u2019t around for too long as it eventually collapsed after a period of six months or of being unable to pay its affiliates.\nFollowing My Shopping Genie\u2019s collapse in mid-2012, Mendez went on to launch 15 Winks in 2014 \u2014 a opportunity that offered a dating app after buying in to a subscription plan.\nCalorchi succeeded 15 Winks in 2016 as an e-commerce platform with a cryptocurrency element, but current Alexa rankings for the Calorchi website indicate that the company shut down around the second half of that same year (2016).\nWhat Are The Bitqyck Products?\nIn regards to the product line that Bitqyck has to offer, the company does\u2019t have any true goods or services that are being sold to retail customers. Instead, Bitqyck sells nothing more than access to its affiliate membership program.\nIf and when someone decides that they\u2019d like to become an affiliate for the company, they will be given the opportunity to invest real dollars into Bitqy. Bitqy is the in-house cryptocurrency that Bitqyck has created, and affiliates are also able to generate sales through an e-commerce platform.\nI tried to look into said platform to see just what it has to offer, but there\u2019s currently not a lot of detailed information about it not he Bitqyck website.\nWhat About The Compensation Plan For Bitqyck?\nMembers of Bitqyck are able to earn money by recruiting other individuals to invest their own dollars into the Bitqy currency and by generating sales through the company\u2019s e-commerce system.\nWhen it comes to investing money into Bitqy, there are three main levels of investment that affiliates have access to. Bitqyck calls these \u201cproduct options\u201d, and the first one sees members investing $199 in order to get $200 worth of Bitqy coins.\nThe product option above this asks affiliates to invest $349 to receive $400 worth of Bitqy, and the last level requires an investment of $499 in order to get a whopping $600 worth of Bitqy.\nCommissions that affiliates have access to are paid out in two main ways, and the first has to do with investing money into the Bitqy coins.\nWhenever a personally recruited affiliate of yours invests their own money into the Bitqy coins, you\u2019re able to earn a 10% commission based off of how much money they decided to invest.\nIn addition to this, you\u2019ve also got access to a matching bonus of 10% for any affiliates that your downline is able to recruit and get to invest as well.\nThe second main commission that affiliates are able to earn come through the e-commerce platform.\nThese commissions are handled in a very unique manner, with a 25% commission being offered to an affiliate who introduces a customer to the platform that then decides to purchase product from it. A 25% commission is also paid out to the affiliate that was behind the recruitment of the referring affiliate in this situation, and that same 25% commission is even offered to the e-commerce merchant and the customer that\u2019s buying from the platform.\nWhat\u2019s The Cost Of Joining Bitqyck?\nIf you\u2019d like to join Bitqyck for whatever reason, the membership is free to start out with.\nWith this being said, you\u2019ll need to either recruit someone who invests at least $199 or make the investment yourself if you\u2019d like to be considered an official affiliate for the company.\nSo, Is There A Bitqyck Scam Going On?\nHave you been hearing rumours that Bitqyck is a scam?\nSo \u2013 what is the truth? Is there really a Bitqyck scam going on?\nIf I am being perfectly honest, Bitqyck isn\u2019t entirely a scam.\nFinally, My Bitqyck Review And Conclusion!\nFrom what I can tell, Bitqyck is simply a relaunch of what Mendez tried before with Calorchi.\nLooking at the company and its e-commerce platform from the perspective of a retail customer, I don\u2019t see anything at all that\u2019s very compelling.\nCustomers don\u2019t care about earning money, they want to save money. Furthermore, if a customer decides they want to buy something form the Bitqyck platform, they\u2019ll need to invest money into Bitqy.\nAt the time of this writing, Bitqy is not tradable on the public market in any fashion. This likely isn\u2019t ever going to change, and with Bitqy not being a public cryptocurrency, Mendez can pretty much set the value of it at whatever he would like.\nThe requirement of having to purchase Bitqy in order to buy items from the e-commerce platform will quickly turn off any real retail clients, leaving the only interested individuals being affiliates who are looking to make a quick buck.\nAffiliates for Bitqyck will more than likely spend the majority of their time focused on investing in Bitqy and recruiting others to do the same, and just like similar opportunities that have come before Bitqyck, the whole operation will start to fall once this recruitment activity dies down.\nI really hope you have gained value from my Bitqyck Review.\nI wanted to make sure you had all the information you needed, because most other Bitqyck reviews are just trying to sell you something.\nIf you really do decide to join Bitqyck, I want you to succeed with your business. Learn how to market yourself properly!",

If datatype is a numeric type, then non-numeric characters are ignored and the numbers are read in the order they appear in the input file. However, note that for the float and double types, the string 'nan' (any case) is read as a valid numerical value. For all the integer types, the prefix '0x' or '0X' signifies a value represented in hexadecimal (base 16). For the 'byte' type only, the prefix '0', not followed by 'x' or 'X', signifies a value represented in octal (base 8).\nAll numeric types require require a separator. A separator is a non-numeric character [eg, space, comma, alphabetic character].\nFor string data, each line of the file is read as a string.\nFor character data, the file is read byte-by-byte.\nAn error message is generated whenever the number of elements read is less than the number implied by the dimensions parameter.\nIf -1 is given for the dimensions parameter, all values in the file will be read into a one-dimensional variable.

If dimensions was equal to -1, then a _FillValue attribute was NOT returned.\nSeveral functions located in contributed.ncl provide additional flexibility for reading ascii files.\nConsider an ASCII file (\"sample.file\") that consists of three \"header\" lines followed by the data array of interest.

Each row has 30 numbers. Unseen at the end of each line is an end-of-line character. Each number is to be interpreted as a numeric type \"byte\".\nThe file can not be directly read as numeric bytes because all numeric types require a non-numeric separator. Also, the 'hidden' end-of-line character complicates the situation. Use of charactertoshort and stringtocharacter can be used to get the desired type \"short\" or \"byte\".\nThe following code snippet will result in each numeric value being separated. The \"ncol+1\" is to account for the hidden end-of-line character. The \"zero_offset\" variable is used to 'normalize' the integer character representation to numeric ibtegers.\nPrinting as byte is done as hexadecimal. The numbers are the same.",

    "text": "Understanding how landscape factors, including suites of geographic and environmental variables, and both historical and contemporary ecological and evolutionary processes shape the distribution of genetic diversity is a primary goal of landscape and conservation genetics and may be particularly consequential for species involved in ecological restoration. In this study, we examine the factors that shape the distribution of genetic variation in a leguminous shrub (Caragana microphylla) important for restoration efforts on the Mongolian Plateau in China. This region houses several major bioclimatic gradients, and C. microphylla is an important restoration species because it stabilizes soils and prevents advancing desertification on the Inner Mongolia Plateau caused by ongoing climate change.\nWe assembled an expansive genomic dataset, consisting of 22 microsatellite loci, four cpDNA regions, and 5788 genome-wide SNPs from ten populations of C. microphylla. We then applied ecological niche modelling and linear and non-linear regression techniques to investigate the historical and contemporary forces that explain patterns of genetic diversity and population structure in C. microphylla on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. We found strong evidence that both geographic and environmental heterogeneity contribute to genetic differentiation and that the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in C. microphylla appears to result partly from the presence of a glacial refugium at the southwestern edge of its current range.\nThese results suggest that geographic, environmental, and historical factors have all contributed to spatial genetic variation in this ecologically important species. These results should guide restoration plans to sustain genetic diversity during plant translocations.\nUnraveling the factors that influence spatial genetic variation and population structure is one of the fundamental goals of ecological and landscape genetics . Patterns of genetic differentiation often reflect spatial variation in gene flow, and landscapes can influence gene flow through geographic and environmental variation and their combined effects [2\u20134]. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) is the correlation of genetic divergence and geographic distances, while isolation-by-environment (IBE) is a correlation between genetic divergence and environmental dissimilarity [5, 6]. IBE can result from environmental differences between populations that generate divergent selection, which reduces dispersal success between different environments, or from biased dispersal, which leads to higher dispersal rates between more similar environments [2, 3, 6, 7]. Thus, both IBD and IBE represent important ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences genetic structure in natural populations [3, 8, 9]. Inherently, geographic and environmental isolation are not mutually exclusive, and spatial genetic divergence among populations can result from reduced gene flow associated with both geographical and ecologic factors [2, 7, 8, 10]. The rise of modern spatial statistical methods and the increasing availability of high-resolution geographic and environmental data layers now make it possible to accurately describe geographic and ecological landscapes and to simultaneously estimate the effects of IBD and IBE on spatial genetic divergence [5, 6]. Understanding patterns of IBD and IBE is particularly important for species of conservation concern or that are involved in ecosystem management, because the outcomes of conservation strategies may depend upon properly managing genetic diversity.\nOne such species is Caragana microphylla, a perennial sandy grassland and desert deciduous shrub species belonging to the legume family (Fabaceae). Native to temperate Asia, including Siberia, Mongolia, and China , C. microphylla is a widely distributed shrub species in the northern steppe and agro-pastoral ecotone of China. On the high plain of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, C. microphylla is a key component of the shrub steppe landscape, and on the sandy land of the steppe it is a dominant species of vegetation . The species has been valued for its tolerance to heat, cold, and drought and for its resistance to wind erosion, sand burial, and hail storms. It has been used as a pioneer leguminous shrub species for vegetation rehabilitation and stabilization of widely degraded and degrading grasslands in China, because of its ability to serve as a windbreak and its capacity for carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, and nutrient accumulation in sandy soils , and it can also be served as supplemental livestock forage with high nutrient value . Genetic variation and population structure of wild C. microphylla from the Inner Mongolia Plateau have been evaluated by different marker systems, including AFLPs, RAPDs, and microsatellites [13\u201317], but no previous studies have quantified the contributions of IBD and IBE to spatial genetic divergence in this system. However, better understanding population dynamics in species like this is an important goal for restoration ecology, ecosystem management, and landscape and conservation genetics. Studies like this one are critical for identifying the factors that shape the distribution of genetic variation in species undergoing assisted dispersal and recolonization so that genetic diversity can be managed properly .\nThe Inner Mongolia Plateau is characterized by pronounced biophysical gradients, presenting an opportunity to investigate the effects of multiple geographic and environmental factors on population connectivity. A temperature gradient runs roughly North-South, while a precipitation gradient runs from arid regions in the Southwest to wetter regions in the Northeast. An ecotone largely tracks the precipitation gradient, transitioning from desert in the Southwest to grassland (high meadow and steppe) in the central plateau and forest in the Northeast, with pockets of shrublands and sandy lands in the Southeast. Here, we evaluated population genetic divergence of C. microphylla across its entire geographic range on the Inner Mongolia Plateau, using a set of 22 polymorphic microsatellite markers, four cpDNA sequences and 5788 SNPs generated through genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The major goals of this study were (i) to characterize genetic variation and population structure in C. microphylla, and (ii) to quantify the relative contributions of geographic factors (IBD) and environmental clines (IBE) to genetic differentiation in this important restoration species.\nWe collected samples from 221 individuals of C. microphylla at ten sites throughout the natural distribution of the species in the southern Inner Mongolia Plateau of China (SZW, ZXB, DL, XH, and QYH), central Inner Mongolia Plateau (XU and DU), and northeastern Inner Mongolia Plateau (EWK, CB, XBY) (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Fig. 1). Together, these sites cover a wide range of climate space, giving us good power to detect environmentally-driven spatial genetic variation (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Sample sizes ranged from N = 18 to 24, with a mean of N = 22 (Additional file 1: Table S1). Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaf tissues using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).\nWe genotyped all samples at 22 microsatellite (simple sequence repeat; SSR) markers (Additional file 1: Table S2) that were developed by Han  using the method described by Lian et al.  (Additional file 1: Table S2). PCR amplification was conducted in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL including 40 ng DNA, 1 \u00d7 buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 \u03bcM dNTPs, 0.6 \u03bcM forward primer and reverse primer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). The forward primers were tagged with a fluorescent 6-FAM or HEX label to produce flourescent-labeled PCR amplified fragments. PCR was performed on a Mastercyler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the following procedure: 10 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 10 touchdown cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 60 s at 65 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0C per cycle), and 60 s at 72 \u00b0C, then 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 60 s at 55 \u00b0C, and 60 s at 72 \u00b0C, and a 10 min final extension step at 72 \u00b0C. An ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to capture amplified products by a fluorescence detection system for SSR markers. Fragment sizes were determined using an internal size standard (LIZ500, ABI, USA), and the output was analyzed using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems).\nFour cpDNA regions, including trnL-trnF, psbA-trnH, psbB-psbH and trnG, were amplified for all 221 individuals. The primers and methodology for amplification of these four DNA regions via PCR were described in Taberlet et al. , Demesure et al. , Hamilton , and Shaw et al. , respectively. Sequences were generated with an ABI 3730XL DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems), and edited, assembled and aligned in Geneious (v7.1.7, http://www.geneious.com/). All cpDNA sequences were deposited in Genbank (accession numbers KU564257 to KU564268).\nA total of 127 samples from ten populations were used to generate the genotyping by sequencing dataset (GBSseq; Additional file 1: Table S1). Individual DNA libraries for each of these samples were prepared using the restriction enzyme ApeKI according to the protocol in Elshire et al. . Libraries were then sequenced using paired-end sequencing across 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq 4000 (BGI, Shengzhen, China). The quality of the raw read data was examined using FASTQC . GBS data assembly, mapping, and SNP discovery were performed using Stacks v1.23 . In the absence of a reference genome for this species, RADSeq loci were assembled de novo using the \u2018denovo_map.pl\u2019 pipeline in STACKS. We used a parameter combination recommended by Mastretta-Yanes et al. : minimum read depth to create a stack (\u2212m) = 3, number of mismatches allowed between loci within individuals (\u2212M) = 2, and number of mismatches allowed between loci within each catalogue (\u2212n) = 2. All other parameters were kept at default values. Those loci present in at least 80% of individuals at each site were retained in the final dataset, and loci with minor allele frequencies lower than 0.05 were removed. GBS genotyping of the samples from population SZW resulted in significant missing data, so this population was removed from the GBS dataset. GBS-seq raw data were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with reference number SRP071628.\nAll 22 microsatellite loci were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We calculated common metrics of genetic variation, including average number of alleles (Na), observed and expected heterozygosity (Ho and He), and global and pairwise FST. Both global and pairwise FST were tested for significance based on 9999 permutations. All calculations and statistical tests were conducted using GenAlEx v6.5 .\nWe used the software STRUCTURE to infer the probability of assignment to distinct genetic clusters for all 221 individuals in the ten sampled populations . The analysis was performed using the admixture model and with the option of correlated allele frequencies between populations. Ten runs were conducted for each value for the number of genetic clusters (K), with K ranging from 1 to 10. The length of the burn-in for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) replications was set to 10,000, and data were collected every 1000 steps over a total length 100,000 MCMC steps in each run. We identified the optimal value of K using the method developed by Evanno et al.  as implemented in the software Structure Harvester .\nChloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences were edited and assembled using SeqMan software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Multiple alignments of the DNA sequences were performed with Clustal X , with subsequent adjustment in Bioedit . Haplotype (Hd) and nucleotide (\u03c0) diversities were calculated from aligned DNA sequences using DnaSP v5 . We conducted an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and tested for significance based on 1023 permutations in Arlequin v3.0 . A haplotype distribution map was constructed using ArcMap v9.3 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, California, USA), and a haplotype network was constructed in NETWORK v4.678  using Medicago sativa as an outgroup.\nObserved and expected heterozygosities (Ho and He) were calculated using the package Adegenet v2.0.1.  in R (www.r-project.org). Both global and pairwise FST were calculated and tested for significance based on 9999 permutations using Genepop v4.0 . As with the microsatellite dataset, we also performed STRUCTURE analysis  on our GBS dataset, using the admixture model and the same MCMC parameters as before.\nWe used climate-based ecological niche models (ENMs) at multiple time periods to investigate whether current and past climate suitability is a relevant factor shaping observed patterns of genetic differentiation among populations of C. microphylla. Ecological niche modelling was carried out in MAXENT v3.3.3 . A total of 53 occurrence points, obtained from the literature [13\u201316] and our own sampling, and 19 GIS data layers at 2.5 arc min resolution for present-day bioclimatic variables, obtained from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org), were included in the analysis (Additional file 1: Table S3).\nTo estimate the distribution of C. microphylla at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), we projected the model obtained by our present-day species-climate analysis onto the LGM using data layers for past climate constructed under the commonly used Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC v3.2)  scaled down to a 2.5 arc min resolution and obtained from WorldClim. To model the suitability of C. microphylla under a future climate scenario, we acquired data layers (2.5 arc min resolution) predicted for the year 2080 under, again, the commonly used general circulation model MIROC from WorldClim. As with the LGM scenario, we projected the present-day ENM onto the future climate layers to explore how the predicted distribution of C. microphylla may be affected by ongoing global climate change. The performance of the model prediction was evaluated using the area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) calculated by MAXENT. Model predictions were visualized in ARCMAP v9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA).\nTo investigate the roles of geographic and environmental factors in spatial genetic differentiation, we tested for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) using all three marker types collected in our study. In all analyses, population pairwise genetic distances were represented by matrices of pairwise FST / (1-FST) as recommended by Rousset . Geographic distances were represented by the logarithms (log10) of geographic distances between all pairs of populations. For the environmental predictors, we downloaded the 19 bioclimate variables from the WorldClim database (www.worldclim.org) at 0.5 arc min resolution and then reduced covariance by performing spatial principal component analysis (PCA) analysis on the raster layers using the R package \u2018RStoolbox\u2019 . We retained the first three PC rasters that resulted from this analysis and extracted the value of the data point on each raster at each of the coordinates for our sampled populations. To quantify IBD and IBE, we performed multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) using the R function \u2018MMRR\u2019 . We also tested for covariance between geographic and environmental distances with a Mantel test using the R package \u2018vegan\u2019 . In each analysis, 10,000 permutations were used to generate a null distribution for significance testing.\nTo further evaluate IBD and IBE, we also performed a complementary analysis, generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). GDM is a statistical technique that uses nonlinear matrix regression to model spatial patterns of biological dissimilarity, including genetic distance, between sampling sites against differences in geographic and environmental variables . GDM uses an I-spline turnover function for each predictor variable to quantify: (1) variation in the rate of genetic turnover along each environmental and geographic axis (the shape of each spline) while controlling for all other variables, and (2) the curvilinear relationships between genetic distance and geographic and environmental distances [46, 47]. The maximum height of each spline corresponds to the relative importance of the associated predictor .\nGenetic distances for each model were the same FST / (1-FST) matrices used in the MMRR analysis, and geographic distances were based on the geographic coordinates of each sampling site. For the environmental predictors, we used the same three PC rasters as in the MMRR analysis. After fitting the GDM model to these data, we visualized spatial patterns of genetic turnover by projecting the GDM model onto the PC rasters. This assigns a color value to each cell on the raster based on its predicted genetic composition, and greater differences in the colors between cells indicate greater predicted genetic differences. All of the GDM analyses were performed in the R package \u2018gdm\u2019 .\nTwenty-two microsatellite markers were used to evaluate genetic diversity across 221 individuals of 10 populations of C. microphylla (Table 1). The mean number of alleles per locus (Na) ranged from 5.318 in population XBY to 8.091 in population DU (Table 1). Mean observed heterozygosity per population (Ho) ranged from 0.416 in CB to 0.693 in QYH, and mean expected heterozygosity (He) values ranged from 0.490 in XBY to 0.708 in DU. We did not detect significant deviations from HWE in any of the 22 loci.\nA total of 11 different cpDNA haplotypes (H1-H11) were identified based on 7 polymorphic sites detected in four cpDNA sequences (Table 1). Haplotypes H1 and H2 were the two most common haplotypes, found in 70% and 50% of C. microphylla populations, respectively (Fig. 1b). Haplotypes H3, H6, and H10, on the other hand, were found in only one population each (Fig. 1b). Haplotypes H8 and H4 were identified as the most ancestral and youngest haplotypes, respectively. The populations ETW, CB, and XBY had the lowest haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) with only one haplotype (H8) observed in each population. The highest diversity was observed in population SZW (Hd = 0.771 and \u03c0 = 0.47; Table 1).\nOverall, 5788 SNPs from our GBS reads were retained for 106 individuals from 9 populations after quality control and filtering steps. Mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) per population ranged from 0.196 in CB to 0.303 in XH, and mean expected heterozygosity (He) values ranged from 0.247in CB to 0.308 in XH (Table 1).\nGlobal FST among all 10 sampling sites based on our microsatellite dataset was 0.115. The pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation (FST) across all 10 populations ranged from 0.017 (ZXB vs. XH) to 0.139 (XBY vs. QYH) (Additional file 1: Table S4). All C. microphylla population pairs were significantly differentiated from each other except for the ZXB and XH pair, for which FST was not significantly different from zero. Comparisons between regions revealed little structure between the central (DU and XU) and northeast (CB, EWK, and XBY) populations (mean FST = 0.071) nor between the central and southwest (QYH, SZW, DL, XH, and ZXB) populations (mean FST = 0.073), but did reveal higher differentiation between the northeast and the southwest populations (mean FST = 0.138). The population XBY showed the highest degree of genetic differentiation from other populations (mean FST = 0.171), followed by populations CB (mean FST = 0.168) and EWK (mean FST = 0.138).\nFor cpDNA, global FST among all sites was 0.360. About 76% of pairwise FST estimates among C. microphylla population pairs were statistically significant (Additional file 1: Table S5). Pairwise comparisons between regions revealed similar patterns compared to the microsatellite results. The mean genetic differentiation between northeast and southwest populations was FST = 0.64, followed by southwest vs. central populations (mean FST = 0.48), and northeast vs. central populations (mean FST = 0.17).\nFor our GBS dataset of 5788 SNPs, global FST among the nine sampling sites retained in this dataset was 0.246. Pairwise comparisons between regions revealed similar patterns compared to the microsatellite and cpDNA results (Additional file 1: Table S6). The mean genetic differentiation estimates between southwest vs. central populations and northeast vs. central populations were FST = 0.164 and FST = 0.168, respectively. Whereas, the mean genetic differentiation between northeast and southwest populations was FST = 0.350.\nSTRUCTURE analyses performed on both our microsatellite and GBS datasets indicated that the best supported number of clusters was K = 2, according to the \u0394K methods for identifying the optimal number of clusters (Additional file 1: Figure S2). The probability of membership to either of the two clusters (A and B) was geographically structured among populations and regions (Figs. 1, 2). Specifically, the membership proportions in the STRUCTURE analysis revealed a significant geographic pattern in which individuals in populations mostly associated with cluster A (i.e. SZW, ZXB, XH, DL, and QYH) were more common in the southwest of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (41\u00b0N - 42\u00b0N; Fig. 1a, 2a), while individuals in populations mostly associated with cluster B (i.e. EWK, CB, and XBY) were found in the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (48\u00b0N- 49\u00b0N; Fig. 1a, 2a). In the central region of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (44\u00b0N - 45\u00b0N), two populations (XU and DU) showed intermediate probabilities of assignment to either cluster, based on the microsatellite dataset (Fig. 1a, 2a). This could result from potential admixture, shared ancestry, or demographic factors. Of the two central populations, although the XU population is more southerly, it shared genetic cluster assignments (35.6% in cluster A and 64.4% in cluster B) more with the populations in the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Plateau than with those in the southwest. The DU population, on the other hand, showed more similar genetic assignments (72.3% in cluster A and 27.7% in cluster B) to the populations in the southwest of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, even though it is geographically closer to the northeast populations (Fig. 1a, 2a). In contrast, the assignment probabilities for individuals in these populations based on the GBS dataset (Fig. 1c, 2b) were much more closely aligned with cluster A (the southwest populations) compared to those based on the microsatellite data (Fig. 1a vs. 1c; Fig. 2a vs. 2b).\nThree climate-based ecological niche models were constructed using 19 bioclimatic variables for three time periods: present day, the last glacial maximum (LGM), and the future (year 2080) (Fig. 3). The model based on present-day data showed strong support based on the receiver operating curve (AUC > 0.95), suggesting good model fit to the underlying data. The present-day predicted distribution of C. microphylla is consistent with its presently observed distribution (Fig. 3b). In total, precipitation had a greater influence on C. microphylla than temperature, as indicated by jackknife resampling of the regularized training gain (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Compared with its current distribution, the estimated distribution of C. microphylla during the LGM was much smaller, based on projection of the present-day model onto past climate layers, suggesting that a significant expansion occurred after the LGM from the southwest to the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (Fig. 3a). The ENM projected onto the future climate scenario for 2080 suggests that climate change will result in a significant reduction of the species\u2019 potential range (Fig. 3c), resulting in a retraction to a small zone of climatically suitable habitat in the southwest-central part of C. microphylla\u2019s current distribution.\nThe spatial PCA that we performed on the 19 bioclimate data layers returned three PC rasters that explained >85% of the total bioclimatic variation. Factors loadings showed that PC1 was primarily described by temperature variables (Bio1\u201311; www.worldclim.org), while PC2 was derived from precipitation variables (Bio12\u201319; www.worldclim.org). PC3 was driven by three variables \u2013 precipitation seasonality (Bio15), mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2), and temperature annual range (Bio7) \u2013 and therefore represents an environmental seasonality and range of variation axis.\nMultiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) analysis suggested that genetic differentiation showed a significant pattern of both IBE and IBD for all three molecular datasets (Table 2 and Fig. 4). For each of the microsatellite, cpDNA, and GBS datasets, the model was a significant fit to the data (p < 0.001for each; Table 2), and explained a large proportion of the total variance (R2 = 0.685, R2 = 0.696, R2 = 888, respectively; Table 2). The signal of IBE in each dataset was driven by PC1 (temperature variables), which had a significant association with genetic distances in all three cases (p < 0.01 for each model; Table 2). PC2 and PC3 did not have significant correlations with genetic distances for any of the three molecular markers (p > 0.05; Table 2). IBE was slightly stronger than IBD in the cpDNA (IBE = 0.515, IBD = 0.361) and GBS datasets (IBE = 0.564, IBD = 0.444) and was considerably stronger than IBD in the microsatellite dataset (IBE = 0.702, IBD = 0.260; Table 2). Geographic distances were moderately correlated with distances in PC1 (Mantel\u2019s r = 0.685, p = 0.001) and PC3 (Mantel\u2019s r = 0702, p = 0.002) but showed no correlation with PC2 (Mantel\u2019s r = 0.044, p = 0.553).\nGeneralized dissimilarity modelling (GDM; Ferrier et al. 2007) analysis also revealed significant patterns of IBE and IBD in all three of our molecular datasets (Table 3). Overall, the models were a significant fit to the data (p < 0.01 for each model) and explained a large proportion of the deviance in the data structure, with 77.95% of deviance explained for the microsatellite dataset, 74.81% of deviance explained for the cpDNA dataset, and 89.18% of deviance explained for the GBS dataset. Deviance explained values for non-linear models are analogous to R2 values for linear models. Concordant with the results of the MMRR analysis, GDM revealed significant associations between genetic distances and PC3 distances for each dataset (p < 0.05; Table 3). IBE was stronger than IBD in the microsatellite dataset (IBE = 0.561, IBD = 0.132; Table 3) but slightly weaker than IBD in the cpDNA (IBE = 0.473, IBD = 0.627; Table 3) and GBS (IBE = 0.622, IBD = 0.717; Table 3) datasets. In general, maps of spatial turnover in genetic composition generated by GDM show similar patterns for the microsatellite and GBS datasets (Fig. 5).\nChina\u2019s Inner Mongolia Plateau contains dramatic clines in several bioclimatic variables that are critical for plant growth and community assembly and also exhibits spatial heterogeneity in various soil properties and characteristics , making it an excellent landscape on which to examine the geographic and environmental drivers of population genetic structure. This region contains high elevation arid steppe and sandy soils ecosystems that are traditionally understudied in landscape genetics and phylogeography. The need to better understand population dynamics in key species in these ecosystems is pressing because the entire region is heavily threatened by soil erosion, desertification, and ongoing climate change .\nIn this study, we utilized large genomic datasets, including 22 microsatellites, cpDNA sequences from four gene regions, and 5788 SNPs, to characterize patterns of range-wide genetic differentiation across biophysical clines in C. microphylla, an important species for ecological restoration efforts, on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. We found that genetic diversity (haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity, average number of alleles, and heterozygosity) was distributed across the range of the species, with more centrally located populations typically showing higher levels of genetic diversity than populations nearer to range edges, particularly to the northern range edge of this species (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This spatial pattern of genetic diversity is fairly common in many different and diverse taxa . While genetic variation can have many other spatial distributions, this \u201cabundant center hypothesis,\u201d in which central populations harbor greater diversity appears to be one scenario that is observed fairly frequently [51, 52]. Under any scenario, better understanding the spatial distribution of genetic variation is central to developing improved management plans for maintaining genetic diversity and for predicting the impacts of potential threats to genetic diversity .\nThe exceptions to this general pattern in our study system were found in the southern populations that we sampled. Several of these populations (e.g. DL, SZQ, XH, and ZXB) harbored among the highest levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity (based on our cpDNA dataset), allelic diversity (based on our microsatellite dataset), and observed heterozygosity (based on our microsatellite and GBS datasets; Table 1 and Fig. 1). This pattern may be explained by the historical distribution of C. microphylla. When the ecological niche model that we constructed was projected onto past climate layers from the last glacial maximum (LGM), it suggested that suitable habitat for C. microphylla was much more limited, compared to present day, and was primarily restricted to an area in the southwest corner of C. microphylla\u2019s current range. This suggests that a northward expansion following glacial retreat after the LGM allowed C. microphylla to achieve the distribution it has today. Glacial refugia often harbor greater genetic diversity, particularly in plants [53\u201355], and that appears to be the case here as well, demonstrating how biogeographic histories can influence patterns of genetic diversity observed today.\nTo investigate how contemporary landscape factors affect patterns of genetic variation in C. microphylla, we conducted a landscape genetic analysis in which we employed complimentary linear and non-linear matrix regression analyses to quantify patterns of IBD and IBE. Multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR)  and generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM)  revealed strong evidence that both geographic and environmental factors play important roles in structuring genetic variation in this system. Overall, the results of our MMRR and GDM analyses were highly concordant, but there were some minor differences (Tables 2, 3). Some of these differences are likely due to the linear vs. non-linear regressions used in MMRR and GDM, respectively [44, 46]. Whether the observed differences result from GDM over-fitting the model or MMRR under-fitting the model is not currently known. In any case, our results can be viewed as strong evidence that IBD and IBE are both significant patterns of genetic differentiation in C. microphylla, even if their precise strengths are uncertain, and therefore geographic and environmental factors are both important contributors to the genetic structuring of populations in this system.\nThere were also slight differences among our three genetic datasets. If we average the results for the MMRR and GDM analyses, we find that IBE played a considerably stronger role than IBD in structuring genetic variation in the microsatellite data (\u03b2IBE = 0.196 vs. \u03b2IBD = 0.631), but IBE and IBD were much more balanced in the cpDNA (\u03b2IBE = 0.494 vs. \u03b2IBD = 0.494) and GBS datasets (\u03b2IBE = 0.581 vs \u03b2IBD = 0.593). There is no clear reason why microsatellite markers would be expected to have lower IBD than cpDNA or GBS markers. There is an interesting possibility that chloroplast DNA, which is uni-parentally inherited through seeds, could show a different spatial pattern from nuclear DNA, which is bi-parentally inherited through seeds and pollen, if dispersal in seeds and pollen are subject to different controls. For instance, if different animals disperse seeds and pollen, which is commonly the case, or if pollen is wind dispersed while seeds fall onto the underlying terrain, then we would expect that patterns of spatial genetic variation in cpDNA and nuclear DNA could be very different . For C. microphylla, which has pollen dispersed by wind and insect pollinators , we would expect that nDNA markers would show a greater signal of IBE compared to IBD, because geographic factors would be much more limiting for seed dispersal. In fact, we do see that IBE is slightly higher than IBD for our nuclear microsatellite and GBS datasets, while IBE and IBD are very similar in our cpDNA dataset, but this difference is fairly subtle.\nThe GDM and MMRR analyses both detected a significant signal that variation between populations in environmental PC1 drives the pattern of IBE. This signal was highly significant (p \u2264 0.02) and explained a large proportion of genetic variation (\u03b2 = 0.383 to 0.565) in all three of our genetic datasets in the results of both MMRR and GDM analysis (Tables 2, 3). Signals for PC2 and PC3 were not significant in any dataset under either analysis. PC1 captured variation in the bioclimatic temperature variables in our environmental GIS dataset. Hence, our results suggest that IBE in C. microphylla is primarily driven by differences in temperature variables between populations. Both phenology and leaf emergence are linked to temperature cues in C. microphylla [57, 58]. Flowering period in C. microphylla lasts less than 30 days, and shifts in flowering period occur under different experimental temperature treatments . This suggests that differences in temperature regimes between populations may cause differences in phenology which lead to reduced overlap in flowering period and, therefore, reduced gene flow. This pattern of reduced overlap in reproductive timing has been referred to as \u2018isolation by time\u2019  and may be a key factor driving genetic structure in this system.\nThus, overall, our study presents a strong case for a role of both historic and contemporary factors, including both geographic and environmental variables, in generating the currently observed patterns of spatial genetic variation in C. microphylla. For plants involved in ecological restoration, like C. microphylla, understanding these patterns is critical, because restoration work inherently involves moving plants between areas (even if they are geographically close). For instance, in this system, populations exhibit genetic differentiation between environments with different temperature regimes, and therefore restoration efforts should focus on transplanting between areas with similar environmental conditions. Plants adapted to different thermal climates may flower at the wrong time or out of sync with the local population, reducing the effectiveness of transplant efforts. Because C. microphylla also show geographically driven genetic differentiation, plants that are transplanted from distant sites that are environmentally similar could be effective at introducing genetic variation into struggling populations . Hence, better understanding the factors that shape genetic variation in these species is critical for preventing unintended consequences of reintroductions and translocations and for guiding conservation plans to produce the best possible outcomes. Specifically, the knowledge generated by studies like ours can contribute to managing how genetic variation is distributed in these species, the probability of individuals surviving and becoming established under various climatic factors, and the chances of maintaining genetically healthy populations.\nWe thank Prof. Tieliang Shang Guan, Shanxi University, for the sampling and identification of the plant material and the UC Berkeley Geospatial Innovation Facility for providing GIS software.\nThis research was funded by a grant from the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP-IAS10) of China.
