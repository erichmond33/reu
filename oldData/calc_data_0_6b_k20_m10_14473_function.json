    "text": "UNStudio has joined forces with HPP Architects to create a consortium (UNS + HPP) to carry out the next phases of their winning project at the architectural design competition for FOUR Frankfurt. Take a look at the complete story after the jump.\nFrom the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Gro\u00df & Partner real estate development company \u2013 who will be carrying out the development of the project \u2013 back in 2015. Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years. Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt\u2019s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground. The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation.\nThe choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt\u2019s shopping district to the east of Ro\u00dfmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage. With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents.\nThe new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstra\u00dfe into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site.\nAccording to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value. The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages. The existing block on the Junghofstra\u00dfe will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels.\nFour Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023.",

The rally was also held in the last year with the same objectives. Goals of the rally are to criticize Jogye Order for its responsibility on Dongguk University\u2019s present conflicts related to President Han Tae-sik (Bogwang) and to guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy from the order.\nAt 11:00 A.M., approximately 200 people, about 150 Donggukians and 50 people who are related to Dongguk University, gathered together in Manhae Hall. As soon as the march began, the marchers were obstructed by police officers because of a cow, which was prepared by the GSC, was not reported to participate in the rally. Scuffles broke out between the police and the GSC, and the cow was not able to go with the marchers. The parade was started from Chungmu-ro where Dongguk University is located, passed Myeong-dong and finally to Jogyesa Temple.\nAfter several speeches from students, the GSC and the gathered students tried to deliver request proposal to Jogye Order together, but police officers blocked the way. Therefore, only ten representatives were allowed to go to deliver the request proposal to the persons concerned of the Jogye Order at the temple gate. The request proposal involves following three demands: Jogye Order has to stop intervening in the school matters and should guarantee the school\u2019s autonomy, every sunim who spoiled the school needs to apologize and resign, and board of directors should be reformed in a more democratic way.",

I have to do it for sure as my * is little thick.\n21 While some of what happens on a date is guided by an understanding of basic, unspoken rules, there is considerable room to experiment, and there are numerous sources of advice available. In fact, the smarter you are, the more clueless you will be, and the more problems you&apos;re going to have in your dating life. According to a 2007 Centers of Disease Control (CDC) report, approximately 72 percent of 8th and 9th graders report that they are \"dating.\" a b c Sharon Jayson. \"Should I follow any rules?\". \"Can you be beautiful but not superficial?\". 138 Iran has a large population of young people with sixty percent of the 70-million population being under the age of thirty.",

Last updated by Raam Dev 4 years, 11 months ago.\nI need a solution for a site I\u2019m developing with S2 Members Pro, the issue is the clients run a chain of shops across the UK and a magazine that is subscribed from all over the world. The client wants its clients to be able to not only sign up online but also in store, the problem is my client will not accept the 0.01p charge on the checkout with a 100% discount code, this is because they feel there customers will not like having to pay online.\nI know you suggest 2 options on the plugin: 1 being a free registration form but this is open to abuse if the link gets leaked and will also require a lot of moderation on the admin side of things to make sure each sign up actually did join in store. 2 being a free trial, we can set the trial up to last a year but then the checkout will still require a form of payment to start running once the trial period has ended.\nIs there any solution to this problem? we need it to be as secure as it can without being open to abuse and easy to administrate.\nWhat is the best solution for this?\nLet us know if that answers your question.",

This fauna comprises giants akin to the ca. 12 m lengthy caiman Purussaurus, but additionally a diversified fish fauna and fragile molluscs, while fossil pollen and spores shape relics of ancestral swamps and rainforests.\nWith exceptional wit, readability, and intelligence, Richard Dawkins, one of many world&apos;s most famed evolutionary biologists, has brought numerous readers to the wonders of technological know-how in works equivalent to The egocentric Gene. Now, within the Ancestor&apos;s story, Dawkins deals a masterwork: an exciting opposite journey via evolution, from present-day people again to the microbial beginnings of lifestyles 4 billion years in the past.\nColonial dwelling is characterised through department of work and finely coordinated association; besides the fact that, many occasions inside of a colony are the results of conflicts among participants trying to maximize their very own pursuits. This interaction of cooperation and clash has raised many questions in evolutionary biology, in particular how cooperative habit is maintained within the absence of direct replica through staff.\nTo this point, the dominant paradigms by which glossy scientists have seen nature were established essentially round Newtonian and Darwinian methods. As theoretical ecologist Robert E. Ulanowicz observes in his new paintings, a 3rd Window, neither of those types is enough for explaining how actual change\u2014in the shape of inventive increase or emergence\u2014takes position in nature.\nEcology is in a hard kingdom as a systematic self-discipline. whereas a few theoretical ecologists try to construct a definition of ecology from first rules, many others are wondering even the feasibility of a normal and common thought. even as, it really is more and more vital that ecology is safely and functionally outlined for a iteration of researchers tackling escalating environmental difficulties within the face of doubt and war of words.\nSee Chapter 15). , Chapter 16. (9) Middle Miocene Honda Group (La Venta Fauna), Magdalena Valley. , Chapter 16). Map made by D. Riff and J. van Arkel. et al. argue that in the past 30 Ma well-documented episodes of marine influence in Amazonia are limited to the Miocene. However, there is no evidence for fully established marine corridors (\u2018seaways\u2019) throughout the South American continent in the Cenozoic. ). Megafans are low-gradient river systems choked by sediments, which force them to continuously change their courses.\n2004): 11 30 20 10 0 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 Age (Ma) 3500 Fig. 2 Histograms for U-Pb ages for 369 grains of detrital zircon collected from the mouth of the Amazon River outlet show peaks in the Archean, Trans-Amazonian and Grenvillian intervals. Pb-Pb ages give similar results. The error bars correspond to 1\u03c3. (After Rino et al. B. F. de Roever are based on Rb-Sr isochrons, which are now no longer thought to reflect the age of crystallization. Santos et al.

    "text": "\"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one,\" David Montgomery said.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nIt\u2019s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson. But for now, his goal is to prove what he already believes is true: that he is the top receiver in this draft.",

Jake Guenther and Alex Isola singled to open the inning. A wild pitch had both runners in scoring position and Johnny Rizer delivered a two-run single up the middle to make it a 6-2 ballgame. The Frogs didn\u2019t go quietly, scoring a run on a Zach Humphreys groundout in the eighth. With two outs in the ninth, the Frogs put the tying run on base with walks to Josh Watson and Isola around a Guenther base hit. UTA closer Andrew Gross wiggled off the hook with a ground out to end the game. Jared Janczak (0-2) tossed 4 1/3 innings. He allowed six runs (two earned) on six hits, walked one and struck out two. Haylen Green and Matt Rudis allowed one combined runner over the last 3 2/3 innings of the game. The pair fanned seven.\nThe defensive end position is loaded, name-wise, but not very experienced.\nThis is a spot with a ton of turnover and, in turn, opportunities for new faces. Mathis, who some have compared to Jerry Hughes when it comes to potential, appears to be on his way to a starting role after continuing to earn rave reviews through spring. Patterson hinted that 2019 could finally be Bowen\u2019s time too, so don\u2019t take your eyes off the 6-foot-4 Byron Nelson High School product when fall camp arrives down the stretch.\nThe cornerback would fill a massive need with Jeff Gladney and Julius Lewis set to graduate.\nJenkins is getting recruited by Jeremy Modkins mostly because he\u2019s the cornerbacks coach for the Frogs. However, Jenkins says he\u2019s built a strong relationship with each of the coaches on staff.\nJenkins was hosted on his visit by redshirt freshman Atanza Vongor. The four-star says he got along with the defensive back as well as the rest of the team.\nEquestrian has put together a solid season.\nTCU News: Joe Broadnax\u2019s career is over, will Justin Rogers play this year?",

    "text": "Grace. What is it? What does it mean? How do you get it and how do you KNOW you got it?\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I have no way of describing something I don\u2019t understand BUT believe deeply in my soul that it exists. How do you get these graces? Sanctifying grace is IN your soul. It\u2019s the free and underserved gift from God. Actual grace would come from our knowledge and belief of all things right and wrong \u2013 following the Ten Commandments, making sure we follow a path that is pure and justified. Justified means to be sinless, and to be sinless means you are in favor with God. When you are baptized you are sinless and therefore have favor with God. When you go to reconciliation, you are once again sinless and in favor with God. You are in a state of grace. Once sanctifying grace is in your soul, you can increase it by every good action you do \u2013 receiving Communion, saying prayers, performing corporal works of Mercy. The most important thing to think about is NOT what you are going to do or how you are going to do it but to recognize God\u2019s love. The reason you can do any good work is because God LOVES YOU FIRST in Grace. You must continually seek God\u2019s grace, continually respond to the actual graces God is working within you, inclining you to turn to Him and do good.\nHave I answered the question as to what Grace is? I\u2019ve read through all the study guides provided to me and compiled all the information, but I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve properly explained what Grace is.\nTo me Grace is a feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s butterflies in the stomach, and it takes my breath away. I feel this way every time I think of my husband. We met and married 38 years ago. I see God\u2019s grace in our meeting, getting married, and living our life together as husband and wife. Sometimes it\u2019s a jolt, like an electric shock and then an overwhelming wave of love, like the enormous amount of love I felt when I held my first baby in my arms for the first time. This happened again with my 2nd and 3rd child, and then God blessed us with twins to make 4 and 5. Then sometimes it feels like a raging fight going on inside me, making hard decisions that breaks my heart in two. I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray. Mostly it\u2019s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me \u201cGrandma\u201d. I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.\nWhere does Grace come from?",

    "text": "Everyone seems to want a brighter smile, and teeth whitening is a great option for boosting your confidence. If food and drinks have stained your pearly whites, you may be tempted to rush to the drug store and pick up the first over-the-counter whitening product you find. However, while side effects from whitening products are rare, you should follow these tips before bleaching your teeth to ensure your safety.\nIf your teeth appear stained, don\u2019t assume you need to bleach them. It\u2019s possible a good teeth cleaning will restore the sparkle to your smile. During an oral exam, your dentist will also check for cavities and gum issues, which should be treated before bleaching your teeth.\nAt-home whiteners most often use carbamide peroxide in concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent. Carbamide peroxide is hydrogen peroxide with urea added. This product remains active for up to 10 hours at a low enough acidity level that enamel etching is not a concern.\nStart with a product containing 10 percent carbamide peroxide. If the whitener doesn\u2019t bother your mouth, but you don\u2019t see the results you want, try another over-the-counter product with a higher concentration.\nWhen you choose an at-home teeth bleaching kit, it\u2019s your responsibility to follow the instructions on the package. Don\u2019t leave the gel or strips on your teeth longer than advised or you could experience tooth sensitivity and sore gums. Also, avoid drinking soda, sports drinks or other sugary/acidic beverages for several hours after whitening to prevent etching your teeth.\nAt-home whitening kits are inexpensive and widely available, but that doesn\u2019t make them the best choice. Professional in-office teeth bleaching can lighten your smile up to eight shades in a single 45-minute visit. Combined with professional-grade take-home treatments, patients see an average improvement of 11 shades. In comparison, over-the-counter whitening requires daily 30-minute applications for more than two weeks to achieve a six-shade improvement.\nIn-office whitening uses LED light-activated technology to maximize results in the shortest amount of time without causing tooth sensitivity. It\u2019s effective both for people who simply want to lighten their smile and for patients with severely discolored teeth.\nPregnant women and nursing mothers should postpone teeth bleaching.\nTranslucent teeth don\u2019t respond well to whitening. A tooth-colored composite placed on the lingual side of a see-through tooth is a more effective way to improve its appearance.\nZen Dental Center in Seattle offers Philips Zoom in-office teeth bleaching for safe, professional results.

    "text": "Constant development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) technologies results in evolving aircraft, instrumentation, and control programs of these systems. An open source simulator was examined as a potential method of testing UAS platforms changes. The open source simulator was used to simulate flights flown by an actual platform. Existing flight data was used as a base line of comparison for the telemetry data of the simulated flight. Patterns in parameters such as vehicle attitude and throttle output were compared between the simulated and actual results to determine if the simulator produced an accurate representation of a physical flight. Analysis of the simulated vehicle exhibited similar behavior to that of the actual vehicle in most of the flight data collected. Simplification in the flight simulator model may be responsible for the deviations in magnitude observed between the two sets of data. Three points of interest in each of the three test cases were chosen as checks for the values in the data. These points in the flight were studied in the various graphs of the parameters graphed and the difference between the simulated and actual values was calculated. The values at these points stayed within an average of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for vehicle attitude and between 0% and 33.3% throttle difference over the three test cases. The average difference in attitude was 5.1\u00b0 over 93 compared values and 8.1% in throttle over 18 compared values. On average the simulator showed good agreement to existing flight data and therefore will be a good tool to simulate flights prior to a mission. The accuracy of the results may be improved with further development of the simulation model.\nRamirez Duarte, Jaime A.

The exhibition showed us the way to do business right and to do it effectively and efficiently. The exhibition also made room for us to meet various investors, who have tremendously been of help to the growth of Hyst Global Business Ltd.\nI exhibited at the African Food and Products Exhibition 2018. The Event was a wonderful one and an eye-opener for not just me but for other exhibitors and attendees. From the conference sessions, I acquired knowledge on exportation of goods. The AFPE 2018 was the door opener to my exquisite Zobo Business. I thought to myself that since the Exhibition was for African Food and Products, Zobo is an African drink so I decided to make and sell for the Exhibition. Just like magic, amidst my other products, the zobo made super sales. Now I have a branded Zobo drink.\nThe AFPE 2018 was great, it was an opportunity to have a firsthand understanding of the challenges facing SMEs, helping us know what products they needed and how they can take advantage of our service offerings. The AFPE 2019 gave us a chance to partner with many of them.\nIt was an amazing experience, my business was a month old and I didn\u2019t know anyone. It was the first time I got to be in public and I appreciate the opportunity to be exposed. Coming to the exhibition boosted my sales and created awareness for me when people didn\u2019t know me. I have got contacts from the exhibition and they have formed part of my customer base.\nLagos is a commercial hub and it was important for us to share with the market. There has always been a great need to take our products and services to our end users, offering them values and benefits and we achieved that at the African Food & Products Exhibition 2018.",

    "text": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon.",

    "text": "Mahatma Gandhi1 once said, \u201cThe world provides enough for every man\u2019s need but not for every man\u2019s greed.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s easy to agree with proclamations of world peace and say things like, \u201cThe rich should really give to the poor and solve world hunger!\u201d However, when the giving strikes closer to home, it can be tougher than we think.\nI once had a watch that I thought was seriously cool. It was a boy\u2019s watch, but I didn\u2019t mind; it had all the dials and gadgets you could want. I visited my family and my younger brother was crazy about my watch and asked if he could have it. I told him I couldn\u2019t possibly part with such amazingness and sadly left it at that. Shortly after getting home, my treasured watch met with an accident and broke. It was then that I realized how stupid it was that I\u2019d missed the opportunity to give it to my little brother, who was so much more important to me than that watch ever could be. It might not have lasted him forever either, but at least he would have been happy for a while. And more than the watch, the meaning behind my giving him something special would have stuck with him so much longer.\nI try to remember that incident whenever I\u2019m tempted to be selfish with my things or start to prize them too highly. It\u2019s great to have nice things and groovy gadgets. (Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m fairly addicted to my phone, which contains all my appointments, mail, reminders, to-do lists, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, Google, and favorite games.) These days, the \u201cmust-have\u201d gadgets are endless\u2014from smartphones, iPads, laptops, and gaming equipment right down to 3D home TVs! If you\u2019re able to have some of these nice things and enjoy them and they help you with your work and studies, or are also a fun source of entertainment, technology can be great. But it\u2019s good to step back sometimes and imagine what it would be like if one day all those things instantly disappeared. After your initial withdrawal symptoms, you\u2019d realize that life goes on without material things. What matters most are our loved ones\u2014our friends and family members. Sometimes we can forget this truth, and that\u2019s when we tend to act selfishly.\nThe act of giving not only helps those we give to, but us as well. Luke 6:38 says, \u201cGive, and it will be given to you.\u201d2 Sometimes what you get back will be something tangible, such as the Lord supplying things you need or someone giving to you, but more often than not what you receive in return is the satisfaction that you did something good. Have you ever given someone something they really needed or wanted and watched their face light up? It\u2019s an amazing feeling!\nAn old American movie from the 1930s called The Man Who Played God is about a concert pianist who lost his hearing in a bomb explosion. He finally got through his depression when he learned how to read lips. He\u2019d watch people in Central Park (New York City), where they\u2019d talk about their problems and troubles, and he would do what he could to solve their problems anonymously. I think it would be amazing to do something like that, to know what other people need and be able to secretly give it to them.\nThere is a cute kids\u2019 song that one or two of you may have heard when you were knee high to a grasshopper, called, \u201cI\u2019d Like to Be Invisible.\u201d The singer wishes he was invisible so that he could \u201cspread love everywhere, and help in secret ways without you knowing he was there.\u201d (Yup, it even rhymed!) The truest part of the song, though, is where it concludes that you don\u2019t have to be invisible, because you can do things to make a difference all around you. You can make it a point to look for where the need is and do what you can to fill it.\nIt\u2019s a funny story but it rings true. It\u2019s easy for me to think that if I had a million dollars, I\u2019d love to give it away to help people, or to ponder all the great things I\u2019d do for my family with money like that; but when it comes to giving away a small portion of my free time to parents who could use a break from their kids, or doing a favor that costs me in the here and now, that\u2019s where the true essence of giving really kicks in.\nI know a lot of missionaries who do great works of evangelism and charity, and it\u2019s inspiring to read about the orphanages they help and the seminars they host, and all the other great projects they do. However, I have a very personal description of what makes a missionary: it\u2019s someone with a giving heart. That means not only do they do big, impressive (and usually well-advertised) works to help the poor or disadvantaged, but they\u2019re also always there to lend a helping hand whenever there is a need. They give to their own hurt; and they don\u2019t ask for or expect favors in return. They don\u2019t have a personal agenda. They just give. And you can feel their love and kindness in their actions. They\u2019re the ones you only ask for help when you really need it, because you know they\u2019ll do everything in their power to help you. In return, you want to do anything you can to help them. Their lives are examples of cheerful and selfless giving.\nI would love to be remembered as someone like that! Sure, we all have bouts of selfishness, and human nature tends to take the path of least resistance, but it\u2019s something to strive for, don\u2019t you think? Sometimes giving can be as simple as a sincere compliment, a hug, or a word of appreciation. It can also be giving your favorite gizmo to your little brother or sister when it would mean the world to them.\n3 Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883\u2013April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese artist, poet, and writer.",

    "text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.",

    "text": "The Eastern Playoff race has been decided. The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.",

    "text": "Considering last fall\u2019s wet weather and the soggy fields this spring, farmers wonder about using inoculants on soybean seed in 2010. Should you use a rhizobium inoculant? Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don\u2019t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says. This process, nitrogen fixation, is critical for producing high soybean yields. For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn\u2019t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn\u2019t recommended because it typically doesn\u2019t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems. The total number of nodules that form decreases with increasing amounts of applied N.\nToday, most fields in the Midwest have had soybeans grown on them in the crop rotation, likely increasing population density of Bradyrhizobia bacteria in the soil, notes Saeugling. Improved inoculant technology, coupled with higher commodity prices, ease of application and relatively low-cost inoculant products, have many growers reconsidering the use of inoculants.\nSince 2003, ISU agronomists have conducted trials each year to assess new inoculants on the market. Overall, the ISU studies haven\u2019t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven\u2019t been grown in the field for the past three to five years. Other situations where it\u2019s recommended to inoculate are if soil pH is below 6.0, or if a field has sandy soil, or if a field has been flooded for more than a week, creating anaerobic conditions.\nRising cost of production and volatile commodity prices are driving the need for soybean growers to improve profits. But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently. In fact, using inoculants on soybeans without an active on-farm testing program could be costing you money. But if a field hasn\u2019t produced soybeans in the past three to five years or has never produced soybeans, an inoculant is needed for nitrogen fixation to occur.",

    "text": "Far Left Van Jones Admits that Trump Can Win and Gives Major Warning to Democrats - Video - Stumpin' For Trump!\nCNN contributor and former Obama aide Van Jones put out a warning to his fellow Democrats on Friday: Donald Trump is probably going to win the White House.\nIn the Facebook video, Jones credited Trump\u2019s ability to understand and use social media and reality television as well as his appeal to black voters as reasons he will likely win the White House in November.\nJones likened Trump to Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama in the sense that they all excelled in a new medium that no other politician could easily master.\n\u201cJust like FDR changed the rules of the game because he mastered radio, he was able to take radio and just completely master that \u2014 then you had JFK and JFK was able to master television \u2014 new medium, new master, new president,\u201d Jones said.\nHe continued to detail how Trump has been able to use his celebrity to appeal to parts of the Democratic base, especially black voters.\n\u201cIf only 70 percent don\u2019t like Donald Trump, that means 30 percent are open to his argument, if he gets half of those, he\u2019s president,\u201d Jones said.\nA Public Policy Polling report released on Monday showed Jones might be correct in his opinion that Trump is winning over large segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc. The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?",

    "text": "It took three overtimes, but No. 16-ranked St. Thomas held off a hot-shooting host Augsburg team Saturday in conference men's basketball play in Minneapolis. The Toms rode freshman guard Anders Nelson's heroics to win 112-105.\nNelson scored 35 of his career-best 37-points after halftime, and added seven rebounds, seven assists and four steals. He sank 10 of 10 at the line in the final two overtimes, and made all 12 tries on the game. He twice made shots to tie the game and extend it into the next overtime.\nThe Tommies (12-1 overall, 8-0 MIAC) ran their win streak to 12 and stayed in a share of the MIAC lead with St. John's. They also helped amend an 0-3 record last season against Augsburg. Senior Connor Bair finished with 28 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks.\nCoach John Tauer's Tommies trailed by eight points in the first half, nine in the second half, and two in the first OT. They later trailed 88-83 with 49 seconds left in the second overtime before storming back to force a third OT. They even trailed 93-91 in the third OT before Connor Bair's three-point play put them ahead to stay at 94-93.\nSt. Thomas was outscored 54-27 in 3-point scoring. The biggest trey came with :02 left in regulation and the Toms ahead 63-60 when the Auggies' Matt Carik sank a tying shot from deep in the corner.\nThe Tommies' comeback was aided by sinking 29-of-33 free throws and committing just 11 turnovers in the 55-minute game.\nThey also survived another huge game by Auggie junior Booker Coplin, the MIAC's leading scorer at 25.6 ppg. Coplin had 34 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and four blocks while playing all 55 minutes.\nNelson drove the length of the floor and hit a pull-up 14-footer at the end of the first OT to tie the game. He made four free throws in the final :05 of the second OT to help erase deficits of three and two points and force a third extra session. He sank two 3-pointers and scored 12 points in the third overtime.\nSt. Thomas plays at Bethel on Wednesday night.",

Read on to learn more about Leviton fiber optics, available right here at CableOrganizer.com!\nBefore you can terminate optical fiber, you've got to get it squeaky clean. For just that reason, you'll find a wide variety of Leviton fiber optic consumables products at CableOrganizer.com. The standard Leviton Consumables Kit comes complete with alcohol pads, polyester wipes, music wire, and lapping film. The Fast-Cure Kit is made up of all the adhesive, accelerator, needles and syringes needed for terminations with Leviton's Fast-Cure connectors. We even carry Leviton's Adhesive Accelerator kit, which contains primer and hardener for use with fiber optic connector adhesives.\nLeviton Fan Out Kits are perfect for separating and protecting 250-micron fibers during fan out terminations, and make it easy to route them into 900-micron color-coded buffer tubes. Fan out kits are available in 24\" and 36\" lengths, for 6-fiber or 12-fiber configurations.\nWhether you need to terminate single-mode or multimode fiber, Leviton's FastCAM connectors allow you to make fast, precise field terminations. Using a proven and revolutionary mechanical splice technology, FastCAM connectors eliminate the need for hand polishing, specials tools, and even epoxy! After a cleaved fiber is inserted into a FastCAM connector, the installer simply releases the factory-installed wedge clip, and an instant low-loss connection is formed.\nEIA/TIA compliant FastCAM connectors are available in LC, SC or ST styles. They're perfect for any indoor premise or fiber-to-the-subscriber installation, as well as applications that require a fast data network.

    "text": "In fact, there are currently over a million international students studying in the United States. India and China are by far the two largest contributors, with 47% of all students for the 2015-2016 school year.\nThe visa application process can be confusing though, especially when English isn\u2019t your strong suit. We at TransparentCareer have laid out each type of visa used by international students, and the application process for each visa.\nF1 Visa\u2013 These are the most common type of visas, and are used for bachelor and graduate school degrees, as well as training programs in the English language. The first step is to check whether the university you\u2019re interested in is verified by the United States government \u2013 you can\u2019t get an F1 visa for non accredited universities. Take a look here to see if your school is verified. The first step is to apply to universities where you want to study. Upon acceptance, the university will provide you with a form I-20. Keep in mind \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer once you select a school. Make sure it\u2019s the right fit for you! You\u2019ll then have to go to the site of the US embassy closest to you, and pay a non refundable application fee. Find the embassy closest to you here.\nYou\u2019ll then have to prepare for an interview \u2013 the sooner you can set this up the better. The interviewer will require proof of intent to return to your country after you complete your education (such as family, home job offer) as well as a passport and the form I-20 provided by your school. The interview will also require proof of financial sufficiency to fund your education. If you need advice on how to finance your education, take a look at this guide. Depending on your school you may also have to provide test scores such as the SAT, GMAT, or GRE.\nJ1A Visa\u2013 J1A visas are for those looking to temporarily stay in the US for a work or culture exchange program, such as to be an au pair, international camp counselor, or for specific medical training. To be accepted, you have to be sponsored by a nonprofit or government organization. You can find a list of all approved organizations here. After applying and being approved by an organization, they\u2019ll provide you with a DS-2019 form to fill out. Then you have to apply for a J1A visa at your nearest US embassy. A Sevis I-901 fee must then be paid (sometimes by your sponsor), along with a Nonimmigrant Application Processing Fee of $160. You must then schedule an appointment with the embassy, giving plenty of time in case anything goes wrong. Bring along the DS-2019 form provided by your sponsor, as well as your passport, a 2\u00d72 photo, and any additional documentation that may be required depending on the nature of your program. You can find the types of documentation on the J1A government site.\nM1A Visa\u2013 This is visa for vocational training in the US. There must be a specific program/school when you apply for the visa, and you\u2019ll have certain requirements and forms you might have to fill out for the school before applying for a visa. You aren\u2019t allowed to work while studying in the US, so you must prove to the school that you have enough money to stay in the US while getting your training. If approved by the school, they\u2019ll give you a form I-20 to fill out, which you\u2019ll need next when you set up a meeting at your nearest US Embassy. You\u2019ll also have to pay an application fee, and bring your passport, a photo (with rules provided by your consulate), a DS-160 form, and a DS-157 form if you\u2019re a male between the ages of 16 and 45.\nH1B Visa- H1B work visas are for those that have completed a higher form of education and want to work in America \u2013 it\u2019s the most common way for foreign students to stay and work in the US after graduation. These visas have to be filed by your employer, so if you\u2019re hoping to stay in America after graduation you should start the job search as soon as possible. Approvals are done through a lottery system, and start to fill up quickly after the government\u2019s fiscal year starts \u2013 typically October 1. You may file up to 6 months in advance, so filing as close to April 1 as possible is ideal. There are a total of 85,000 visas issued this way each year, and the first 20,000 are reserved for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher levels of education. The remaining 65,000 are available to those with bachelor\u2019s degrees, along with those that didn\u2019t make it past the first round with a master\u2019s or higher level of education.\nA lot of controversy has stirred up around H1B visas recently after the election of Donald Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that he wants to get rid of people who got into the US unfairly. According to Forbes, the top 10 companies that sponsor H1B visas received 25,000 visas in 2014, which is nearly 30% of all issued H1B visas. Of these 10 firms, half were firms based in India, typically working with call centers. Trump and others supportive of a crackdown claim that firms are submitting multiple applications for one person in order to game the system. 236,000 applications were received last year for the 85,000 positions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there were 236,000 applicants. While we haven\u2019t seen what a Trump presidency will look like yet, stopping people from abusing the system may provide more opportunities for foreign students looking to work in the US after graduation.\nCheck out our industry career guides on Finance, Consulting, and Tech to help you decide which is the best fit for you.\nLooking to stay in the states after graduation? You\u2019ll need to get a great job first. TransparentCareer offers free data on career pathing, salary negotiation, and compensation. Sign up for free here.",

    "text": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.",

    "text": "Mississippi State won the Southeastern Conference regular-season title one year after finishing in the league basement.\nNow the Bulldogs want to carry the momentum of that dramatic rise into the postseason.\nMississippi State (40-14-1, 21-9 SEC) enters this week's Southeastern Conference Tournament as the No. 1 seed after winning its first regular-season league title since 1989. The Bulldogs had gone 24-30 overall and 8-22 in conference play in 2015 to finish last in the Western Division and post the SEC's worst overall league record.\nBulldogs coach John Cohen, who played for Mississippi State's last SEC regular-season champions, said there isn't much of a gap separating the top of the conference from the bottom.\n\"If you're an inch off in the Southeastern Conference, you're going to get punched in the mouth a lot,\" Cohen said.\nSEC Tournament play begins Tuesday in Hoover, Alabama. No. 6 seed Vanderbilt (41-15, 18-12) faces No. 11 seed Missouri (26-29, 9-21), No. 7 seed Mississippi (40-16, 18-12) meets No. 10 seed Georgia (27-29, 11-19), No. 8 seed Kentucky (32-24, 15-15) battles No. 9 seed Alabama (31-24, 15-15) and No. 5 seed LSU (39-17, 19-11) tackles No. 12 seed Tennessee (29-27, 9-21) in single-elimination games.\nTuesday's winners advance to double-elimination play beginning Wednesday along with Mississippi State, No. 2 seed South Carolina (42-13, 20-9), No. 3 seed Texas A&M (41-13, 20-10) and No. 4 seed Florida (44-11, 19-10). The tournament returns to a single-elimination format Saturday and has a championship game Sunday.\nMississippi State made its dramatic rise up the standings by getting improvement from its new players and receiving a huge impact from its newcomers. Mississippi State's three top batting averages are owned by freshman Jake Mangum (.427) and junior-college transfers Nathaniel Lowe (.359) and Jack Kruger (.358). Kruger has a team-high .570 slugging percentage, Mangum leads the Bulldogs in on-base percentage (.479) and Lowe has a team-leading 47 RBIs.\n\"Those are all three new guys who have just had great first years,\" Cohen said. \"That's not common in the Southeastern Conference.\"\nCohen also led Kentucky to a regular-season title in 2006 and is the second coach to win an SEC regular-season championship at two different schools. Ron Polk led Mississippi State to four SEC regular-season championships before winning one at Georgia in 2001.\nHere are some things to watch in the SEC tournament.\nFIGHTING FOR POSITION: The top SEC teams already are assured of NCAA Tournament invitations but are trying to improve their positioning. Florida, Texas A&M, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Ole Miss, LSU and Vanderbilt all would like to be considered as regional hosts and/or national seeds.\nBUBBLE BATTLE: Alabama coach Mitch Gaspard and Kentucky's Gary Henderson acknowledge their teams are on the NCAA Tournament bubble after going .500 in conference play during the regular season. The two teams face each other Tuesday. \"You've got to win this game, you've got to get to the double-elimination part, you've probably got to beat (Mississippi State) on Wednesday and build those RPI points,\" Henderson said. Gaspard said that \"the winner of that game is going to have a whole lot more comfort after it and the loser is going to be sitting home on pins and needles for a week.\"\nDOMINANT GATORS/TIGERS: LSU has won five of the last eight SEC tournaments. Florida won last year's SEC Tournament and also earned the title in 2011.\nWHO'S SURGING: Mississippi State is on an 11-game winning streak. LSU had won 11 in a row \u2014 including two straight victories over Florida \u2014 before losing its regular-season finale to the Gators.\nWHO'S MISSING: Auburn (23-33, 8-22) and Arkansas (26-29, 7-23) had the SEC's two worst conference records and consequently didn't make the 12-team tournament field. With its losing record, Arkansas also is expected to miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2001.",

    "text": "WBS: why is it important & why it is not important?\nCan somebody post their view or opinion based on practice, why is it that WBS is not important or why is it that WBS is important in managing project?\nI appreciate all ur input.\ncreating a wbs forces you to think about how you are going to dissect your project and organize your project into meaningful groups or packages of work.\nIt is a way to group your work so that people can understand the where's the what's and the how's you will approcah the work.\nfor example if you were looking for an activity in the 2rd floor of Building B and the activities were not group by building and floor it would be very hard to find.\nAlso by using a wbs you can collapse work and summarise work more easily.\nI love a good WBS!\nSee below link to one of our newsletters.\nI started using activity codes even before WBS functionality was available. And I still use them, precisely for purposes as you mentioned - eg filtering the plastering items etc. And since I started using these things from DOS days, I also make use of the characters in activity ID to represent various things. And as you correctly mentioned, it is also possible to get those functionalities from few characters in the activity description.\nIn fact, the best way to input your coded information is in the activity id. That way, the information is \"in built\" and cannot be changed easily.\nAll these things including searching and filtering (eg for filtering for certain characters in activity id or description) work well when everybody is disciplined in naming and coding. And as long as one person is doing all these things, everything works perfectly well for him (as it does for me and you). But when you are integrating programmes from various contractors, it is not easy to excecise those rules with planners from various firms.\nWBS concept is as old as project management but its functionality appeared relatively late. Even in P3 3.1, WBS is still optional function that appears the same way as acivity codes. And some people still don\u0092t use it because 1) it is optional 2) activity codes seem to do the same job and 3) they are more used to activity codes. But even in P3 3.0, WBS code can do things which activity codes can\u0092t.\nFor example, you can have WBS activity and it does not need any links as in hammock activities. And this WBS activity can summarise all the activities which have the same WBS code. When you need a high level programme that shows bars in the same line as activity description (activity code roll up bar appears one line below), you can just filter for WBS activities and you get very good presentation. And the list goes on.\nAnd when you start using P3e, WBS is no more optional and it appears more different than activity codes and thus makes it more apparent. But activity code has more functionality in new programmes as well as you can have second level of codes within same acitity code. And these lower levels of codes work exactly the same way as WBS does. So you can have work breakdown stucture as well as ANY breakdown structure using a single code.\nBut as long as you have to use two or more actity codes (as you have to do in P3 3.1 and earlier), to make your work breakdown structure, it is far more easier to do so using the in built WBS coding. (And you can of course, still use activity codes, for other functionalities).\nI can therefore sort as activity description contains plastering and all the activities drop out. Now If I have also coded for floors and towers I can organise so the towers and floors show up so I know where I am.\nThat means I need to code in a tower and a floor with each activity, thats pretty easy cos I can copy and past this info.\nIf I am really smart when I copy and past the fragnet I can add some alpha numerics at the end of the ID ie 100 activity number from fragnet then T1 (tower 1) then F1 ie the id is know 100T1F1 this helps in that I can sort all activities in tower 1 or floor 1 or whatever so by using the ID and the description almost without touching the codes we have a pretty robust sorting catergory. In turn when you can sort in this way logic application and resource balancing becomes much easier.\nLets go back to the plastering scenario we now have all the activities, so linking floor to floor or globally copying resources is easy as is levelling them because you can see whats happening and more importantly so can everybody else.\nIn this way you can tell your subby exactly what he needs.\nI am not saying you cant do it with WBS and of course you can what I am saying is for a great deal of what we do in building and Civil Engineering WBS codeing is excessively complicated.\nI\u0092m Currently using Hierarchical code structures to help with the application of the cost accounts from our cost tool. I simply apply the codes to the activities and then group and sort with totals and balance my activity budgets.\nSo you can use code fields to give rudimentry totals for Units.\nThis process has helped me immensley as when I started with this company 9 weeks ago there wern\u0092t even any baselines in the projects and they were using units % Complete and just adding extra hours to the remainings by multiples of 10 or 50. They even expected to be able to resource level with this data.\nActivity codes look good and seems to show what you want to show only when data is organized in a particular way (eg phase, location, contractor etc). So it is very much a Layout depedent method.\nWBS works no matter how you organize your activities. And you can have WBS activity (in P3 for example) which summarises all the activities which have the same WBS code no matter where those activites are located. There is no such functionality available for activity codes.\nFurthermore when you organize activities with acitity codes, you will always end up with groups with no names. Planner would understand it but there would be many would be questining it everytime they see it.\nSo when you want work breakdown that really add up to whole project, use WBS. It is that simple. And use activity codes for other organizing and filtering purpose.\nI suppose WBS & Codes are lying on the same concept, so why bother? you\u0092re not showing codes on your schedule anyway.\nDont let anybody walk away with the idea when you have explained something \"gee I wonder what he is smoking\"\nOften in fact more often than I care to remember I dont employ planners because they cant do their job but because they cant explain what their job is.\nRemember we are planners, that makes us somebody who assists the process not somebody who actually does it, so go and assist the person doing it by understanding what he wants not what you feel you should give him.\nThe WBS structure is simply an end to a means.\nThe end is being able to provide BAC, ACWP, ETC, EAC & EV for particular portions of the project.\nThe WBS is simply the most widley used method of doing this, and as a consequence comes as a standard part (or code) of most planning/scheduling software.\nAs far as codes go - well the world is your oyster.\nAs far as how to, and what size, and by what method you chose to quantify and divide your project up, it\u0092s really up to you..... However you should document what each structre is for and what assumptions were made to arrive at the particular structure.\nCBS - Cost Breakdown Structure, ETC.\nAgain I will say it\u0092s limitless to how many you can have, but you should document what it is and how you came up with it.\nThat way when you\u0092re asked to explain a code field that you thought was a good idea at the time - Your manager doesn\u0092t walk away with the \"I don\u0092t know what that guy was on about\" thought in their head.\nthis is very simple! you use WBS or Codes to make your Project become \"Measurable\" either in a summarized form or a detailed one. But how do you put a certain unit to a summarized deliverable? Isn\u0092t it Lump Sum (LS)? and how do you define Lump Sum? are you gonna need WBS or Codes?\nWhile the Explanation is well \"dry but clear\"\nI think all would benefit more if you provided sonme clarity with examples.\nAs I have mention before WBS development can be viewed as the process of grouping all project elements into several major categories, normally referred to as Level One; each one of these categories will itself contain several subcategories, normally referred to as Level Two. Alternately, and more accurately, developing a WBS involves dividing the deliverable items until the project has been divided into manageable, discrete, and identifiable items requiring simple tasks to complete that, when combined, constitute the project deliverable.\nLogically is to keep dividing the project until the elements cannot realistically be divided anymore and may vary from organization to organization or may even vary among project managers within the same organization.\nEach level of detail contains not only organization specific, but they also are specific to the nature of the deliverables involved in each project. Similarly, the degree of detail at the lowest level of each branch must be in line with the size of the project and in conformance with the organization\u2019s operational philosophies.\nIdeally, there should be some uniformity and consistency in the WBS. To achieve this uniformity, all children of the same parent must be developed based on the same division basis.\nUsual practice of WBS are using three division levels which are \u201cDeliverables oriented (Structure or products, functional system, physical area and proof of capability)\u201d, \u201cSchedule oriented (normally referring to a task or activity and sequential/ phases)\u201d and \u201cResource oriented (disciplines, administrative units and financial accounts)\u201d.\nSo again, no matters how you do it by codes or groups fields or using the WBS field as long as you define the structure into manageable level and represent the project deliverable that will contribute to success of the project.\nMost of my work is in building construction, so maybe the fact that I like codes better is biased by my work.\nBut if sometimes you need to see activities organized by floor; sometimes by trade; other time by trade within each floor, etc. There\u2019s no way to do that except with codes.\nDo other lines of work have the same need or is it enough for you to squeeze into a rigid WBS and limit reports and analisys to that single point of view?\nwhat I believe it says is that progranmmes should be structured in such a way as to enable sorting in a logical and affective manner thus enabling the team to ascertain an accurate picture of the progress of the works and the elements that make up the works.\n\"for hard planning thinkers\"?? they don\u0092t know how to use codes?\nWBS show the heirarchy of Scope of work and deliverables.\nWBS is the standard for PMI, PMP, Planning Professional.\nIt is very clear in PMI influence or way of project management in general and planning in particular way of managing project.\nSo for hard planning thinkers, WBS is the preference.\nI think the need and importance of structure in a schedule is clear and proven. The point now is how.\nI prefer primavera codes over WBS or outlines. Codes are much more flexible and let you organize activities in different ways to analize different aspects of a schedule. WBS an outlines are rigid.\nOf course you can use both at the same time, but unless I\u00b4m forced by a client, I don\u00b4t use a WBS, but codes.\nIt\u0092s just a simple divide and conquer technique. It a way to go from general to specifics. It\u0092s like writing a book first you have the outline the going to the details and contents.In a way it helps in organizing a project and simplify the job of a planner.\nBreakdown Structure - Work, Cost, Organization..whatever it is..It is important! I think nobody is using a one liner schedule!\nJust to explain more on WBS. As I have said on the other thread (Work Breakdown Structure is a results-oriented family tree that captures all the work of a project in an organized way. It is often portrayed graphically as a hierarchical tree; however, it can also be a tabular list of \"element\" categories and tasks or the indented task list that appears in your Gantt chart schedule). Meaning it can be shown on a different approach or style as long as it became meaningful and useful to other member of project management. It defines as a level of schedule to make it more sensible and manageable. It is used to define the project objectives with sufficient detail information into more detail groups of scope or task. Some planner/ scheduler used activity codes as their WBS and others are just the first 1, 2, 3 or 4 character of their activities.\nProper schedules are using this technique according to their own methods so they can level their schedule to more manageable levels.\nOn my own view \u201cschedule without the proper work breakdown structure is going nowhere or meaningless as its does not show the sensible picture of the project\u201d.\nAny serious program must have some kind of organization so it is usable for control.\nWBS is one way, but there\u0092s also activity codes.\nThe more detail that you want to see (monitor), the more important the WBS. A formal and logical structure helps capture the project data (activity type, resourcing, costing, progress etc.) in the most appropriate \"pigeon-hole\".",

Select from 18 transmitter wavelengths for full CWDM compatibility (ITU-T G.694.2).\nThe OTR 1840 will auto-detect and re-clock any 270Mbit / 1.5Gbit and 3Gbit SDI source prior to conversion.

    "text": "\u201d It may seem surreal, but as work continues to decommission damaged reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant\u2013a project that involves 7,000 or so workers\u2013tours of the complex by outsiders are becoming increasingly popular.\nBy the end of last September, or four-and-a-half years since the nuclear accident triggered by the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami disaster, some 16,000 people had visited.\nInitially, visitors to the stricken facility were mainly politicians and specialists. But more recently, ordinary citizens are taking part as radiation levels have fallen at the plant site.\nNineteen university students took a tour last November. The bus they rode took them past large tanks holding contaminated water as well as a massive piece of equipment attached to a reactor building to extract nuclear fuel. Throughout the visit, workers wearing protective clothing and face masks could be seen.\nThe tour was organized by a group called AFW, which stands for Appreciate Fukushima Workers. Led by Akihiro Yoshikawa, 35, a former employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken plant, the group began escorting tours by residents living along the Pacific coast of Fukushima Prefecture from 2015. A major objective of the tours is to show residents what decommissioning involves.\n\u201cIf ordinary citizens abandon interest, the plant site will be further shut off from the rest of the world,\u201d Yoshikawa said.\nHe said that 140 or so people had participated in the seven tours organized to date.\nIwaki resident Kaori Suganami, 39, took part in a tour last June.\nBecause of the core meltdowns at the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors, high levels of radiation continue to be emitted. This makes it very difficult to approach those three reactors.\nElsewhere, though, rubble that was strewn throughout the plant grounds due to the tsunami generated by the magnitude-9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake has been removed, and radiation levels in many areas have dropped significantly. Ground surfaces have been paved and trees felled, which has also helped lower radiation levels.\nAccording to TEPCO, about 900 people visited in the first year after the nuclear accident. Since then, the annual number of visitors has continued to increase. Local residents joining the tours also grew in number. About 3,700 people visited the plant in the first half of fiscal 2015. Of that number, about 250 were from Fukushima Prefecture.\nUnlike workers at the plant site, visitors are not required to wear heavy protective gear. The basic getup is cotton gloves, disposable face masks and special footwear. Visitors are required to carry dosimeters. To reduce radiation exposure, visitors remain on the bus for large parts of the tour. Radiation exposure after an hour is in the range of 10 microsieverts, which is about 1 percent of the maximum additional radiation exposure of 1 millisievert established for the general population.\nIn April 2014, TEPCO established a visitation center at the Fukushima plant and two to three groups consisting of individuals 18 or older are allowed in daily. But not just anyone is allowed on the tours. \u201cAn overall assessment is made after considering such factors as the objective of the visit,\u201d said a TEPCO official.\nThe decommissioning work is expected to take decades.\n\u201d FUKUSHIMA\u2013Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s population has declined by 5.7 percent since 2010, its largest recorded drop and the cause of a widening gender gap in some areas, according to national census figures announced on Dec. 25.\nThe population drop is mainly due to ongoing evacuations following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to the preliminary figures released by the prefectural government.\nThe prefecture lost 39,715 men and 75,743 women, a decrease of 4 percent and 7.3 percent from 2010, respectively. The difference is thought to have been caused partly by the majority male presence in reconstruction efforts.\nThe national census figures are the first released by the prefectural government since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.\nFukushima prefecture\u2019s population as of Oct. 1 stood at 1,913,606, down 115,458, or 5.7 percent, from the last census in 2010.\nAmong the six towns and villages where the entire population has left under evacuation orders, four towns recorded zero inhabitants: Okuma and Futaba, which co-host the nuclear plant, and nearby Tomioka and Namie.\nThe village of Katsurao had 18 people who have returned to their homes after being evacuated. They are recorded as temporary residents, but the central government is working to make their resettlement permanent. Katsurao\u2019s evacuation order is scheduled to be lifted next spring.\nNaraha, where an evacuation order was lifted on Sept. 5, also experienced a massive decrease in its population, with 976 people living in the area, down 6,724 people, or 87.3 percent, from 2010. The figures illustrate the fact that few evacuees have opted to return home.\nThe town of Hirono, where a large portion of the population is involved in nuclear reactor decommissioning work, tallied a male population of 2,746, up 2.3 percent from 2010. The female population, on the other hand, was about half that figure at 1,577, down 42.3 percent.\nThe population figures are based on the number of people living in the prefecture as of Oct. 1, irrespective of whether they are registered as local citizens.\n\u201d Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant, has opened a rest area and canteen for cleanup workers, more than four years after the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\nTokyo Electric has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions at the plant.\n\u201cWe have taken various steps to cut accidents, including Tokyo Electric itself working more with contractors on the ground,\u201d Akira Ono, Fukushima plant manager, told Reuters.",

    "text": "Sign up to Lineout to stay up to date with all of the latest RUPA news / Thanks for subscribing!\nWith Rugby World Cup (\u201cRWC\u201d) underway the eyes of the world are on our sport. One of the most topical debates across all contact sports is the issue of concussion management.\nAll stakeholders will be looking forward to a RWC in which players, medical personnel and team support staff play their part in managing this important aspect of player welfare. Rugby is making significant progress in the detection and management of concussion and it will be important that other professional rugby competitions move to adopt the standards set for RWC 2015. Rugby should not see the management of concussion as a risk at RWC, but an opportunity to demonstrate how far the game has come in recent times.\nThe International Rugby Players Association (\u201cIRPA\u201d) is constantly thinking about what more can be done to further improve the games ability to manage the issues associated with concussion.\nEffective from 1st August 2015 after a successful global trial period at elite level, World Rugby has now formally introduced a temporary substitution rule. This applies to any player who is removed from the field of play to undertake a Head Injury Assessment (HIA) when it is unclear if that player has a suspected concussion.\nHaving the ability to remove a player from the action and from the cauldron of a packed stadium, to undertake a thorough clinical assessment and video review of an incident, in a private controlled environment, makes good practical sense. Previously players in this situation would often go untreated, or be checked over briefly on field using questionable methods.\nWorld Rugby and other key stakeholders are leading a real culture shift amongst professional players, coaches and medical personnel in relation to peer pressure to play. Recent statistics back this up. Research has underpinned the HIA process throughout. Prior to the temporary substitution trial, 56 per cent of players with a confirmed concussion remained on the field following their injury. Now that figure is less than 12 per cent (British Journal of Sports Medicine, 2014) and the hope is that following continued refinement of the HIA process we will see further improvement in 2015 and beyond.\nA key point lost on many but one that IRPA believes is fundamental to a conservative management approach is that a player is now removed once the attending medics confirm a diagnosis of suspected concussion. This takes the pressure off trying to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion during a high-pressured game. That does mean players will be removed who have not suffered a concussion, but better the conservative approach.\nThankfully the message is getting through and along with World Rugby\u2019s #RecogniseAndRemove campaign, the games stakeholders are realising that it is not just the player\u2019s responsibility but its coaches, referees, and team support staffs obligation to step in if they suspect a concussion has occurred.\nWhilst IRPA see this as a positive step, it is one that needs to be continually developed and filtered down to the community game where awareness and education on the subject is not yet at the same level.\nMedical specialist in concussion monitoring individual cases.\nAdditionally, IRPA is very supportive and engaged on the work that is being undertaken on the laws of the game to ensure the risks of on-field instances that result in serious injury, including concussive events, are minimised.\nThere is much conjecture on if rugby, and concussions sustained playing the game, lead to long-term cognitive health issues. From a player\u2019s perspective IRPA does not want that debate to be a distraction from making sure the right thing is done by the players now. IRPA believes that the game should be doing all it can to ensure the welfare and health of the player is an ongoing priority.\nSo what of the future and in particular the debate of using new technologies to take human error out of the equation? One such advancement that may justify further research and refinement is the use of sensors to help aide team doctors with real-time data. It could provide insight into accelerations and forces that they may not have seen first-hand particularly where the player has either not recognised a head knock, chosen not to seek medical assistance or suffered signs and symptoms post game. The sensor does not diagnose a concussion but rather provides accurate previously unavailable live information which combined with testing (HIA) and baseline data can aid in a clinical diagnosis. In the same way team support staff use other data like heart rates and GPS data, the sensor can provide data to assist medical personnel make informed decisions regarding concussion management.\nFrom a player welfare perspective, IRPA believes the pressure put on players to return to play to preserve their contracts and the rehabilitative support provided to players recovering from a concussion are areas that should be looked at further.\nEnsuring a players contractual terms and conditions are supportive during times of serious injury is fundamental. It allows the player the opportunity to fully recover without the added pressure or threat of having his or her salary or match payments stopped, or worse, the contract terminated. In this respect physical injuries are more obvious and certain, concussion in its very nature is obscure and invisible. Currently there are no set guidelines around minimum standards for players\u2019 contractual terms and conditions. IRPA feels that the time is right to address this, not just because of the issues around concussion, but to maintain the integrity and reputation of the game.\nFor those players who endure concussion complications either as part of their return to play process, or following a decision to stop playing, there seems little available to aide recovery beyond rest and time \u2013 which for an active professional athlete can be a very uncertain and sometimes depressing experience. IRPA would support more research into identifying rehabilitation techniques and programs to help in the resilience building and recovery process, and to ensure they are readily understood and available throughout the game.\nWorld leading player welfare standards are a priority in building the legacy of our sport. It is fundamental to the integrity of the game and to those who participate in it. IRPA is looking forward to continuing to work with World Rugby to bring about the culture change and to enhance the education and regulatory framework that ensures rugby leads the way on concussion management globally.\nThe Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) will continue to take a proactive and collaborative approach to concussion prevention and management in Australia sport, as part of its involvement with the Australian Athletes' Alliance (AAA).\nEvery week, RUPA collates five of the best features from the week\u2019s Rugby media and bring them to you in the one convenient location.\nCharlie Fetoai: Jack of all trades; master of plenty!\nFormer Reds centre Charlie Fetoai was seriously injured in 2009 and told he could never play Rugby again. He spoke to RUPA about what he's been up to since, and the importance of planning for life after Rugby.",

The Anubias Coffeefolia will have 5 or more leaves.\nAnubias barteri var. coffeefolia is a low cultivar of Anubias barteri. Its characteristic is that the leaves arch considerably between the leaf ribs, and the new leaves are red-brown. The color combination and leaf shape make it an attractive variety in both large and small aquariums. It flowers frequently under water but does not produce seeds.\nAnubias barteri var. coffeefolia is not eaten by herbivorous fish.\nI have a few of these available so you are not buying the exact piece shown in the picture but all the pieces will look just as good if not better than the one pictured.",

It looks like most people are against to this statement.\nNemiroff posted 4 arguments to the agreers part.\nNemiroff, historybuff and 3 visitors agree.\nYiyi, chasediedrich1, NPW, DrMrDaniel, chemikilsm0ke and 3 visitors disagree.\nwhy is it that your entire post deflected to the democrats and completely dodged the topic of the thread, the contents of the actual Republican memo?\nis it because the contents of that memo themselves are indefensible?\nmy entire opening post explained why it was fake. so your opening jab is a miss.\nNunez used half truths to lie to the American people. regardless of the damage that should spark far more outrage.\nthe damage was to sources and methods of intelligence gathering. it makes intelligence gathering harder for our professionals. do you think you as a civilian would notice the damage? did you notice the snowden damage? of course not. what were you expecting the damage to be? an instant invasion? I think you are making arbitrary excuses to avoid laying blame on your party no matter how badly they slapped you and the American people.\nI love how democrats always dissmis the memo as a fake but rarely point out why it's fake. I also remember that democrats stated that the memo would cause major problems and liberal media cites were buzzing with why releasing the memo would bring terrible consequences, yet none of that happened. It's almost as if there was something in that memo democrats didn't want released.\nanyone have any argument for why it wasn't garbage?\nfrankly garbage isn't strong enough. it was outright lies to try to undermine an investigation into potential treasonous activities. when the investigation leads to more charges I hope they investigate Nunes as well for his willful attempt to cover it up.\nit represented the Steele dossier as the only evidence when it was supported by numerous independent sources.\nit said the fbi hide the fact that one of its leads was started for a partisan purpose, but they openly told the judge that, who then judged it valid.\nit forgot to mention that the warrant was renewed several times, meaning it was providing valid intelligence in the eyes of the court. which included numerous republician judges who approved it.\nthis political farce needs to end. cherry picking from classified data to build a false narrative to deceive the American people, there need to be treason charges brought on some. starting with Devon Nunez. if anyone is colluding, it's him.",

    "text": "For the month of April only: Receive Dermapen 4 Face & Neck Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nWe are proud to launch the new Dermapen 4 at Natural Aesthetics. We were the first clinic in South Africa to receive the Dermapen 4. So what makes the Dermapen 4 so much better than the Dermapen 3 or any other microneedling device?\nDermapen 4 has a 16 needle cartridge instead of just 12 needles, reaching an inflammatory response at a much quicker rate.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 47.9% more micro-channels than Dermapen 3 and 104% more micro-channels than any counterfeit device.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 1,920 puncture channels per second, which means we can almost double the amount of serums and actives that we needle into the skin per treatment, than before.\nThe additional 620 micro-channels makes the treatment much quicker and more comfortable than before.\nDermapen 4 is the only microneedling device with a dedicated scar setting and protocols for revision of deep, atrophic scars; including surgical, burn contracture, striae and post-acne scars. Needle penetration can now be increased up to 3.0mm.\nAOVN technology, automatically calibrates the motor speed, pressure and penetration for targeted precision.\nThe Dermapen 4 is safer than other microneedling devices, no dragging or pulling of the skin.\nOnly Dermapen 4 features a unique, medical-grade silicone seal and fluid guard. The external cartridge is fortified with a specialised fluid guard that prevents cross contamination to the outer cartridge shell. Safety First!\nSpecialised retention valves relieve the build-up of procedural pressure within the Dermapen 4 needle cartridge. The effect prevents fluid build-up within the needle cavity. The vacuum-like sensation removes the risk of cross contamination whilst ensuring pressure-free contact to the skin during a procedure.\nTop: Medical grade numbing cream applied for 20 \u2013 30 minutes, we then needle medical grade serums and actives into the skin via the Dermapen 4 device. Bottom: An Alginate Mask is applied and connected to our IonZyme Machine. A medical grade concealer is applied to speed up recovery and cover any immediate post treatment redness.\nThe Dermapen is an award winning micro-needling device.\nWe use the Dermapen 4 to create safe pathways to deliver quality anti-aging serums deep into the skin.\nNew collagen and elastin are now being produced by the body; tightening the skin and healing scars, fine lines and literally keeping the skin young and full of volume.\nWhat is the Dermapen 4 good for?\nSkin conditions: Treat pigmentation, skin texture, oily skin, acne and sun damaged skin.\nThe numbing cream that we apply is a 30% Lidocaine medical-grade numbing cream that is only available at medical practices. Should your skincare \u201cclinic\u201d, not have an overseeing doctor, chances are that you are not receiving the appropriate numbing cream (only a 2% Lidocaine), which can make this treatment uncomfortable.\nThe concentrated actives in the mask are delivered into the skin immediately after a microneedling treatment to instantly cool and soothe the skin and to improve the skins health complexion.\nThe IonZyme machine introduces the use of Pulsed Iontophoresis; the use of a specifically pulsed electrical current to facilitate penetration of vitamins into the cells.\nImmediately post this microneedling treatment, we apply an Alginate mask over the face. We then connected it to our IonZyme Machine to send an electrical current via the mask. This reduces inflammation to speed up recovery. The mask itself is infused with skin corrective peptides and anti-inflammatory actives which makes it the perfect compliment for the skin after a Dermapen treatment.\nNatural Aesthetics is not a spa of \u201cbeauty salon\u201d; we are a medical practice.\nOur Therapists are specially trained to administer medical microneedling and IonZyme Machine treatments safely and correctly.\nEach of our Therapists have also received special training by Dr Wade Merchant to further ensure that our patients receive the safest and most effective treatments.\nFor the month of April only: Receive a Face & Neck Dermapen 4 Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nOR call us on 021 433 0967.",

    "text": "African/Lake Malawi cichlids have very specialised feeding habits that have been adapted so that they can survive in their natural habitat. However aquarists tend to make it easier for themselves by getting readily prepared flakes and pellets. But you will have to take into account whether your fish are herbivores or \u2018piscivores\u2019 (feed on other fish). Mbuna species are normally herbivore, so they will mainly feed on the algae that grows on rocks, so they must be fed on plant food. These fish cannot digest animal fat and will suffer from indigestion if fed on it.\nOn the other hand most Lake Malawi cichlids will eat small crustaceans like Brine Shrimps.\nA lot of cichlid breeders make up their own homemade food, made from chopped up shrimp and peas.\nThaw out the shrimps and peas and mince them finely in a food mixer, then add the vitamin drops. Finally pour in the dissolved gelatine. The gelatine will bind the mixture, producing a thick paste after it has cooled. Place the paste into a freezer bag, flatten and then freeze. Now this nutritious fish food can easily be cut up into convenient pieces, and given to your fish.\nA wide range of foods are commercially available, like flakes and pellets. It has been noticed that cichlids feed very enthusiastically on flakes, while pellets sink to the bottom, so any other inhabitants like catfish can get it. The choice is yours.\nA further important source of food for your African cichlids, are frozen foods like white and black mosquito larvae, brine shrimps and krill.\nMixes including beef heart and frozen RED mosquito larvae are not suitable for Lake Malawi Cichlids.\nHow often you feed your Lake Malawi cichlids depends on their age. Fry (Newly born fish) must be fed more frequently and in smaller portions than older fish. Fry should literally be swimming in food in order to grow quickly and develop properly.\nHerbivores are more used to feeding in small portions over the day, so feeding them once a day will not be enough. And you must take care to only put in the right amount of food. It should take about 1 minute for all of the food to be eaten.\nAdult cichlids should be fed 2-3 times a day while the fry should be fed 5-7 times a day. If the fish are fed regularly then their aggression should be reduced.\nNever feed your fish just after you have switched the light on as they will need reach their full levels of daytime activity. The African cichlids rest at night and it takes them about thirty minutes to become fully active. And for similar reasons, you should not give them their final feed just before turning the light out.\nIf you don\u2019t think that you will be able to feed your fish at the correct times each day, then you should consider installing an automatic feeding machine.\nIt is important not to overfeed your fish as your cichlids will consume anything, and in huge quatities if they can, which can harm their health. Healthy African Cichlids will always await their food eagerly.\nIf an adult cichlid is eating poorly or refusing food then don\u2019t feed them at all for one full day afterwards as it may be overfed. If they still fail to eat after the day off, then they may have contracted a disease.\nThey are. Were they cichlids or tropical fish? Thank you for your comment by the way.\nI love aquarium fish and used to keep quite a few of them. They are a lot of fun and beautiful to watch.",

Write letters to the people who played an important role in the unpleasant experiences of your childhood (parents, teachers, uncles, aunts, siblings, grandparents & others).\nNote: It is not necessary to give these letters to the people you are writing them to, only to have expressed them yourself. In some cases, however, once you are clear about this, and have released the emotional charge concerning theses issues, you may want to communicate verbally or in writing with those concerned ? whether they are living or not.\nRemember however that life has given you the experiences you need to proceed in your evolutionary process and that you have probably gained much internally from all this.\n4. Read the letters to someone who is experienced in active listening.\na. If you find that the reading causes strong feelings, express and release them, before you continue reading. Don?t hold these emotions locked inside you.\nb. You may need to read these letters additional times until the emotional charge is released.",

    "text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.",

    "text": "Mark Frigon is a senior product manager with IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization, a key group involved in leading IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce initiative. Mark\u2019s specialties are in Web analytics (he joined IBM as part of its acquisition of Coremetrics) and Internet privacy, an issue that has come to the forefront in recent years for digital marketers around the globe.\nEffective Web metrics are critical to the success of businesses looking to succeed in e-commerce and digital marketing these days, and IBM has a number of experts who spend a lot of their time in this area.\nOne of those here in Madrid at the IBM Smarter Commerce Global Summit, Mark Frigon, is a senior product manager for Web analytics in IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization.\nMark sat down with me to discuss the changing nature of Web analytics, and how dramatically it has evolved as a discipline over the past few years, including the increased focus by marketers on \u201cattribution,\u201d the ability to directly correlate a Web marketing action and the desired result.\nMark also spoke at the event about the importance for digital marketers around the globe to be more privacy-aware, a topic we also discussed in our time together, calling out in particular the \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d industry self-regulatory effort that intends to put privacy controls in the hands of consumers.\nIf you spend any time thinking about Internet privacy or Web analytics, or both, this is a conversation you won\u2019t want to miss.\nRemember that team of blackjack-playing cohorts from MIT in the book (and, later, movie) \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d who fleeced a number of Vegas casinos before they were invited never to grace their gambling doors again?\nIBM\u2019s Yuchun Lee explains to the IBM Smarter Commerce audience in Madrid how the company is doubling down on its investments in enterprise and social marketing management.\nWell, IBM executive and Unica co-founder Yuchung Lee was one of those who was asked not to come back. Permanently.\nWhich is okay by those of us at IBM, as we\u2019re keeping him way too busy to bother with card counting.\nInstead, Lee\u2019s mathematical prowess is being applied to help companies improve their marketing capabilities, a key ingredient in the IBM Smarter Commerce soup.\nAs Lee explained in his keynote session this afternoon here in Madrid, \u201cthis is the first time we\u2019re bringing together Coremetrics and Unica.\u201d He also highlighted the fact that out of the 1,700 participants here at the Summit, over 1,000 are marketeers!\nLee provided a broad overview of the Enterprise Marketing Management portfolio at IBM, explaining that \u201cwe\u2019ve shared progress as a group within IBM over the past year,\u201d sharing that also incorporates lessons learned from both the market and IBM customers.\nThe social buildout also incorporates enterprise analytics, tag management, and full mobile and social market capabilities that tie more closely together the marketing automation experience with the social realm.\nLee also debriefed quickly on two recent acquisitions, DemandTec, which expands IBM\u2019s EMM offerings with pricing, promotion, and product mix optimization, and Tealeaf, which rounds out IBM EMM solutions with customer experience management and analytics.\nAs Lee explained, \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what TeaLeaf provides, the ability to look at snapshots of individual user sessions to help determine where, exactly, it is that you\u2019re driving them crazy with your convoluted web experience!\nBut where Lee really \u201chooked\u201d the audience was in his observations about the Generation C customer, who is more connected and in control than ever! Did you know that 4 in 10 smartphone users search for an item in a store? Or that 77 percent of B2B buyers check with their peers before buying?\nWhich, he expanded, means that it must work more closely with other disciplines and functions, including merchandising, on- and offline sales, customer service, and even with IT.\nBut, Lee indicated, they can\u2019t stop there. Marketing must also share customer insights with other parts of the business so that all functions can benefit from these insights.\nFinally, they must extend that sharing of customer insights with other key stakeholders who can benefit: Partners, agencies, customer communities, and so forth.\nLee also explained that many organizations must adjust their marketing cultures to fully capitalize on the \u201cGeneration C\u201d (\u201cC\u201d for \u201cconnected\u201d) culture. They must build organizations that balance analytics and creative talents (easier said than done!), work with IT rather than around IT, and break down marketing siloes \u2014 digital and traditional marketing must consolidate and collaborate.\nFinally, accept mistakes and learn from them, and be agile enough to iterate and improve upon them. As even Lee can explain, there are only so many opportunities to double down in blackjack, and in business.\nThe enterprise marketing management opportunity vis-a-vis IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce strategy is one of those rare opportunities.\nWell, that day of the year has finally arrived.\nThat day where we all slink into our offices after four nice, long, official holidays where (mostly, we hope) people stay away from their computers and mobile phones and tablets and God knows whatever other else connected devices just long enough to make it feel like you got some real rest (even though many of you were probably dealing with unrelated, but similarly frustrating, realities \u2014you know, like screaming kids and antagonizing in-laws).\nAnd all you could do was think about how nice it would be to come back into the nice peaceful and quiet office on Monday so you could get back to\u2026shopping.\nYes, boys and girls, cyber Monday has arrived.\nBut judging from the results of the IBM Coremetrics Benchmark Black Friday e-retailing analysis, you really need not worry about coming into the office anymore just so you can get yourself an extra slurp of broadband.\nThis is 2011, yo, all you gotta do is break out that iPad and you\u2019ll be standing in front of Macys women\u2019s wear or Best Buy\u2019s electronics section in seconds!\nBut while you\u2019re out there figuring out your Cyber Monday strategy, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights reel for the weekend in e-shopping.\nU.S shoppers apparently took great advantage of early sales this holiday, driving a 39.3 percent year-over-year increase in online Thanksgiving day spending while setting the stage for 24.3 percent online growth on Black Friday compared to the same period last year.\nConsumer spending increases. The aggressive shopping we witnessed on Thanksgiving Day this year carried over into Black Friday, with online sales increasing 24.3 percent annually.\nMobile Bargain Hunting. Black Friday also saw the arrival of the mobile deal seeker who embraced their devices as a research tool for both in-store and online bargains. Mobile traffic increased to 14.3 percent (compared to 5.6 percent last year).\nMobile Sales On the Getgo. Sales on mobile devices surged to 9.8 percent (a tripling from last year\u2019s 3.2 percent).\nApple\u2019s One Stop Shop. Mobile shopping was led by Apple, with the iPhone and iPad ranking one and two for consumers shopping on mobile devices (5.4 percent and 4.8 percent respectively). Together, the iPhone and iPad accounted for 10.2 percent of all online retail. Apparently, it ain\u2019t easy bein\u2019 an Android on Black Friday.\nThe iPad Factor. Shoppers using the iPad led to more retail purchases more often per visit than other mobile devices, leading one to wonder about the real estate to deal closing ratio. The bigger the device, the larger the average order value? Possibly, but this number can\u2019t lie: Conversion rates for the iPad were 4.6 percent, compared to 2.8 for all other mobile devices. The iPad was this weekend\u2019s e-shopping mobile king.\nSocial Influence. Shoppers referred from Social Networks generated 0.53 percent of all online sales on Black Friday, with Facebook leading the pack and accounting for a full 75 percent of all social network traffic.\nSocial Media Chit Chat. Boosted by a 110 percent increase in discussion volume compared to 2010, top discussion topics on social media sites immediately before Friday showed a focus on the part of consumers to share tips on how to avoid the rush. Topics included out-of-stock concerns, waiting times and parking, and a spike in positive sentiment around Cyber Monday sales.\nSurgical Shopping Goes Mobile: Mobile shoppers demonstrated a laser focus that surpassed that of other online shoppers with a 41.3 percent bounce rate on mobile devices versus online shopping rates of 33.1 percent.\nThis data came from findings of the IBM Coremetrics fourth annual Black Friday Benchmark, which tracks more than a million transactions a day, analyzing terabytes of raw data from 500 retailers nationwide.\nWith this data, IBM helps retailers better understand and respond to their customers \u2014 across the organization \u2014 improving sourcing, inventory management, marketing, sales, and services programs.\nYou can get more background on the study here.\nBlack Friday: U.S. Online Retail Up 20% Year-Over-Year!\nI had absolutely nothing to do with shopping today, online or off. But I seemed to have been a minority, and for those retailers looking to the holiday season to help bolster an otherwise anemic year, they will be excited by the news delivered today by the IBM Coremetrics e-retailing Black Friday Benchmark Report.\nNo flies on those guys! Apparently they were too busy counting everyone else\u2019s clicks to pursue any of their own.\nClick image to enlarge. Black Friday e-retail sales in U.S. were up 20% over the same period last year, with consumers turning to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for their e-shopping efforts more than they ever have.\nE-retail sales at major online retailers were up 20 percent as of 3 P.M. EST this afternoon, compared to the same time on the Friday after Thanksgiving last year.\nThe survey monitors some 500 major U.S. Online retailers, and the 20 percent is in line with the 20 percent year-over-year increase IBM was reporting mid-day yesterday. However, apparently lots of folks are holding out until they\u2019ve allowed the turkey trytophan to kick in and the evening football games to start, because full-day online Thanksgiving sales ended 39 percent up over the holiday last year and they soared Thursday evening.\nMobile devices also played a much bigger role in online shopping this year, according to the benchmark. Shoppers are making 9.73 percent of their purchases from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, about the same as Thanksgiving day. And, as much as 17.37 percent of traffic to e-retail sites is coming from mobile devices, higher than even the 15.2 recorded yesterday.\nConsumer spending increased: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9 percent, with consumers pushing the average order value up from $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent.\nLuxury goods are making a comeback. Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6 percent increase in sales.\nSocial shopping. Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their favorite brands\u2019 social presence, and are turning to their social networking friends for information about deals and inventory levels.\nThough the percentage of visitors arriving from social sites is fairly small relative to all online visitors \u2014 nearly 1 percent \u2014 it\u2019s gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space.\nDepartment stores. They\u2019ve become the research engine of choice for consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over year on department store sites.\nHealth and Beauty. A reported rise of 73.1 percent in the number of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a 53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed an order.\nIn-Store Sales for Consumer Electronics and Appliances. These are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to an analytics-based forecast from IBM\u2019s Global Business Services division.\nU.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, which has led to strong pent-up demand for consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in today\u2019s economy.\nStay tuned here on the Turbo blog for other upcoming reports on the holiday season\u2019s retail tidings. It\u2019s still Black Friday, we still have the weekend, and Cyber Monday is a full three days away!\nThe weekend in sports proved to be as about as exciting as I had hoped.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Darren Clarke became the third man from that region to win a golf major in 3 of the last 6, and it was Clarke\u2019s first British Open title.\nAnd as to the U.S. Women\u2019s soccer team, they played a nailbiter of a match, but in the end the team from Japan won on penalty kicks.\nMy hat goes off to both teams. I had a whole living room full of soccer fans, and we were all nervous wrecks up to that last penalty kick that gave Japan this year\u2019s World Cup trophy.\nStill, it was an awesome game all the way around, and I wish my friends in Japan a very happy celebration. They could probably stand some good news about now!\nLater today, IBM will announces its second quarter 2010 earnings. You can check the Investor Relations site for more details.\nOn the announcement front, today saw the introduction of a new cloud-based Web analytics and digital marketing suite intended to help organizations automate online marketing campaigns across their online channels, including web sites, social media networks, and even mobile phones.\nThe new offering combines the best of Coremetrics and Unica, and provides analytics that help companies better determine the effectiveness of new products and services, fine tune their marketing campaigns, and create personalized offers in real-time across channels.\nWith 64 percent of consumers making a first purchase because of a digital experience, it\u2019s critical that marketers understand online behavior and refine their marketing activities accordingly.\nSupports deep analysis into how customers interact with a brand over time and when each marketing program is the most effective.\nUsing this technology, businesses will be able to evaluate Facebook or Twitter activity, and offer customers tailored promotions delivered to their mobile devices on the fly.\nIBM\u2019s suite also enables businesses to deliver and fine tune digital marketing programs based on what customers are doing offline.\nFor example, a consumer who purchased a new tablet in a brick-and-mortar store would receive special offers via email to purchase tablet accessories.\nThe benefit to the customer is a consistent, relevant brand experience that reflects all of their online preferences, not just what they did, read or saw on one specific site.\nThe IBM Coremetrics Web Analytics and Digital Marketing Optimization Suite is the newest addition to IBM\u2019s family of Smarter Commerce solutions,which is focused on helping companies more effectively market, sell and secure greater customer loyalty in the era of social networking and mobile computing.\nSmarter Commerce transforms how companies manage and swiftly adapt to customer and industry trends across marketing, selling and service processes that span the entire commerce cycle, putting the customer at the center of their decisions and actions.\nTo learn more about this and other marketing solutions please visit the IBM Enterprise Marketing Management site.",

Me and Xavier get along like a house on fire, as much as I like him as a coach, I also do as a person. We have a good understanding and it\u2019s a great relationship.\n\u201cSo, like I said, as an amateur I was relying a lot on reflex, movement, counter punching, but not as a pro, I\u2019m going to focus on sitting my weight down, catching shots, returning shots and working the body.\nI would love to say I can adapt to any shape or style but I have to be realistic, I would say that I\u2019m a thinking fighter, I can work out people\u2019s fight quite quickly so I can entertain different styles.\n\u201cWithout trying to sound arrogant or cocky I feel like I\u2019ve got the makings to go all the way, I feel like I\u2019m destined for great things and it\u2019s a matter of time until everyone else starts to believe it.\nIn 2018 I\u2019m just looking to get the whole experience, and I think if I could get 4 fights this year I would be happy with that, I\u2019m looking to soak up the experience and fight in front of a big hyped up crowd. I\u2019m also sparring 6-8 rounds at the moment so 4 rounds shouldn\u2019t be too bad.\nJerome Campbell makes his debut tonight on Goodwin Boxing\u2019s \u2018Venom\u2019 show at the infamous York Hall. Featuring on a strong card, Jerome is bout #6 of the evening. 4 x 3 minute rounds in the lightweight division, sharing the ring with Luke Fash.",

    "text": "Each year, there are more than 100,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S. Many of these were caused by household substances that may seem perfectly harmless to you. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won\u2019t hurt beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis.\nDepending on how a particular substance affects your dog\u2019s body and how much was ingested or inhaled, pet poisoning symptoms can include gastrointestinal and neurological problems, cardiac and respiratory distress, coma, and even death.\nDog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the opposite effect in pets. And it doesn\u2019t always take a large dose to do major damage.\nPrescription anti-inflammatory and pain medications can cause stomach and intestinal ulcers or kidney failure.\nAntidepressants can cause vomiting and, in more serious instances, serotonin syndrome -- a dangerous condition that raises temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and may cause seizures.\nDog poison No. 2: Insecticides.\nFlea and tick products. You may think you\u2019re doing your dog a favor when you apply products marketed to fight fleas and ticks, but thousands of animals are unintentionally poisoned by these products every year. Problems can occur if dogs accidentally ingest these products or if small dogs receive excessive amounts. Talk to your vet about safe OTC products.\nDog poison No. 3: Over-the-counter medications. This group contains acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen and naproxen (Advil, Alleve), as well as herbal and nutraceutical products (fish oil, joint supplements).\nDog poison No. 4: Pet medications. Just as we can be sickened or killed by medications intended to help us, cases of pet poisoning by veterinary drugs are not uncommon. Some of the more commonly reported problem medications include painkillers and de-wormers.\nDog poison No. 5: Household products, from cleaners to fire logs. Just as cleaners like bleach can poison people, they are also a leading cause of pet poisoning, resulting in stomach and respiratory tract problems. Not surprisingly, chemicals contained in antifreeze, paint thinner, and chemicals for pools also can act as dog poison. The pet poisoning symptoms they may produce include stomach upset, depression, chemical burns, renal failure and death.\nDog poison No. 6: People food. Your canine companion may look so cute as he sits there begging for a bite of your chocolate cake or a chip covered in guacamole, but not giving him what he wants could save his life. Animals have different metabolisms than people. Some foods, such as onions and garlic, as well as beverages that are perfectly safe for people can be dangerous, and sometimes fatal, for dogs.\nChocolate . Though not harmful to people, chocolate products contain substances called methylxanthines that can cause vomiting in small doses, and death if ingested in larger quantities. Darker chocolate contains more of these dangerous substances than do white or milk chocolate. The amount of chocolate that could result in death depends on the type of chocolate and the size of the dog. For smaller breeds, just half an ounce of baking chocolate can be fatal, while a larger dog might survive eating 4 ounces to 8 ounces, though 8 ounces would be extremely dagerous. Coffee and caffeine have similarly dangerous chemicals.\nAlcohol. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning in animals are similar to those in people, and may include vomiting, breathing problems, coma and, in severe cases, death.\nAvocado. You might think of them as healthy, but avocados have a substance called persin that can act as a dog poison, causing vomiting and diarrhea or worse.\nMacadamia nuts. Dogs may suffer from a series of symptoms, including weakness, overheating, and vomiting, after consumption of macadamia nuts.\nGrapes and raisins. Experts aren\u2019t sure why, but these fruits can induce kidney failure in dogs. Even a small number may cause problems in some dogs.\nXylitol. This sweetener is found in many products, including sugar-free gum and candy. It causes a rapid drop in blood sugar, resulting in weakness and seizures. Liver failure also has been reported in some dogs.\nDog poison No. 7: Chocolate. See above.\nAzaleas and rhododendrons. These pretty flowering plants contain toxins that may cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and potentially even death.\nTulips and daffodils. The bulbs of these plants may cause serious stomach problems, difficulty breathing, and increased heart rate.\nSago palms. Eating just a few seeds may be enough to cause vomiting, seizures, and liver failure.\nDog poison No. 9: Rodenticides, if ingested by dogs, can cause severe problems. The symptoms depend on the nature of the poison, and signs may not start for several days after consumption. In some instances, the dog may have eaten the poisoned rodent, and not been directly exposed to the toxin.\nDog poison No. 10: Lawn and garden products. Products for your lawn and garden may be poisonous to pets that ingest them.\nIf you think your dog has been poisoned, try to stay calm. It is important to act quickly, but rationally.\nFirst, gather up any of the potential poison that remains -- this may be helpful to your veterinarian and any outside experts who assist with the case. If your dog has vomited, collect the sample in case your veterinarian needs to see it.\nThen, try to keep your pet calm and call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at (888) 426-4435. Experts at the APCC are available to answer questions and provide guidance 24 hours a day for a $60 consultation fee. Another option is the Pet Poison Hotline with a fee of $59 per incident.\nKeep all medications, even those in child-proof bottles, in cabinets that are inaccessible to your dog. If you inadvertently drop a pill on the floor, be sure to look for it immediately. Supervise anyone, such as the elderly, who may need help taking medications.\nAlways follow guidelines on flea or tick products.\nAlthough you can safely give some ''people foods'' to your pet as a treat, others are toxic. If you have any questions about what is safe, ask your veterinarian. Or, err on the safe side and give treats made specifically for animals.\nBe sure any rodenticides you use are kept in metal cabinets or high on shelves where your pets can't find them. Remember that dogs can be fatally poisoned by eating an exposed rodent, so always be very cautious about using these products. Tell your neighbors if you put out rat bait, so they can protect their pets from exposure, and ask them to do the same for you.\nWhen buying plants for your home, opt for those that won\u2019t cause problems if your dog happens to nibble on them. The ASPCA has an online list of toxic and nontoxic plants by species.

This is part 34, to read the other parts click The Rice Field Project. If you are following this project then you might remember that we had an water well made at our land. Well as we will later build a guest bungalow on an other part of our land we had the idea to have a second water well made. The new one closer to our house and use the old one for the garden and guest-bungalow. But that did not go as easy as we thought.\nThe first try was about 5 meter from our house, they found water at 6 meter but not enough to pump it up. Second try was about 10 meter from the first water well. But no water at all was found. So a third try was done about 5 meter next to the first water well. And bingo .... water. And a lot of water.\nSo the location of the first water well was just sheer luck? Anyway we will see how it works out with 2 water wells near to each other. The job was done by the same 3 people of the first water well. And although they had to try 3 times, we only paid for 1 water well, 3.500 Thai baht + some tip for the hard work. Because yes it is hard work, especially at 30\u2103!\nUpdate : And we did just paid the final payment for the house construction. The last 5% will be paid 10 days after 100% completion and delivery of the house.",

    "text": "I\u2019ve never understood the whole points thing, scholarships, etc. for open comps. I don\u2019t do enough open comps for it to matter \u2013 but I\u2019d love to understand it. I\u2019ve tried to look it up and other than the official rules which are like reading a law-book ( in other words make no sense to me!) I can\u2019t find a simple explanation of it all. If anyone can give a layperson\u2019s explanation it would be cool!\nI had to clarify. What to which \u201cpoints\u201d was she referring, exactly?\nMaybe you are referring to being top student or top teacher in a competition or a district or in a competition series? If that is the case, what happens is you get a certain amount of points for each entry you are in (or your instructor dances), and then more points for placing higher. Like when I got top student in San Diego it was like 8 points (or something, I don\u2019t exactly remember the point value) for 1st place, 6 for 2nd, down through 6th and then 1 point for participating. You get more points for participating more and for placing higher. Your instructor gets points for the same things, but obviously if they bring more students and dance more often, they earn more points.\nSo I checked it out, not being familiar with proficiency points. No one had ever mentioned them to me before.\nEllen, I\u2019ve looked at the proficiency point guide and I\u2019m intrigued. Seems to be a complicated system to determine which category you should dance in\u2026what age, what level, as an attempt in making sure people are competing at an appropriate level \u2013 not too high or too low. It says in the guide that USA dance will make a database online of the points so I\u2019m now trying to find that. I\u2019m curious to see where I might rank. I\u2019ve always been told that the instructor decides which category you dance at. It seems like the points might be more important for high level amateur competitors or professional couples. I\u2019ll ask Ivan about it, but who knows if he knows anything about it. It does say that you can be disciplined for dancing below your level! Thanks for asking this question. I love learning more about my favorite sport! I\u2019ll keep you updated.\nThe topic sparked my interest in a number of facets of ballroom dancing that involve points and I had a big \u2018ole conversation with Ivan about it after my lesson today.\nSadly, he didn\u2019t know about proficiency points, but he did comment on another type of points used by ballroom studios which I found intriguing. Also, I did a little more research and found on http://DanceForums.com some old comments about the proficiency points. You can see the comments I found here.\nFirst, the database is not current. I don\u2019t even know if you can find it. Someone who is on the USA Dance board must have been in the conversation because he or she commented that they needed someone to volunteer to keep up with the points. I guess you are supposed to keep track of them yourself! Well, I for one, haven\u2019t been doing that.\nSecond, the link Ellen sent me on the USA Dance page that directs you to the rules about the Proficiency points is outdated. I guess there have been changes (that a couple must now only accrue 200 points instead of the 300 mentioned in the pdf file) that aren\u2019t reflected in that edition of the rules.\nBut the plot thickens. These mystery proficiency points are only applicable to USA Dance sanctioned events.\nUSA Dance isn\u2019t the only governing body of ballroom dance.\nThere are different proficiency points and rules for the National Dance Council of America (NDCA) and the Youth College Network (YCN).\nSo there are points you accrue in competition. But after my conversation with Ivan, I have learned there are also points you can accrue at a studio. Now, I don\u2019t purport to have expertise in this area because I\u2019ve never danced in a ballroom dance franchise studio. I\u2019m going on what Ivan told me. If things are different, feel free to comment below and fill us all in. At least this is what I gather went on at Ivan\u2019s studio when he was employed by a franchised studio.\nStudents accrue points and have proficiency tests to determine what level they are at: pre-bronze, bronze, silver, etc. Then packages are sold around getting to the next level. Like for every lesson you take or every figure you learn it\u2019s recorded and there are charts of points and where you are. There are also charts proclaiming which student is which level, so you can compare yourself to other students and follow your and their progress.\nTo me, this seems a bit weird. I guess it is great for goal setting and is some form of monitoring progress, but just knowing the steps in the gold syllabus doesn\u2019t necessarily, I think, mean you are a gold level dancer \u2013 meaning that you might be dancing a gold step with bronze level technique.\nWhat it does do is give a person a sense of being able to put a feather in their cap. I\u2019ve had people ask me what level dancer I am, but since I have no points or proficiency tests to go on, I honestly don\u2019t know. I have no idea what level the steps I know are considered nor my level in terms of technique.\nSeems like another VCR manual to me, but at least this one only applies to amateurs. I still don\u2019t know what this means if I\u2019m dancing Pro/Am since my proficiency in Pro/Am shall not be used in determining my amateur proficiency level\u2026.though I don\u2019t dance Am/Am, myself!\nSheesh! I think it\u2019s an interesting topic, but still kind of a mystery even after all this writing and after all the various research!\nSo, now the ball is in your court. Do you know anything about points tracked in ballroom? What do you think of these point systems? Does your studio use them? How? Have you heard of them in the context of NDCA or USA Dance? Have you kept track of yours? What do they mean\u2026.really? I\u2019m curious to know.\nOoohhh, I\u2019m a bit nervous writing this post, but I think it is a very important subject that is not often talked about. It kind of relates to my previous post about when learning to dance that you make sure you find an instructor that can teach in a way that you can understand and process. And if it\u2019s not working out, to feel free to move on to a different instructor who can suit your needs. Sometimes that can be a little tricky. One of those situations where it is easier said, than done.\nThe topic I\u2019m talking about is whether or not as a dance student we are free agents, at liberty to dance with whichever instructor we desire and the sometimes-weird possessiveness that the instructor or studio may exhibit for his/her/its students.\nWhen it all boils down, I personally believe that I am the customer, I am the one paying to learn, and I should be able to go wherever I want to do that.\nHowever, it actually isn\u2019t as black and white as that. It isn\u2019t as easy to navigate as one might think.\nHopefully you can avoid some of the difficulties I\u2019ll mention by doing \u201cdancer-views\u201d before settling on a particular instructor. I plan to write a post later on about how to go about the process of finding and selecting an instructor, so I\u2019ll leave that for another time. However, even if you do your due diligence, it may not always be possible to stay with your current instructor indefinitely. Life happens. I\u2019m with my third instructor, and in both previous cases, there were life events that pushed that change along.\nBut for now (and for what I hope is a long, long time to come) as you know from the blog, my primary instructor is Ivan, who is an independent dance instructor. He is my #1. Any place I go to take group classes or whatever (unless it is just social dancing or I\u2019m not there enough for it to matter and it\u2019s none of their business) is aware of my instructor. Conversely, Ivan is aware that I take group classes at Inna\u2019s studio, and I often inform him if I go social dancing as well, out of courtesy.\nWith Ivan, he has made it clear that if I want to dance with other instructors for ballroom, then I need to not dance with him. Coaching would be a different situation, or a lesson with Marietta or Nona as a one time deal for styling or something would be fine too, and he\u2019d know about it.\nBut if I want to learn something that he doesn\u2019t have expertise in, like West Coast Swing, or Argentine Tango, then I just have to tell him my desire and he\u2019d be cool with that. That is the arrangement we have set up. But the point is, we had a conversation about it. At no point did I go behind his back and do things. I wouldn\u2019t want to risk losing him as an instructor. We have this agreement set up and I respect it.\nSomehow, however, I\u2019ve managed to be dancing at like three different places (sometimes more), but this is not, from what I\u2019ve heard, the \u201cnorm\u201d when it comes to ballroom dancing. And if you are going to go that road, it is extremely, extremely important to be respectful of the professionals at each location, as well as their students, and the relationships between them. It is extremely, extremely important to be upfront and clear on what relationship you have to each place you dance. Otherwise, things can get very messy, very quickly!\nFrom my past personal experience, and from that of others who have shared with me, some teachers and studios can become almost possessive of their students. I can even understand it, to a point. They want to protect their business and that only makes sense. However, I feel like it comes from a scarcity mindset \u2013 the idea that the instructor or studio has to keep the student away from any other dance influences for fear that the new or different dance instructor or class may \u201csteal\u201d the student away is focused on a fear of losing something. From my perspective, it isn\u2019t possible to steal a student. If you are providing the value a student is looking for, they won\u2019t go anywhere, no matter how many \u201cother\u201d group classes they take, or instructors they are exposed to. This would be an abundant mindset.\nBut the fact is, some of the studios just don\u2019t offer everything a person might be looking for. Not everyone offers Lindy Hop, or ballet. If I can\u2019t get those at my primary studio, and I want them, I should be at liberty to go elsewhere to find them. My primary studio can always take that as feedback and grow such areas if they so desire. But to prevent me, threaten me, or guilt me into not doing more dancing if I have that desire, I feel is poor behavior. To allow myself to let any threat, or guilt deter me from what I really want is not okay either.\nHowever, there is really something to be said for sticking with one instructor or studio when its good for you, even if it is tough. Sometimes there are issues to work through, even if you adore your instructor. I\u2019ve had a lesson or two with Ivan where we had to get clear on a few things and it wasn\u2019t necessarily comfortable. But I\u2019d choose being uncomfortable and having open, honest communication, than to lose a fab instructor any day of the week. That is just me.\nAgain, as mentioned in a previous post, there isn\u2019t necessarily one \u201cright\u201d way, the be-all and end-all way of dancing. That means that each instructor you learn from will give you some similar information, and some very different information than others. This can be very confusing and muddle the clarity of your dancing. A person has to be careful of not always thinking the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It might be very green right where you are. Sticking it out with your instructor may be the best choice you ever make. Also, if you do decide to receive instruction from multiple sources, be aware that you may need to filter some of the information and make sure that you apply those things that will best serve you while leaving the rest behind. This will take discernment on your part.\nIf the time does come when you feel the need to change instructors, I\u2019d encourage you to do it in as clean, clear, and honest manner as possible. Although some people just stop taking lessons, not only can this strain your relationship with the instructor and the studio, but it steals the opportunity for the instructor or studio to respond to your issue, and even if the issue can\u2019t be amended, it robs them of the feedback you could provide so they don\u2019t recreate the same pitfall with another student.\nSo, to answer the primary question of this post, am I a free agent? Yes\u2026and no. Yes, because I take classes at a variety of places that I feel will enhance and enrich my dancing. But no, because I am very clear that Ivan is my primary ballroom instructor and I\u2019m not going anywhere else for that. I mean, the entire relationship is built on trust. You can\u2019t have trust if you are not engaging in open, honest communication or going behind someone\u2019s back. I guarantee it will show up in your dancing.\nWhat about you? Do you only dance with one instructor at one location? Why? How does that work for you? Or do you dance a lot of places? What positive or negative experiences can you share around that? What advice would you give someone who was considering dancing more than one place or changing instructors? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!",

    "text": "I figured if I could do it at all, I needed the help of the big guns. My 400mm f/2.8 lens would have worked nicely, it would allow me to zoom into the moon to fill the frame and still let plenty of light in to give me the best chance of a capture. I ran into two problems. First off, doubled \u2013 the 400mm 2.8 lens goes to 800mm f/5.6. Then, the more zoomed in you are, the more the movement of the subject in the frame. I had settled on a 1.4x extender which would get me close to 600mm with just a one stop penalty to put me at f/4.\nNext was the camera. I have a Canon Rebel 35mm film SLR that I bought on eBay for $1. It had controller issues, but thankfully the camera just so happened to work set to manual. I gave the inside a coat of urethane, set up some glass guides to hold a plate and shot it. 600mm, f/4 \u2013 ten seconds. And that\u2019s the plate you see to the right.\nFast forward ten or so months I just so happen to be interested in seeing what I can achieve with the setup again. My converted SLR has since gone missing in the attic and I really didn\u2019t want to permanently convert one of my many other 35mm film SLR cameras to wet plate. So for a few minutes I looked at the back of the camera and came up with a game plan on a plate holder that turned a 35mm camera into a wet plate camera.. And the best thing was that it was reversible. That is, if you\u2019re careful to not drip corrosive silver nitrate into the body.\nBecause the material is just a millimeter and a half thick I decided to hollow the center with no corners and then just stick corners on myself with a good metal to plastic glue. The corners themselves are cut pieces of trophy plate.\nOnce the glue was dried the holder gives a nice snug fit in the film compartment of the Canon Rebel 35mm body! I hope to get to making some images soon with it!",

    "text": "Share your tips and tricks and anything you feel important for our little community!\nwow thanks for the very nice comment and request.\nWe put this on the next to do list but of course first have to finish the 4 other routes making the Vancouver Calgary to a collectible series.\nCan you email me you Trainz username to keep your name private here.\nIf you like something see different on this website let me know also if it does what it needs to do and no overkill.\nAny other subject feel free to talk about.\nI'm having trouble with a couple of the turnouts in the Revelstoke engine terminal, specifically P01 Revelstoke C and P03 Revelstoke C. The points on 03 seem to be frozen; even though the indicator arrows switch from red to green, the points stay in the same position. Also, whenever I try to run a loco through either turnout, it derails! Close visual inspection does not reveal any immediately obvious reason for this to be happening, and I am moving at less than 10 mph with the points properly set, so I can't see that it's anything I'm doing, either. Help???\nPlS NEVER feel bad if something is not working(lucky happen very rare!) as we all know very well certain things(N3V bugs) we have no control but can repair luckily at least so i feel good when i can help.\nby tonight or tomorrow dec. 31st latest I will have a updated version of CPR Mountiain Sub and Rogers Pass both under release 1.0.2.\nIf you are interested to receive please email me on roystrainz together with information on your username so I can provide each one with a newer version.\nupdate contains replaced corrupted switches, repaired textures dissolved left and right and also a new speed and signal update.\nThe signal update will cover Viktor Lake till half way Lake Kinbasket to Donald Station.\nPlease report any missing, corrupt or not working item so we can update them in the next version end of january 2013.\nthanks for all the nice post and help to get this blog getting better and more lively. Please post any remark, suggestion, idea, wish, comment in general as llong as it is constructive and positive.\nMany thanks again and happy, happy new year!!!\nOk this morning test revealed signal 1100S is flashing yellow top left. the V2 HUD is showing green. I consider this not to bad and would accept the HUD not to be correct. The more once the train passed the signal it turned yellow for S 1095S so proofed the HUD is little bit off. Your take and please do not be shy to post something here.\nTrouble with the 1.0.2 download. I'm getting a file not found error. Possibly because the link says crp rather than cpr?\nHappy New Year to all of you!!!!!!!!\nI confirm that the download of version 1.0.2 and the installation in Trainz went as expected, ie. no problems at all.\nThanks for such good service and for such a superb route.\nThanks Gilles most other Roy's trainzers confirmed also good execution of the new release and yes works as expected, thanks for the ice comment.\nHi everyone! I want to thank Roy for an AMAZING route (I bought the 3-in-1 CPR Mountain Sub)!! The detail is ridiculous and I cannot even imagine the effort and time it took to create this route. Today I spent some time reading the new PDF instructions for the CMTM System (http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showt...7-CMTM-Upgrade) and was wondering if anyone else other than myself is crazy enough to attempt creating at least one session utilizing it. It seems like a daunting endeavor and I have no doubt that it would be an intense effort. However, I believe that a few of us dedicated enough may be able to team up and put something quite impressive together for this equally impressive route. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I especially would like Roy to chime in here too. Thanks!\nEnough industries to do the first steps with lumber industries rolling stock and truck bringing the lumber from the forest..eg.\n64WarHorse, yes, I think that there are enough industries, esp if you include the whole Mountain Sub. Not to even mention what Roy here has proposed (integrating it into his upcoming additional route(s)). CMTM does support all sorts of cool scenarios as mentioned by Roy, not just yard/switching duties specifically. I am in the process of learning the new CMTM version (v.4) and would gladly contribute as much time/effort that I can to developing some sessions if we do it in a team fashion. :) Maybe we can start small at first and make some very basic sessions/scenarios to see how it goes. If all works out well then we can collaborate and come up with some truly epic sessions for these awesome routes! This idea is very exciting for me and if some of you share my enthusiasm (esp Roy), I really think we could build something legendary here. Idk. Maybe we can pull DAP (CMTM creator) into this somehow too.\nOkay, colour me intrigued. So where do we start? I suppose the first question would be, do we need to modify any rolling stock for CMTM?\nThis is the most expensive ad-on I have ever bought, but I consider it worth every penny.\nKeep the spirit high. :) I really look forward to following the devlopment of Your project.\nSteve i agree i will tell Ray to change the background in a neutral easy to read color monday! promise!\nChrisD yeeeehhh wow that feels good you like it as so many did already before you and yes it is a marvel and yes worth every penny you spent There is so much to discover it will take you a lot of time to find out and still not see it all,........that means yes i spent a lot of time creating this and hope to finish the next section soon.\nRailworks user here that just had to see what Trainz was capable of in its most extreme! Picked up Trainz on 75% discount and bought the Rogers Pass route from your site. The level of detail in this route is amazing. Im a routebuilder in Railworks, and I know how long it takes to build anything. I cant imagine it being any different in Trainz.. Your work is really and I mean really fantastic! Its all in the details as they say and your route has it all. Take care all and thanks again for your hard work Roy!\nHello all! Sorry for the few days absence but I've been quite busy lately. Anyway, I am almost done reading and re-reading the CMTM documentation and would soon like to start collaborating with those of you interested in helping me out with some basic CMTM session ideas and subsequently creation. All of those interested should PM me on the main Trainz forums thread and send me their e-mail addresses so we can communicate more efficiently. Or, feel free to e-mail me directly at runthat1@gmail.com.\nsaw that one too1 I did straighten a track segment and did not realize the signposts were separate and so got this cosmetic error. Moved the post and fixed already, thanks for reporting.\nThank you for this nice route it is wel very long to drive cpr mountain sub -)) my wife is killing me.\nGuillaume, i cannot advice you what is a less of more painful death, killed by your wife or trainz excitement, lol.\nThanks 4 sharing, Ning laughs she understand.\nHopefully this will work in TS12, seeing errors as I install, previous versions errors, warnings. All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the routes!\nall related to JVC grass items by author jankvis.\nmissing deps or unknown deps 99% of the time are caused by to many cdp's installed at the same time in Content Manager Program! So if jankvis has unknown ora ny other look for the author and reinstall that group like here for Jankvis go to group 3 dependencies you downloaded and reinstall the group J in there, should work flawless honest.\nhmm working in my dungeon on Mount Stephens/Spirals/Lake Louise area Laggan sub.....sssst top secret.\n\"Roy, the screenshots of the Mountain Subdivision are phenomenal. Have you done the whole thing to absolute scale? What sources did you use (or are you a railroader)? What version of Trainz will this run on and are there related kuids included?\"\nLike Google real scale and detail as far as possible.\nRunning TS12 latest version 49922.\nThanks a million Roy! You are a wonderful and patient support. Everything is up and going, beautifully! Now for that latte, sit back, relax and enjoy.\nThursday Feb 27th I will upload release 1.03 of the CPR Mountain Sub. Claim yours by sending an email to me and i will link an upload for you. Have a great week!\ndid you have any succes implementing the CMTM system for our routes? let us know what the current status is ok?\nHello! Sorry for the lack of updates, but I was out-of-state enjoying Mardi Gras in New Orleans for a few weeks. :) But yes, CMTM DOES work with the routes and it works quite well actually. I had started to collaborate with another member here but he hasn't replied to my last e-mail. He had some VERY good session ideas which I was excited to work on with him. He had suggested doing multiple CMTM sessions, each one building upon the previous one(s). I will attempt to contact him again. Otherwise, I, myself, have begun testing CMTM implementation on the CPR Mountain Sub route (3-in-1) and am now trying to come up with some of my own session ideas. If ANYONE else here would like to help, PLEASE contact me via e-mail or PM on the forums.\nMardi Gras that has been a while for me.... very nice time!\nWell CMTM that sounds good, let me know when you have something for me to test here and give ideas to you as feedback. If lucky not to long we have a connection to the Laggan sub to run real CMTM!\nKeep up the excellent work and keep me in the pict.\nCPR Mountain Sub release 1.0.3 is ready for dl.\nemail me and I open in your account for dl!\nHello all! I must apologize for the delay in providing any updates regarding implementing CMTM 4 on the CPR Mountain Sub. I am just starting to get over a nasty bout with bronchitis/upper respiratory infection and have not been able to devote much time to Trainz or much else aside from sleep (and coughing my lungs out). Steve (I am now unsure of his Trainz username here) contacted me awhile ago about his interest and desire to help me get some CMTM sessions thought-out and started. I will be contacting him later today to continue to work out the details of some of his ideas (which are really awesome btw!!). Not going to ruin the surprise or anticipation, but due to the route's huge size and unique layout of industries, yards, and portals to subsequent routes that Roy has mentioned, the sessions Steve has suggested as some possibilities really do a great job of taking those factors into account.\nRoy, yes!, CMTM 4 can and DOES work with the route(s) and YES!, it should definitely be something you take into consideration for future updates, upgrades, and new routes/expansions. Steve and I both came to the same conclusion that adding CMTM to existing rolling stock is a very simple matter of just adding some lines to the config.txt files. However this poses a potential problem with the original content creators' licensing/hosting mandates. I am not sure what to do about this potential issue, but I am sure we will find a way.\nkep up the good work guys, i work hard to get the daunting task of texturing over and over again certain areas to my liking but as i get older (like all of you) every day, day by day I get more picky and say to myself time is not of the essence, quality, pride of work and fun of doing it makes the difference.\nif this continues I close the blog and concentrate only on supporting you guys my unbelievable nice cosy and great roys trainz family. SP1 is the door closer for me with trainz although I will support you guys to the end of the 5 major routes for the next years to come and look seriously for another alternative than N3V.\ni not understand what fun they have spamming this blog. there is no financial gain nor fight or dispute of any kind related unless they show their face like we do.\nugly but it seems to make them happen.\nGarbage not only fills our oceans and kills habitat.\nI just finished testing a way around the grotesque bug existing for years far as TRS 2009 and now even blocking my routes from working with tunnels.\nIt is not a copmplete guarantee it should work now for you to so pls dl it and test it once I uploaded only CPR marked as 57720_CPR. i not upgrade any smaller route instead I will teach you how to spli them yourselves from a certain release for your own enjoyment. Kepp all routes updated is to much work right now and easier to split the biog one local at your desk.\nYess, they failed to block me here is a version that will work at least it does on my computer 57720! I will now start prep upload for the route with tunnels working but its new tunnels not the old one i did change little things in the config too of the tunnels.\nOk just uploade the latest CPR version working with big tunnels in 57720 SP1 and also uploade the 577203rdparty_fix for deps new tunnels you need to dl again. sorry for the incovenience but thank N3V for all the mishap and fuzz they create and deny.\nI am not sure how to update my Rogers Pass to SP1. Please advise.\nNiels send me an email and acc namr and see what we can do ok?\nMaybe You should take a look at Open Rails when You get a few moments to spare.\nThis is where I have moved after giving up on TS12 and its \"Service Pack\".\nThis freeware Train Simulator (at 0.8 rev 1561) uses at present existing MSTS Routes, but is running on 4 cores and is revised several times each week.\nBug reporting and fixing is a breeze compared to N3V, and the team even works for nothing.\nVisual range from the CAB, where I am supposed to be when I drive a train, is 4 Km\u00b4s and can be set even higher If You want to, but 4 Km\u00b4s is GREAT sustaining a 100+ frame rate.\nThe driving experience is CLASSES Higher than Trainz.\nSorry for rubbing salt in Your wound, but my wound is just as great thanks to N3V, and You said in a previous post that You might change platform.\nJust wanted to let you know that after a fresh install of TS12 SP1 and CPR Mountain Sub 57720 I am simply amazed.\nNever before have I been able to run with 5000MT draw successfully. Usually I cannot even open up the CPR as it locks up my computer. I have never been able to run it with all sliders maxed out but with TS12 SP1 and CPR 57720 I have no problems.\nThe graphics are a huge improvement as is the sound.\nIn fact the only minor issue I have is a slight stutter when the scenery detail slider is on normal or high with the other sliders at max value. Smooth as silk if scenery detail is on low. this is unheard of on my humble computer. I will play with the slider settings a little more as I am sure there is a better compromise re the stutter.\nI have kept the TS12 pre SP1 install just in case, but I am really loving the 57720 version so much.\nI will report back after testing in a heavy yard area and with other trains about.\nThat's all for now, Andrew.\nsorry to hear you leave.\nWell if Open rails has a modeller similar to trainz or better, if the dbase of 3rd party freeware objects to choose from is similar or better, if there is a way to \"move\" \"recreate the same DEM, networks, road,splines and locations of existing objects ....what else.\nI know the problem, and there is no easy solution.\nAs for the assets, there may be a way forward. Most assets are built with some kind of 3D modeller, and if the raw files (before export to Trainz) is at hand they can be exported to MSTS as well.\nI am sure we will never get to a quater of a million assets, but right now N3V is voiding a batch of these, so..\nI not need all dls items so far 400 are faulty in my trainz dbase. ouch but can live with it for the moment.\nthanks for your support dear friend say hello home from all of us!!\nNew version of CPR Mountain Sub TS14 release 1.0.5 now available.\njust uploaded the 1.0.5 release which runs very nice and is the best ever driver version so far in 10 years! Scenery and quality is beyond expectations and a complete surprise probably for N3V too they never check or report things anyway.\nOGL is now finally the way to go and has better fps too when tweaking your Nvidia.\nPersonally I am most happy with driver as the speedtrees and my textures now do VERY well!!!\nI just made a free roam around Your route and the memory usage peaked at 2,454,000 Kb, so Trainz definately uses more than the usual 2 Gb. And, no locking or long thinking pauses.\nRoy, thanks again, I have donwloaded all 1.0.5, do I need all these if I have the previous version?\nIf you dl already earlier revs deps you not need to dl again same.\nChris thanks for the link it seems to work better than expected!\nIs there a way to undo the 4GB patch? My trainz.exe file is changed, cannot apply patch #2. Thanks.\nyou run into the same booby trap too like me.\nCurrently i make some backups of older TS212 versions to an old HDD but a slow one. After done I will than carefully upgrdae another 57720 on my SSD and install same way you do.\nI lost my major HDD backup disk incl my original TS12 files from trainz setup. Not in the mood now to see if i can dl them again from trainz... Maybe when we finished supplying N#V with all the bugs they will fix them for the next TS14 for sure and use us as their testers like always.\nthere is and never will be a rollback from them so when goes wrong you have to uninstall reinstall crazy but true as far as I know.\nkeep me us posted and you can post in roy doors thread so other can learn from it.\nThat is Your original file. Just delete the Trainz.exe and rename tha backup.\nOk guys this evening uploaded tons of kuids upgraded to trainz build 3.5 to be used in TS12 49922 and 87898.\nIf your interested dl the 5 groups on the deps page of your profile.\nRoy, just found your website by chance, looked at your route pics. they are the best I've seen. You are an artist.\nFor all those using the CPR Mountain freeware route with s301 ZR grasses which unfortunately not do the job at all. I did replace them today but the route is not updated yet.\nHere is a way to use replace assets and you can dl via your profile the Pofig-JVC frewware cdp with the grasses needed.\nI did work on a proper replacement for the S301 grasses for the freeware grass version of the CPR route.\nI thought that those from jvc in the pofig lib could do the job till one decides to change/upgrade to ST_2 grasses if he/she likes them more.\nfind near track following item \"ZR~(Gr-1)Grass R-Dark green-2 mtr\"\nopen in surveyor main menu replace assets and place this object in left side as assets to replace!\nclick current selection only to make it replace all in the route!\n\"3D1_Pg-JVC_gr1_22\" is asset to replace with!\n3D1_Pg-JVC_gr2_58 asset to replace with!\nIn case you are not familiar with I can make tomorrow a short video how to but bet you know this command how to use.\nRoy, a query please. I am in the process of writing a Session for CPR to be uploaded (hopefully) to the DLS.\nI have the freeware S301 grasses at the moment. If I replace them with the 3D1 grasses does your map still retain your kuid?\nIf I upload a Session with S301 grasses will other players with other versions of grasses still be able to download and play a Session from the DLS?\nI not have experience with creating sessions to that level of detail how trainz would handle it bit from the surveyor handling this it should work as long as the other side has the same grass it will show that grass.\nMost probably the session would have missing deps (grasses) if the other party not have those grasses in his/her dbase.\nWe have to test this and see or discuss with other more experienced session users on the forum.\nThe eeasiest and most forward way for you however would be to make these grasses Gr... now used mandatory to dl and install when someone dl your session.\nI have never used Replace Assets before so I'm not sure if it also replaces your kuid with mine for the map. That would be no good to upload a Session to the DLS.\nI'll play safe for the moment and keep to the S301 grasses until my Session is released. After that I can experiment.\nI think you are right in that another player would have missing deps but that should'nt affect the playability of the Session.\nBTW, what is the correct spelling. Illecillweat or Illecillwaet? Both are used in the map. I would like to know the correct one for use in html messages.\nBefore you release any session on the dls make sure that not inadvertedly parts of the payware route are linked or available thru the session on the dls.\nI never used sessions in depth but I think i saw once a large route file linked in the sessions data file that was the major part of the route.\nThis we have to avoid you understand.\nReplace asset is easy and handy so pls use it and let me now the new grasses do the job.\nIllecillewaet is the correct name.\nI understand your concerns about people getting hold of your route through other means. That will not happen with me. I shall be uploading 2 files to the DLS when ready. One is the Session and the other is a HTML file which will contain the instructions, messages, etc.\nNothing of your route is included apart from your kuid in the Session config.txt that gives the map being used. What this means is that if someone hasn't bought the route and downloads the Session, they won't be able to play it as the route will be a 'Missing Dependency'.\nWith your permission I'll add into the DLS description that the Session uses a Payware route only available from you at Roy's Trainz. You never know, it might bring in a few extra sales! If someone has already bought the route then everything is peachy.\nI've started the Session at Revelstoke CPR Yard and have now reached Illecillewaet (correct spelling thanks).\nI'll tidy up here and save a backup to external HD before I try replacing the grasses.\nthanks for the nice post and agree with you.\nSorry for the late approval of the post.\nMy webmaster adviced me to go this cumbersome way to approve outside posts since hackers/spammers keep bombarding the website relentlessly what fun they think they have is unclear to me but this world has more unclear habits and things happening.\nThanks for the reply. I agree with you, these hackers are a menace.\nI installed the grasses ok but what I feared would happen, did. I could only save them in a new map with my kuid. This of course is no good as I need to upload a Session for use with your map, your kuid.\nWhat I think I'll do is to continue on to Wakely and stop there. I'll upload the Session and explain that it can only be played with your S301 map. I'll wait and see if there is any positive interest/feedback before deciding whether to carry on to Golden.\nDon't bother replying to this post. I'll put future posts on the Forum and let N3V worry about the hackers.\nIf you go into the config of your session and change the route map the session refers to than, anyone who has the CPR in any form but different grasses eg should be able to run the route/session.\nWhen you have a test for me i can proof what I say when you ready.\nI have done this dozen times when a session linked to an older CPR version I wanted to link to a newer, changed the config map kuid the session has to run on and done.\nI understand what you mean when updating Sessions but this is your own kuid on your own computer and Trainz recognises this.\nWhen I replaced the grasses I can only save it in my kuid which Trainz gives me, like it or not.\nFor instance: your map 122860:100035, after installing and saving the new grasses has now become 90608:100027, the 90608 being my kuid.\nThis is fine as long as I don't want to upload the map to anywhere. It may now be in my kuid but doesn't belong to me.\nI think the way to go is to release the Session with the default map 122860:100035. I will add an instruction on how to change the map kuid in the Session to whatever they have on their system. This will not infringe your copyright as any player must have bought your original map before they can update grasses.\nAll very complicated so I'll leave that for now until I get the Session finished.\nI'll come back to you at that time to see about testing.\ndefying 58414 little critters and bugs the Rogers Pass passed my QA tests with \"flying colors\" after crashing first time after 2 hours without any normal reason than the exisitng Trainz bug.\nThe route is now ready for dl for those interested in a 58414 1.07 version of this section.\nAbout wich trainz TS12 versions support my routes. Simple and straight forward ALL releases work 100% and dependencies of the route are all working and links for dl provided. It cannot be more simple and all in one place.If for any reason you feel well with the 49922 version dl this one from your account profile.I use the 58414 as the driver here runs particularly well, but earlier versions no problem.\nCan i ask what the file size is for the whole Route please Roy ?, Like to download the whole thing mate i am on a limited wireless service here and it would take for ever to download if the Route and Deps is too big. And does it only come in a winter version ?. Loks pretty cool the whole thing.\nsorry I just now checked the blog to see for comments that need approval. Many times hackers and sorts of try to ruin one's day and for unknown reason and sick pleasure that never works at least not with us.\nOk the size of the entire route is a cdp/zip 199 MB! not that big even for a limited internet connection and my site has fast acces so dl would work fine.\nThe deps are all grouped in smaller ones and also setup to fit as you said ltd acces internet connections.\nI am very pleased to see you around here and we would be more than happy to welcome you to our community. You will love it and yes the winter/seasonal groundtextures for a auto pre and post winter experience is included.\nCheck my thread there are somewhere also winterpictures around.\nThis should get you on the tracks with Roy's trainz.\nThanks Roy i'll certainly grab it at sum stage mate, Few other projects i want to take care of first though so thanks again.\nHate to be a pain again mate sorry but can i ask one more question, If i have not updated to the latest patchs for TS12 can i still use your Route ?. Or would i have to patch to the latest build ?. Thanks Roy.\nyes when you purchase my routes it will show you what to dowload for eg. 49922 WIN and MAC version and in case the 58414 release the coresponding CPR route working/updated for the version of TS12.\nAlso I did \"update a lot of built-in and other used cdp's to actualize them as far as feasible to run well on 58414.\nthese routes look awesome, i'm currently downloading alot of stuff for other software and will buy CPR Mountain Subdivision in a couple of hours. I hope the download includes everything needed to run the route because i'm new to Trainz12. Thank You Roy for your work of Art :) Harry from Montreal, Canada.\nyou make my birthday a complete success. thanks for the very nice comment.\nWelcome to Roys Trainz and YES there is one page containing ALL needed deps at your fingertips.\nOMG, WOW! Roy you're awesome! I just finished installing \"Rogers Pass\" and I am in shock at how beautiful the route looks in TS12. Your payware even looks better than Railworks TS2014......BRAVO!\nDo you remember if I have all the routes when I bought the $70 combo? If not, which one do I not have? Curious, thank you for all your hard work and beautiful creative things.\nThe 3 in combo means that you bought the CPR Mountain Sub from Ottertail all the way to west of Revelstoke.\nI made for a limited time 3 separate \"smaller\" routes cutting/overlapping with the huge CPR MOUNTAIN connecting them via Iportals.\nThe \"smaller 3 sep routes\" where temporarily I want to allow people to taste at \"entry\" level before deciding to go for the big one.\nSome users liked the smaller ones to run a few hours i.o. of 9 up all day.\n99% bought and uses the CPR MOUNTAIN SUB.\nI did not anticipate so much work due to several bugs in any trainz version when cutting. Imagine eg deleting a baseboard does not mean all data within and crossing is deleted and you and up with \"invisble floating elements\" ouside your cut route.\nthis morning Richard post on my trainz forum threads very touching post indeed!\n\"Hi Roy and everyone else who views this thread.\n5 days ago I had been in Trainz exile for around 4 years. If I am totally honest I didn't think I would ever take an interest in Trainz again having drifted onto other things. On Sunday afternoon I stumbled across The Kickstarter Project \"Trainz Simulator - A New Era\". Initially I made a modest pledge, I liked the idea and the more I read about it, the more my interest in the future of Trainz was growing. The fire was lit and within a few hours I was back on the Kickstarter page increasing my pledge. At this point I was going to take a back seat and strap myself in for the ride and watch the next 4 weeks unfold. It didn't stop there though, I still couldn't stop at pledge number 2. I decided I needed a bigger slice of the action and pledge number 3 was made within 24 hours of me starting all this. Having got this far and making a commitment to the future of Trainz it was time to dust down my last version of the game Trainz 2009 and take a look. I had remembered fondly how much I enjoyed Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 along with Trainz classics, although if I am honest winding the clock back 4 years and looking at Trainz 2009 did little to enhance my new found enthusiasm for the Trainz Kickstarter project.\nTaking the above into consideration it was time to research the current version of trainz and try and establish what the best available routes for Trainz 12 were. This is where I stumbled across Roys Trainz and after browsing his site and the forums I knew instantly I wasn't going to wait for my Get Trainz Now selection from the Kickstarter Pledge. I bought Trainz 12 along with CPR-Mountain-Sub TS14 and It's one of the best decisions I have ever made.\nThe Route is absolutely stunning Roy and is a credit to you.\nI look forward to seeing your work hit new heights in future versions of trains.\nain't that something wow feels good and gives lots of energy.\nThe day after Dec.17th we all feel much better KS first step reached and more streched goals will make it for sure.\nThanks all the trainzers who supported vie my website and of course all those that pledged on the official KS and trainz website!!!\nFor those new to my website asking how come this blog is not very active, the reason is simple we use the main Trainz forum my trheads and thus reach at the same time other trainzers not part (yet) of the Roy's Trainz family.\nIf you like to share on my threads that you pledged also thru my routes please post over there and here of course.\nI respect eachothers privacy and not publish a list.\nHappy Holidays and Happy New Trainz year and 2014!\nwilliam asked me today in an email if my routes work on TS 12 he bought from steam.\nYes all my routes work on TS12 and all versions, see on this website when you click more on the CPR Mountain Sub it show TS12 version number and windows and or MAC version number.\nWell, finally we did it the Laggan sub section West is ready to download.\nfurther posts and comments we do as usual on the trainz forum in my threads Canadian rocky Mountains 2011 and others i opened there.\n\"I just downloaded the Columbia River Basin and it is the most amazing, most detailed route in trainz! It took me in a CP ES44AC running at track speed almost 3 hours to get done! of course I met 2 trains along the way and had to follow a northbound CN grain, but it was amazing! Super fun, super realistic, and totally worth the $25! Every person that has trainz 12 download this now!!!!\"\nMid summer for most on this globe activity still high on roystrainz!! Most users know this blog is kind of sleepy as most activity blog etc is on trainz forum so please follow up over there to avoid double traffic.\nAt this moment i try to solve a mysterious bug on a beautiful very intelligent way of session automated traffic for CPR Mountain Sub created by my good dutch fellow friend Henk. His sessions works flawless on his computers but mine seem to love to bug a few AI trains so this and next week i will try to re-create his work from scratch and will keep you guys updated on the results. In case you are interested in the results email me or post on my threads on trainz forum.\nWell we did it and cleared all winter tracks into Ottertail and further to Viktor Lake. Now ready for download is the all NEW CPR MOUNTAIN SUB SEASONAL with 4 seasons and much more and yes for future TANE use ready to migrate to that level when they are ready. In the mean time you can enjoy this gem the fullest in TS12 and maybe appreciate more now that TS12 with the so many shortcomings still is a nice piece of sim. It is sad to say how people ravage over TANE CE a not finished product (never should be released) as most trainzer have no clue what it takes to get a finished product until the final day of official release.\nSo i released yesterday some 300 plus seasonal assets. you will find them on the download page when you have bought the CPR Mountain Sub 1.0.9 look for the route 1.0.9 seasonal.\nStill some more to do but that is for later now finish the TANE speedtrees first release for my routes.\nWell at least the curtain starts moving in the TANE 3D theatre announcing wazz up and coming \"soon\". Yes they start with the Columbia River Basin followed by all the other one's all new routes so much bigger,wider,more details than ever before and much much more to come all in super realistic mode and not to forget protypical!!\nOnce all routes in TANe are out there the TS12 routes will fade out slowly and close an era we all enjoyed so much. You can post here but I prefer you do on my Canadian Rocky Mountains thread in the trainz frorum. A little bit more patience to iron out little critters and cracks by the N3V crew. they have a mountain of routes from me to get ready so give them credit and energy to get things done the soonest and well.\nGlad Roy is still up and kickin'!!!",

That means that if you donate \u00a35 Best Beginnings it will be worth \u00a310, \u00a310 becomes \u00a320 all the way up to \u00a35,000!\nHere is a short film, that explains how your support will make a difference presented by Best Beginnings Ambassador and TV presenter Charlie Webster, filmed on November 17th 2010 at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College in London.\nWe hope you have enjoyed the film and feel inspired to support the Small Wonders project for the UKs most vulnerable babies. Please go to www.biggive.org.uk/donate/bestbeginnings and donate at 10 a.m. Monday December 6th and your donation will go twice as far.\nCharlie Webster isn't the only celebrity looking forward to having her donation doubled by The Big Give.

    "text": "\u00a9 2019 Thurlow Church of England (VC) Primary School.\nAs a Local Authority Maintained school Suffolk County Council is responsible for co-ordinating the admission arrangements for the normal year of entry at a school.\nChildren enter Thurlow CE VCP School during the academic year in which they have their fifth birthday. We have a Pupil Admission Number (PAN) of 15.\nMost children transfer from local pre-schools and close liaison takes place between these establishments and with parents before children start school. This enables pre-school knowledge to be passed on to Early Years staff at Thurlow CE VCP and ensures that we have a very clear picture of a child\u2019s needs before they start.\nAt Thurlow CE VCP we aim for all children to feel confident and happy from their first day at school. During the summer term before they enter, Early Years children and parents are invited to taster sessions. Children and parents join in with activities led by Early Years staff and this really aids a smooth transition into school life as well as giving parents ideas of things they can do with their child at home.\nA meeting for all new parents of children about to start in Early Years is held in the summer term.\nProspective and new parents are encouraged to attend the taster sessions and parent meetings that the school organises. This enables parents to find out through first-hand experience how children learn at Thurlow CE VCP School. If you would like to visit the school please contact the school office (01440 783281) to make an appointment.\nOur Nursery children learn alongside our reception children in a purpose built learning environment. Nursery sessions are 5 days a week (mornings) and the sessions run from 8:50 until 11:50. Children between the ages of 2-4 are welcome if funded.\nWe have a maximum of 13 places for our Nursery sessions during the school year. Either 5 sessions 8.50-11.50 or 3 sessions 8am-1pm. Applications for places are considered each term, with priority being given to the oldest children. To apply for a place in our nursery, please request an application form from the School Office. Please complete the form and return it to school. The school will need to see the birth certificate of the child and this information will be recorded on the application form. We have three intakes per year. Eligible two year olds can join the nursery in the term after they turn two; three year old children can join the nursery in the term after they turn three.\nEnquiries regarding applying for a place at our Nursery can be made via the School office \u2013 01440 783281. Please note that applications for entry in to our Reception year will need to be made via the Suffolk Schools admission even if your child attends our nursery and a nursery place does not guarantee a place at the school.",

    "text": "An autobiography of Fran Drescher.\nGreat surprise today with the mail!! I didn't expect the book to arrive this soon! Thanks for sending it, FamFatale!!! I'm looking forward to read it!!.\nI hope your book will arrive soon too!!!\nLeft the book in Switserland with a friend who wanted to read it too. After she's finished with it, the book will come back to me so I can read it myself.\nHave fun reading it, Irene!!\nSo, E-mile, the book comes back to you in Holland and thanks again!\nFran is back!!!! My friend from Switserland send me the book back; so now I can read it myself. She realy liked it, so I'm even more eager to read it than I already was!!!\nI just loved the book!!!!!\nFran tells her story with such humor.\ngood reading material it is.\nAgain thanks for the book, FamFatale!!\nAnd there was interest for a bookring! Today Fran will go to the first person in the ring: Arja.\nHave a safe and wonderful journey, Fran!!!\nE-mile mentioned this book and I thought it'd be interesting to read more about Fran's life. Might take a few weeks, as I suddenly had a pile of ring books arrive at the same time.\nI never realized how many other shows and films Fran Drescher must have worked on, before and during The Nanny. Also, I had not expected her to be so obnoxious and eccentric all the time in her behaviour and writing. IMHO this gets a bit annoying, even though that is who she is (or how she wants to present herself).\nE-mile, can you please tell me who to send the book to next?\nGister in de brievenbus gekregen via Arja. Hartelijk bedankt voor het langsbrengen. Ben er meteen in begonnen, was speciaal even in niets nieuws begonnen omdat ik wist dat ie eraan zat te komen. Ben benieuwd. Leuk dat het boek helemaal uit de US komt!\nWhat a lovely book to read and nice photo's too! Very funny. A real feel-good-story as far as I'm concerned, really liked it.\nShe sounds gratefull for the carrier she has and doesn't take her success for granted. I'll enjoy the episodes of The Nanny even more now I know the whole history and details behind it!\nI will bring the book to Tiekie this week asap.\nGot this book today from Pietenpadje. I am very looking forward to reading this book, so I will move my other books to a dark place and settle down tonight! Thank you E-mile for this lovely ring-book!!\nI am sending this book to the next person on the list. I have got no time to read it and I don't want to keep it here for too long.\nFran arrived on my doormat today!\nI'm really looking forward to reading this book.\nThanks for sending it Tiekie, and perhaps you can still read it after me?\nBy the way, nice to know that this book comes all the way from America!\nFinished it and what a fun book to read!\nAt times I really had to laugh out loud. And it's really written in her voice, literally... you actually hear her saying all these sentences!\nThe only thing that was nagging me whilst reading the book was the way she talked about her husband and her wonderful marriage... soon after this book was published they got divorced!!\nMaybe she wrote about that in her second book? I guess I have to read that as well!\nI'll contact Tiekie to ask if she has time to read it now, otherwise this book will be off to muizz.\nFran is on her way to Muizz!\nSorry for the late journal entry. I found the parcel in a stack of mail when I came home from a couple of days abroad and then I forgot to register it. Luckily Mirre sent me a reminder that she hadn't heard wether the book has arrived. Well, it has! Probably it will take some time before I am able to read it, because there are some other books screaming for attention as well.\nThanks for ringing the book, and Mirre, thanks for sending the book and for the reminder.\nImagine you are at a dinner party and the woman sitting next to you doesn't stop talking. She keeps on talking about her career, clothes, celebrities she's met, clothes, her succesful television show, clothes, her apearance at David Letterman shows and how funny she was there, clothes, etc. You don't want to be impolite and you make some encouraging noises, and in the mean time you are looking for a place to hide.\nThat's how I felt when reading this book. Normally I love (auto)biographies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Someone who is able to spend 6 pages about the preparations for a photo shoot (how her make up, hair and clothes were) can't keep my interest. I'm really sorry. Needless to say that I didn't finish this book.\nNow the book will continue its journey. It'll go to Sarana.\nWhat a lovely and funny book! I've read it while spending the Easter weekend with my parents and I kept calling out to them \"Ooo, did you know that...\" and \"You've got to hear this...\". I had no idea that so much about The Nanny was based on Fran's own life. I loved her stories, especially the down-to-earth-ness of them, and the fact that she wasn't afraid to tell her silliest stories or show her most unflattering pictures... A very sympathetic woman, as far as you can tell through this book.\nI'm shocked to read in Mirre's Journal Entry that she's divorced now, the way she describes her marriage it's hard to believe that it fell apart soon afterwards!\nThanks for ringing the book, E-mile! I'm PM'ing Nandaaah now.\nEdit: I'm terribly sorry for the long delay, the book was mailed out today.\nAnd the book has arrived, just started in another, so I'll probably start in this book somewhere in the next week.\nI've finished the book today in the hot sun. It was an O.K. book to read.\nJust as Arja, I didn't know she did this many other shows and films. And too bad she divorced, since her mariage seems good in the book, but unexpecting things can happen. The book will be off to the next reader as soon as I got an adress to send it to.\nAnd I got the book now! Thanx Nandaaah for sending it and E-mile for ringing (?) it. I allready started in it because my last book was just finished. Fun to know that her parents and sister's names in the Nanny came out off real life. That Chester was her dog, I knew allready. I will try to finish it before the Castricum-meeting.\nGelukt! Geweldig van genoten! En nu The Nanny weer op tv is kijk ik toch met *iets* andere ogen. Bedankt voor het ringen E-mile. Ze komt morgen bij je terug.\n\"What I learned about myself, the depth of my relationships, and cancer -tests, treatment, recovery and follow-up- could fill a book. So here it is.\n* back to E-mile. <-- Fran is back home!!!!\nposted Fran today, so the ring can continue..\nFran has arrived in Gouda! I'm looking forward to reading this book and am pleased to see it has pictures in it! Is has been a while since I read a book containing pictures.\nHi guys, perhaps you already know it, but since a few weeks there is another comedy on RTL4 on sunday afternoon with/about Fran!! I saw it for the first time last sunday and wanted to let you know that it's out there.\nNa 'The Nanny' is Fran Drescher terug met een nieuwe komedie. In 'Living with Fran' is Fran een gescheiden vrouw die geniet van de nieuwe weg die haar leven is ingeslagen. Haar nieuwe liefde Riley is fantastisch, geweldig en jong, heel erg jong. Hun relatie is ingewikkeld vanwege het feit dat de kinderen van Fran bijna even oud zijn als hun nieuwe 'stiefvader'. Het nieuwe huishouden van Fran mag dan niet traditioneel zijn en soms heel lastig, toch weet ze zeker dat ze het niet anders zou willen doen.\n'Living with Fran', vanaf zondag 11 juni, 17.00 - 17.30 uur, RTL 4.\nToday Fran arrived at my doormat, together with 2(!) other books...Which makes the count of ringbooks that arrived here in 3 days: 7...I think I'll need to ask my boss for a reading leave-of-absense.\nAnyway, although not all the stories were equally entertaining I enjoyed reading the book. It was really written in her voice, like Mirre said!\nI can't wait to read the other book!\nThanks for re-opening the ring E-mile!\nI'll send it to Yinny asap!\nFound it in the mailbox yesterday!\nThank you, E-mile for sharing this book and Enitnaj for sending this book!\nYes, she is boasting about all the famous people she met, the people she knows, the clothes she wears, blablabla. But she does it so innocently, so charming, that it isn't (very) annoying.\nThis book is already on its way to the next reader.\nThe book is here! I'll start reading it right away, because the book I'm currently reading is not to my taste.\nThe book is badly damaged, I'll try to repair some of it.\nI never watched the Nanny because I dislike sitcoms and canned laughter, but this book was neat. Miss Drecher sure has a lot of energy!\nThanks for the sweet card you left me in the book Yinny! I'll keep using it as a bookmark.\nI'm mailing this book to Redfloor today. Happy reading!\nLag in mijn brievenbus. Ben heel erg benieuwd ernaar. Er zijn nog wel enkele boeken die eerst aan de beurt zijn. Dutch-flybabe, je hebt het keurig gerestaureerd! Dank ook voor de kaart.\nEdit: Ere wie ere toekomt, Dutch-flybabe heeft het boekje gerestaureerd, niet Yinny.\nWat een leuk boek om te lezen. Allereerst door het formaat. Het is een lekker kleine pocket met kleine letters. Het paste makkelijk in mijn tas, zelfs als deze al vol zat. Daardoor kon ik doorlezen in de trein. Alle boeken zouden in dit formaat verkrijgbaar moeten zijn.\nDaarnaast is het ook gewoon heel erg leuk om te lezen over het leven van een van mijn favoriete actrices. Heel grappig om te lezen dat haar eigen ouders ook Sylvia en Morty heten en dat er meer parallellen zijn. Fijn dat Fran uiteindelijk een succesvolle carriere heeft. Ik bekijk de Nanny nu met heel andere ogen. Ik ben benieuwd naar deel twee, al vermoed ik, gezien de inhoud, dat dat deel lang niet zo hilarisch zal zijn.\nHaven't read it yet but will so very soon. Thanx for sending it Redfloor!\nFran is on her way to Jordanne. Have fun!!\nI found it in my mailbox a few days ago! I think it'll be a quick read!\nThanks for ringing and sending it to me!\nOp de post naar de volgende lezer!\nHeb dit boek voordat ik op vakantie ging uitgelezen. Opzich leuk om te weten hoe de serie The Nanny er is gekomen en dat veel is gebaseerd op haar eigen ervaringen, maar dat idee van 'aan je hoofd zeuren' kreeg ik ook wel. Ik had het idee dat ik een verlengde versie van een verhaal over een ster in de Story of de Prive zat te lezen, eerlijk gezegd.\nHet boek is vandaag aangekomen.\nHet ziet er leuk uit, veel foto's.\nIk ga er gelijk in beginnen, was gisteren klaar met mijn vorige ringboek.\nDank je wel voor het opsturen en ringen!\ni received the book today.\nIt looks like a fun and nice book, i like the photo's in it.\nI am going to read it right now.\nThanks for sending it to me and thanks for this ring!\nInteressant boek om te lezen, het word ook wel makkelijk gemaakt met de foto's die erin zitten van haar leven.\nWat het gelijk ook weer leuker maakt om te lezen.\nIt is an intersting book to read.\nAlso to see the photo's that are inside the book.\nErg leuk om te lezen!! Leuke foto's, leuke manier van schrijven!!\nAnd Fran found her way back home again! Thanks for sending it, Bontekever! (btw: did you read the book? I haven't seen a journal entry of it....).",

    "text": "Thanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Lesbia makes her career dream a reality!\nWhen Lesbia was very young, her parents made a difficult decision. They wanted a better future for their family, so they moved from Central America to the U.S. to find it.\nDuring that period, her parents were back and forth between the countries, and Lesbia rarely saw them. Six years later, she finally joined them on American soil.\nWhen she started school, Lesbia couldn\u2019t speak English. Other kids made fun of her name. She struggled.\nBut eventually, she learned to stop caring what other people thought. She realized that this new country held a wealth of opportunities.\nAs time went on and they worked to adjust to the U.S., other members of Lesbia\u2019s family found Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF). They referred her, and after obtaining a work permit, she was able to get temporary child care assistance at HUF.\nHUF changed Lesbia\u2019s life. She was supported by multiple HUF programs, including Income Support, Financial Literacy, and the Bridge Program, where she completed the Customer Service and Sales Training, as well as the Patient Care Technician EKG/Phlebotomy Training. She\u2019s currently finishing a class in math at Sheridan Technical School, and has a bright future.\nThanks to HUF, Lesbia\u2019s family will no longer live paycheck to paycheck, and she, her husband, and her children will live better lives.\nThe Bridge Program at Hispanic Unity opens up a world of opportunities! With the generous support of @Citi Foundation and the Community #ProgressMakers grant, program participants have access to tuition assistance for career pathways in high demand fields, including national certifications in Patient Care Technician (PCT) and Customer Service and Sales Training (CSST).\nThanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Marisol makes her dream a reality!\nFrom Boston, to Puerto Rico, to Miami, Marisol has been following her American dream since birth.\nBorn in Boston, she spent several years in the historic city before her family relocated to Puerto Rico, where she grew up and attended school.\nAs an adult, Marisol made the difficult decision to move to Florida in search of a better future for her family. She sought more safety and security. Marisol was excited and deeply committed to grow and thrive in her new home!\nStarting fresh presented numerous challenges, however. She struggled to find work while caring for her two beloved children.\nLuckily, Marisol found Hispanic Unity of Florida. Her brother had participated in HUF\u2019s Center for Working Families program and referred her.\nMarisol took the many opportunities offered by HUF and ran with them. She received income support through gift cards, child care assistance, hurricane relief help, and affordable housing. She also entered the Bridge Program where she became certified through HUF\u2019s Customer Service and Sales Representative (CSR) training.\nShortly thereafter, she was able to secure part-time employment. Marisol says that the training helped her be more in touch with clients and better understand their needs.\nThe hard-working mother wanted to take things further and thrive in a new career, so she completed HUF\u2019s Patient Care Technician Program (PCT) at Sheridan Technical College \u2013 a highly specialized training with a focus on EKG and Phlebotomy.\nCountless new opportunities are now available to Marisol, and she plans to move on into the Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) Program. Eventually, she\u2019ll work in a private practice, and she credits HUF for helping her to empower herself and help ensure her family\u2019s successful future.\nThe Urban Institute recently released a research report titled Upskilling the Immigrant Workforce to Meet Employer Demand for Skilled Workers.\nThe report takes a look at the whole US but supplements its findings through site visits and interviews with a variety of stakeholders in three metro areas, Seattle, Dallas and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.\nHispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) participated in the study and shared with the researchers our own insights into the work we do assisting immigrants who are both unemployed as well as, underemployed.\nHow many of us know that Broward County\u2019s percentage of foreign-born residents is nearly 33% \u2013 or 3 out every 10 residents?\nThe implications are significant for our community. Our immigrant population is mostly first generation. And the needs of this population are different then communities where the immigrants are second or third generation or where the immigrants are English literate and highly educated.\nLocal communities with large foreign born residents must invest in foundational resources to assist these immigrants in their integration \u2013 which in turn \u2013 benefits the whole community.\nAt HUF where we serve immigrants from 30 different nations, our work is focused on English language instruction, education (for both parents and children), economic development (employment, small business creation, asset building, health and child care supports) and civic engagement.\nThis from the research report: This diversity within the immigrant workforce\u2014with high numbers at both ends of the educational spectrum\u2014is important context for our focus in this report on opportunities for immigrants employed in lower- and middle-skilled jobs.\nAt HUF, we simultaneously work with former professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc. as well as individuals who never completed high school. This diversity within the immigrant community requires different approaches to the work community organizations such as HUF undertakes. For us, it means providing core services that are fundamental to all clients while providing \u201cadd-ons\u201d such as information on how to have educational credentials certified for immigrants with college or advanced degrees.\n\u201cOne out of every six workers in the US are immigrants.\u201d The research report\u2019s conclusions offers guidance for all our community\u2019s stakeholders: state and local policy makers, workforce development service providers, funders and employers. Woven throughout the report are the community based organizations that are often at the frontlines of the work with immigrants.\nSouth Florida is at full employment. Now is the time to support and address the needs of our whole community including communities of color and the immigrant community.\nThis article was originally published on June 6, 2018 on the UnidosUS website.\nAs of this posting, Florida is the only state in the nation to not have a federally approved accountability plan.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) submitted its revised Florida Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Plan to the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE).\nHispanic Unity of Florida is a member of a coalition of civil rights organizations that earlier this year during Florida\u2019s Legislative Session, proposed legislation that would align Florida\u2019s school accountability system with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the largest federal law governing K-12 education. Florida\u2019s current system neglects to factor into its school grades the test scores of many English learner (EL) and Latino students, and fails to use a native language assessment when appropriate for the 10% of Florida\u2019s K-12 students who are learning English.\nEffective implementation of ESSA at the state and district level is key to ensuring that educators and ELs have the data and tools they need to become English proficient and academically successful as swiftly as possible.\nUnder ESSA, in exchange for federal funds, states must track and report the performance of subgroups of students\u2014racial and ethnic minorities, those from low-income families, ELs, and those with disabilities\u2014when assessing school performance.\nFlorida\u2019s revised ESSA plan, however, sidesteps the intent of the federal law by bundling together the lowest-performing students regardless of subgroup. That means schools that are not meeting the needs of every subgroup can still get a passing grade, and parents are not aware.\nThe revised Florida plan creates the new \u201cFederal Percent of Points Earned Index\u201d (FPPEI) of which subgroup performance and an English Language Proficiency Indicator will be components. The fact that Florida created the FPPEI is a good sign that the state recognizes its obligation to align the state\u2019s system with federal law. The FPPEI, a new section of a Florida school\u2019s report card, in effect creates a parallel accountability system. The calculation of a school\u2019s grade still does not take into account subgroup performance and English language proficiency. This decision is problematic, confusing and unnecessary.\nWhat\u2019s more, while the federal government urges states, when appropriate, to test students in their native language to better assess what they know\u2014Florida chose not to meet this requirement, despite being home to one of the nation\u2019s largest EL population.\nA recent report by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) study highlights that Florida educates the third-largest K\u201312 EL population in the nation. ELs make up 10% of Florida\u2019s student population; nearly 290,000 students. The majority of ELs\u201475%\u2014in the state speak Spanish. According to recent Florida state assessment results, double-digit gaps exist in graduation rates and academic achievement between ELs and their non\u2013EL peers.\nAs a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, it is estimated that Florida is now home to between 10,000 to 12,000 Puerto Rican students. While these students are American citizens, they also are predominately ELs.\nFor more information about ESSA and education issues impacting the Latino community, visit unidosus.org and UnidosUS\u2019s education-focused website, Progress Report: Ensuring the Success of All Students.\nHave conversations about ESSA with parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, candidates and state elected officials. Bring up the \u201cAdvocate Questions\u201d in the conversation.\nEngage parents and other stakeholders in your area by hosting an ESSA meeting at your school or a community-based organization.\nFollow and Vote: Follow what local and statewide candidates have to say about education. Vote for candidates in the Primary Election on August 28, 2018, and the General Election, November 6, 2018 who are committed to all K-12 students. As voters we can and must make education a top campaign issue this election cycle!\nLearn more: LULAC Florida will host an Organizational Roundtable and Community Forum on June 15, 2018 in Miami, at the Dadeland Marriott at 5:30 p.m.\nTo learn more about why activists are urging Secretary DeVos to reject Florida\u2019s ESSA Plan, read this Education Week article.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program offers free weekly citizenship classes, assistance with the naturalization interview and application, and financial coaching. Classes are open at eight library locations: Little Havana, North Miami Beach, Homestead, Kendall, Miami, Aventura, Sunny Isles and Hialeah. For general information or registration, please visit: http://www.HUFcitizen.org or contact: (305) 562-1796.\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows that more than 88,000 people obtained legal permanent resident (LPR) status in South Florida in 2016. That makes our region, the third highest ranking in the country for people obtaining LPR status, following New York City and Los Angeles.\nIn the last decade, HUF has empowered more than 12,000 aspiring citizens from more than 30 countries to achieve their goal of U.S. citizenship. In 2017, more than 5,000 eligible students attended classes at HUF and at partnering Broward and Miami-Dade libraries, and more than 30 trained volunteers contributed more than 2,300 hours as instructors last year.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program led by the Office of New Americans (ONA) of Miami-Dade County and Hispanic Unity of Florida, Inc. is a county-wide initiative made possible with the support from our Corporate Founding Partner Citi Community Development and the generosity of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation. Partners in Miami-Dade County include: Miami-Dade Public Library System and the City of North Miami Beach and their North Miami Beach Library. Media partners include Univision 23, UniMas 69, Amor 107.5, Mix 98.3, WQBA and Radio Mambi.\nThe Citi Foundation today announced that Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) was selected as the recipient of a $500,000 grant as part of the 2018 Community Progress Makers Fund.\nThe Fund is a $20 million, two-year initiative by the Citi Foundation to support high-impact community organizations that are driving economic opportunities in our communities, by bringing together residents, nonprofits, businesses, and municipal agencies.\nHUF joins a group of 40 change agents (five in south Florida) that are playing a key role in coordinating the efforts of multiple partners toward common goals and working in new ways to address urban challenges in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami/South Florida, New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington D.C.\nThrough the fund, HUF will have the opportunity to offer low- and moderate-income families with access to customized vocational training programs, credentials and career pathways for middle-skill jobs in high demand.\nby commenting on this blog and on our Facebook post.\nWe are pleased to announce our new Board officers, as well as the full slate of Board members for 2018.\nCharles Tatelbaum, a Director with the Ft.

    "text": "Northwest Alaska Back Country Outfitters offers discerning Fly fisherman the opportunity to tackle the worlds best fishing for Dolly Varden!\nNorthwest of Kotzebue, Alaska, are numerous drainages entering the Chukchi Sea. These great watersheds hold Dolly Varden in the 15-20 pounds range and include the Wulik, Kivalina, and the Kelly River. The current world's record is 27.7 pounds on the Wulik River.\nThese rivers can only be reached via bush planes and using rafts and inflatable canoes. We can arrange your flights and all of your gear. Most of these world class fish have never seen a fly and you will have the entire drainage to yourself!\nCall for prices and gear information. In Northwest Alaska the best time to target Dolly Varden in during the spawn which runs from the first week of August through week 3. Most of our clients land between 75-100 fish in the 15+ pound range and most groups will land a few fish over 20 pounds!\nAll gear rentals are based on 7 day minimum trips.\nRead about our service in Fly fisherman Magazine.\n\"Two rod-and-reel outfits suit the trip. Use a 5-weight for the eager grayling that are often rising, and an 8- or 10-weight outfit for char, salmon, and sheefish. Use a floating line on the 5-weight, and a multi-tip line for the heavier rod (RIO Coldwater VersiTip or Scientific Anglers Tri Tip).\nBring #2-6 streamers such as Barr\u2019s Meat Whistles (black, white, tan), #1/0 to #4 Clouser Minnows (chartreuse over white), and Egg-Sucking Bunny Leeches. Realistic egg imitations (cheese-colored, 6 to 8mm), mouse patterns, poppers, and large rubber-legged stoneflies are also valuable.\"\nSOAR 16 foot Canoes...Perfect for Dolly trips into the Brooks Range!\n2018 Fall Dolly Spawn. Lots of really nice Dollies landed with the largest of the season being 38 inches! That is a big Dolly!",

    "text": "Hair updo styles. Pictures of updo hairstyles.\nAre you looking at a more sophisticated hair updo style for your wedding or prom? If so, we have a great collection of examples that will help you find the right look. Our examples focus on women who have somewhat longer hair that can be used in dramatic fashion. Here you will find a number of updo hairstyles from those close to casual to others that push the boundaries and make an unforgettable impression. The first row of examples is highlighted by the third photo which features a complicated pinned up style, yet has enough play to make it attractive. The second photo is a great example of how bangs can be used to really highlight the face while still having the rest of the hair updo pinned back. Naturally, augmenting your hair with natural decorations such as flowers can make for a great way to set your style apart. In the second row we see more classic examples of sophisticated wedding and prom updo styles. While the first example is perfect for those with very curly hair, the third and fourth are pure classic updo\u2019s perfect for more formal occasions. If you have long, thick hair, then you might want to try the example in the second photo to highlight your face. The third row is a great combination of pulled back styles along with loose, more casual feel. The second example does require some work and spray, but the results are perfect for weddings. For younger women, especially those attending the prom the first and fourth photos provide excellent examples of what can be done. For the final row we have another combination of both casual and pinned up hair that you can choose from when attending the wedding or prom. In particular, the third photo shows a dramatic style indeed.\nPortfolio 3 showcases delicate up-dos mainly for long straight hair. Picture number 1 and 2 are beautiful examples of straightforward updo\u2019s incorporating hair accessories that are fit for the most magnificent wedding. Picture number 10 is a gorgeous and sophisticated low chignon with the hair neatly pinned back away from the face.",

Iyan ang vision ni Mayor Marcy na i-institutionalize ang lahat ng city events. So naging tagni-tagni siya in tune with the overall direction, which is to give emphasis and importance to family, culture, heritage, shoes, and food,\u201d Winnie Mariano, city events manager, said in an interview.\nAmong the highlights of the Sapatos Festival will be the shoe bazaar that will run from November 12 to January 6 at the Freedom Park, right across the Marikina City Hall.\nOver 50 manufacturers from Marikina will be selling their products \u2013 shoes, bags, belts, wallets, and other accessories at attractive prices.\nMarikina is best known as the Shoe Capital of the Philippines because it was here where the first pair of shoes was made in 1887, paving the way for the inception of a vibrant shoe industry known for its high quality craftsmanship, durability, and comfort.\nRehiyon, Rehiyon Festival, on the other hand, will honor those who came from other places in the country and settled in the city, becoming Marike\u00f1os in the process as they successfully assimilated with the locals and absorbed their tradition, culture, heritage, values and ways of life.\nLastly, the Christmas Festival, which started with the installation of Christmas lights and lanterns on the riverbank, streets, parks and other places in Marikina, will feature a concert comprised of local artists and bands and ending with a fireworks display will be held on December 30 at the Marikina Sports Center.",

So I started googling to see if there was any challenges already out there that did what I was looking for. A few that I found wasn't really what I was looking for. I wanted to also create all the rabbit hole lots along with the residential lots with out having to move into each house and leave other sims behind. I didn't want to have to repopulate the whole town with just my sim either so I decided to create my own. So here is what I have come up with so far.\nI was requested to write down the rules for this challenge so here are the challenge rules!\nYour sim has come from an over crowded town with lots of noise and pollution. They have traveled far away from any civilization and has settled here to start over from scratch. This area has no buildings, no houses and no residents. This is a great place for your sim to start over in life and build everything from scratch from the ground up.\nPick any world you like and go into Edit Town and delete every house and building. This includes any rabbit holes.\nPick your sim either by creating new or a preexisting one.\nYour lifespan can be what ever you want, I suggest a long one. I'm using a fairy so I have a very long life span.\nYour sim will not have a job to start out with so you will need to make money in other ways like fishing, searching for flowers or gems to sell.\nOnce your sim has some money you can do other things to make money as well like painting, photography, writing for example.\nOnce some job buildings are placed you can have your sim have a job along with previous mentions of money making activities.\nYour sim can buy properties or become business owners to make money as well.\n~When you build the house to rent, you don't need to build with your own money otherwise your sim will end up spending double the cost. Build the house then go in and have your sim rent it out.\n~Once a residential lot has been created for a certain category, you can add to it later as long as it doesn't take it out of it's original category; for example: a starter home changing to a family home.\nThere can be NO residents living in the town until there is a house sufficient enough for them to live.\nFor example: must have fridge, toilet, bed and shower/tub along with all flooring and wallpapers in the home as well.\nOnce there is a place for a sim to move in, you can move any sim in you want or an immigrant can move in. No Immigrants are aloud to move into any empty lots so make sure they are all set to no visitors until a residential lot is built.\nAll community and residential lots must be built by your sim.\nAll Parks must be built by your sim.\nAll active job's that need a building need to be built by your sim.\nYour sim can have any personal life you choose. Once there are residents living in your town, your sim can date, get married, have children or your sim can live alone for their entire life. However you choose.\nAny community lot can be combined with another community lot. For example, a tattoo parlor can be built with a salon. More than two can be built together which comes in handy when your not working with very many lots in the world or it's a small island. If you do not have an expansion pack that has one of the requirement builds listed above that is okay.\nYou can only fail the challenge if one thing were to happen, your sim dies before the above requirements are met.\nThere is a possibility of any of these rules changing as I go along in my video series as I have not tested out this challenge. Any ideas or suggestions or if I missed anything in the rules are welcome!\nLet me know how this challenge is going for you!\nI started a game similar to this and had to place a few community lots and my town's main library has a city hall rabbit hole rug for editing the chances of alien abductions resulting in pregnancies.I placed skill requiremnents for aditional building and they also have to build their house first before any other buildings get built in edit town.I also did require lots for new families to have a mailbox,trash bin. wall section,burglar alarm,fire alarm,sleeping bags and laptop computers though cheap ones.The founders have to get a house built before winter arrives and survive their first winter before adding to their house and they also have to start growing plants on their lot before the second winter and new families could begin arriving the following year in late spring or early summer.I allow chess tables and martial arts equipment to start showing up after a second household is in town.Building is based on donations on community lots or taxes collected from incomes.\nI made a change in the rules when it comes to building the house you want to rent out to your town.",

The online version at http://www.herongyang.com/Service/ GetExchangeRate_WSDL_11_SOAP_11_RPC.wsdl gives me an access problem because the site does not like Perl HTTP client agent.\nI used readable('true') to make the SOAP request XML message is nice format.\nSOAP::Lite does allow you to make an RPC call through a WSDL document like a local method call: GetExchangeRate('USD', 'JPY', '2007-07-07').\nSOAP::Lite is smart to convert the RPC call into a SOAP request message.\nSOAP::Lite is smart to provide type information xsi:type=\"...\" to support message encoding.\nSOAP::Lite is smart to pick up the return value from the SOAP response message.\nSOAP::Lite is not smart to follow the parts=\"fromCurrencyPart toCurrencyPart datePart\" specified in the WSDL document to order the parameters. It follows the original order of how these message parts were defined in the WSDL document. To correct the issue, you need to make the call like this: GetExchangeRate('2007-07-07', 'USD', 'JPY').\nConclusion, SOAP::Lite 0.710 does not support the parts=\"...\" of the \"soap:body\" WSDL statement.",

At North it shares borders with Thessaly, at West with Western Greece and at South with Attica. It is surrounded by the Aegean Sea and the Gulf of Evia at the east and by the Corinthian Gulf at the South.\nThe Region has a population of 546.870 inhabitants, corresponding to 5.07% of the total population of the country. The 33% of the population in Sterea Ellada is urban, concentrated mainly in the departments of Euvoia (210.210 inhabitants) and Fthiotitda (158.220 inhabitants), the 15% is semi-urban and the 52% is rural.\nSterea Ellada occupies a total area of 15,549 sq. km., corresponding to 11,8% of the total area of Greece and consists of 735,8 million hectares of mountain area, 497,1 million hectares of semi-mountainous area and 322,2 million hectares of lowland area. The two main islands of the Region, Evia and Skyros, are pole of tourist attraction.\nSterea Ellada is the industrial centre of Greece, nevertheless it has rural areas too. It is worth noting that only 3% of the total area is residential. The main mountainous area of Sterea Ellada is formed around its centre. Forests cover the 25% of the total regional area, while 2% is covered by water. The cultivated areas of the region occupy the 26% of total area, while the 43% is used in farming activities. The Region is rich in special and rare ecosystems; 18 special environmental sites of the Region are being protected according to the NATURA 2000 framework, while there are 3 Special Protection Areas. Sterea Ellada is famous for its world-renown hot springs and spa.\n\u03a4he share of the population that is economically active is 33%, from of which 9,4 % works in the primary sector, 51,5% in the secondary sector and 42,1 % in the tertiary sector. The unemployment rate accounts for the 16,1% of the population and lies slightly above the national average. Immigration flows have importantly affected the demography of the region, as the immigrants\u2019 share in the composition of the regional population accounts for 8%, one of the highest in Greece.\nDue to favorable conditions and because of its proximity to Attiki, the Region of Sterea Ellada has emerged as one of the industrial centres of Greece with important industrial and manufacturing activities, accounting for the 46% of the regional GDP. Moreover, activites related to the tertiary sector account for the 43% of the regional GDP and gravitate mostly real estate and public services. The tourism sector, on the other hand, counts up only for the 4,4% of the regional GDP and is less developed than the national average, however, it has great potential for further growth due to the region\u2019s natural hot springs and spa (Kamena Vourla, Edipsos), archaeological sites and geographic location.\nThe agricultural sector counts up only for the 8% percent of the regional GDP% and is estimated to be subject of further decline in the future. Rural activities concentrate in the production of olive oil, wheat, fruits and vegetables, as well as in the breeding of livestock. Numerous agricultural products of the Region have been enlisted in the Protected Designation Origin EU scheme, such as, the Olives of Stylida, Konservolia of Amfissa and Atalanti, Katiki Domokou (goat cheese), Formaela (goat cheese),Fistiki of Ftiotida and Dry Figs of Kimi.

If you have OSD and or IO Board connected and no telemetry modem, you can leave small jumper on. If you have OSD and or IO Board and telemetry modem connected, take out jumper to have normal operation on telemetry modems.\n1 x Assembled jD-Telemetry board.\n1 x 10cm extension cable.",

That food was ready fast!\nI have two beefs with Chipotle.\n#1: I would LOVE a brown rice option. I know this would bring a little bit of a nuttiness into the flavor profile, but I would love it as an option.\n#2: What the heck!!!! is going on with your chips?!?!?!\nI checked the nutrition facts before ordering and found a very disturbing fact.\nFIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY CALORIES! Woah Nelly.\nAnd don\u2019t be fooled by that bag! The chips started where the crease is, just above the word Chips.\nI did allow myself eight chips, and I am convinced that they are laced with crack. Or at least lard, which is sort of my crack. They were tasty but not tasty enough for nearly half of my daily calories allowance!!!\nGUESS how many calories are in 4 tablespoons of the Chipotle vinaigrette?!\nAward Winning Recipe: Gluten Free!\nHow many ways can you top a chicken?",

    "text": "With Exchange Server 2013, there are certain scenarios wherein we might face issues to access Outlook Web Apps and Exchange Admin Center. This might be due to lack of permission or invalid configuration of Exchange Server 2013.\nAnd for these kind of errors, there are certain remedies that can be followed to resolve.\nWe faced such issues after re-installing Exchange Sever 2013 on a server. After spending few hours, we've taken various steps from different sources to resolve the errors, And here in this article, the possible solutions are specified that can be applied to resolve it.\nService account that is being used for administrating Exchange Server, should be member of \"Organization Management\", \"Records Management\" and \"Recipient Management\" groups. To check this, run below command in Exchange Management Shell.\nIf, Exchange Admin user account is not in results, then, just add Exchange Admin account in above mentioned groups in Active Directory.\nOpen your ECP/OWA URL in browser to verify whether issue is resolved or not. If not, then, proceed further with below steps.\nCheck that OWA and ECP Application Pools are running on .NET Framework v4.0. It may be incomplete installation of framework that causes the error.\n%windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\aspnet_regiis.exe -i and then restart IIS.\nError should get resoled now, if not then follow solution -3 as below.\nLogin to your Exchange 2013 CAS server.\nStart the Exchange Management Shell.\nNavigate to Exchange 2013 binaries location, for example:\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Bin\".\nExecute the UpdateCas.ps1 PowerShell script to rebuild OWA interface.\nNow, execute UpdateConfigFiles.ps1 PowerShell script. [It is recommended to execute this PowerShell script after installing latest cumulative update of Microsoft Exchange 2013].\nOk, now, it's time to check whether the error is resolved or not. If you are still facing the error then follow the below steps.\nFor detailed information on canary data and for guidelines to delete canary data, kindly refer Microsoft Article.\nNow, if you are still struggling with the errors, then, you can proceed with next step, re-creating AD schema and system mailbox attributes.\nThis is a good Microsoft Article with detailed explanation and steps to re-create AD schema and system mailbox attribute.\nNext step is to proceed with creating new virtual directories, if you are still struggling with the errors.\nNow, it's time to create new virtual directories for ECP and for OWA. So, as first step, we will remove ECP virtual directories with below command in Exchange Management Shell.\nRemove-EcpVirtualDirectory -Identity \"BRExchange1\\ecp (Default Web Site)\"\nRemove-EcpVirtualDirectory -Identity \"BRExchange2\\ecp (exchange back end)\"\nNow, we will create new virtual directories with below command. Here we have to specify internal and external URL for ECP.\nNew-EcpVirtualDirectory -Server BRExchange1 -InternalUrl \"https://BRExchange1.mydomain.com/ecp\" -ExternalUrl \"https://ecp.mydomain.com\" -WebSiteName \"Default Web Site\"\nNew-EcpVirtualDirectory -Server BRExchange2 -InternalUrl \"https://BRExchange2.mydomain.com/ecp\" -ExternalUrl \"https://ecp.mydomain.com\" -WebSiteName \"Exchange Back End\"\nIn second step, we will remove OWA virtual directories as below. Below steps is only required if your facing above error while opening mailbox.\nRemove-OwaVirtualDirectory -Identity \"BRExchange1\\owa (Default Web Site)\"\nRemove-OwaVirtualDirectory -Identity \"BREXchange2\\owa (exchange back end)\"\nNow, we will create new virtual directories with below command. Here we have to specify internal and external URL for OWA.\nNew-OwaVirtualDirectory -Server BRExchange1 -InternalUrl \"https://BRExchange1.mydomain.com/owa\" -ExternalUrl \"https://mail.mydomain.com/owa\" -WebSiteName \"Default Web Site\"\nNew-OwaVirtualDirectory -Server BRExchange2 -InternalUrl \"https://BRExchange2.mydomain.com/owa\" -ExternalUrl \"https://mail.mydomain.com/owa\" -WebSiteName \"Default Web Site\"\nHope the possible solutions listed here help you out to resolve the Exchange 2013 - EAC/OWA errors.\nHow to Clear cache in SharePoint Designer?",

    "text": "Calisthenics based functional fitness studio, MultiFit offers strength based training with the correct form of gym workout. The startup venture has plans to spread presence in the Indian market.\nThe Indian fitness industry is going through a massive change. As the average Indian is travelling the world, they\u2019ve turned more conscious of newer ways and approaches to remain in shape and bringing new business ideas to the Indian market. In the past 5 years, the fitness levels of Indians has lifted massively and still the experts consider it as the tip of the iceberg, which means, the avenue of opportunities is tremendous.\nRealising the same, 4 times Everest base camp trekked, an advance level diver- Samir Kapoor has turned his passion for fitness into a new health revolution- MultiFit.\nBased on the firm belief that fitness should extend beyond dumbbells and machines, MultiFit is one of the few gyms in the country that focus on functional training. It challenges the conventional gym imagery by abandoning traditional equipment and narrow goals, instead using simple tools like ropes and tires improve one's performance at everyday activities. The brand was established by Samir Kapoor as a way to bring a fresh perspective to health.\nShare the business DNA of MultiFit. What is its USP?\n\u2018The Soul of our gym is in our trainers\u2019. We are a calisthenics based functional fitness studio and focus more on strength based training with the correct form. We believe in Continuous Varied Intensive Training. We understand one needs to balance in Bodybuilding. We focus not only on weights but also on a good cardiovascular endurance along with flexibility agility, power and strength. Most managers at MultiFit have been certified by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) giving them enough knowledge to shed light on the importance of functional fitness and the best way to practice fitness thus resulting into staying fit.\nWhat is the current scenario of fitness industry and among the top fitness brand, where do you position MultiFit and why?\nMultiFit as a brand focuses on movement rather than exercise. Our philosophy is a fine blend of traditional values and the modern, showcasing fitness in the most interesting way possible. We want to familiarise the audience with the new techniques of fitness which can be followed in daily movements of the body. We are India\u2019s first Calisthenics based gym \u2013 Calisthenics are body weight exercises consisting of gross motor movements that help in improving one\u2019s balance, agility, co-ordination and strength. We definitely are on the right path providing scientific knowledge to our patrons about every exercise which they do so understanding of the fitness art becomes easier.\nDefine the growing competition in Indian fitness industry as per your experience of a relatively new player and how did you strategize to overcome this growing competition.\nSometimes being small and nimble in an evolving or rather sunrise industry is a blessing in disguise. Being new we are not basking in past glory neither do we believe we know it all. We believe that fitness industry needs some new players to come in and take the game to the next level. We take training very seriously along with breaking the stereotype of a conventional gym and adding a fun element in every workout which is taken.\nWhat are your views on the Indian fitness industry? Is it still challenging to convince or motivate Indian consumers to hit the gym? If yes, how do you overcome challenges pertaining to consumer behaviour?\nIndia, as a country has developed in terms of thinking and adopting new values yet staying true to its tradition. Hence, when it comes to gyming, Indians don\u2019t mind ditching the old fashioned machines and giving a rest to monotonous workouts. An aware Indian knows that traditional gyms don\u2019t work, unless you make it interesting and challenging. This is what keeps the patrons engaged and motivated to take out time from their busy schedules and hit the gym. Another addition to motivating people is Athletics based training which is another type of training that gets people addicted to working out.\nWhat are the biggest opportunities existing in Indian Fitness Industry? How is it a beneficial area of investment for start-ups or aspiring entrepreneurs?\nWith very few organized players in the space it\u2019s a big opportunity for startups who have the right vision and the right team. This industry is growing at a neck break speed and is slated to grow 25 fold in the next 5 years. According to a joint study by FICCI and PWC, the Indian wellness industry will touch Rs 1 trillion in 2016. With EBITDA numbers north of 50 per cent it\u2019s the right space for players with passion and dedication to make a change.\nDo you franchise? If No, why? Also, if you do, please share the terms and eligibility to select a franchisee.\nWe have a very unique franchise model. The franchise is only the finance partner. The Gym is run by MultiFit this includes hiring, training and Sales. Also one of the key criteria we look at is the entrepreneurs interest in training. Every single employee has to work with us for at least a month before he is shifted to a franchise. So we ensure that the DNA of the gym stays the same.\nSuggest tips for the entrepreneurs who are taking or willing to take franchise of MultiFit.\nOne needs to remember \u201cThe Soul of Our Gym is in our trainers\u201d. People are your assets and you need to work with them to make them successful. If people out there are passionate enough in contributing to the fitness industry, next stop \u2013 MultiFit. We believe we will be changing the face of fitness.\nIs it a boot strapped venture or you raised funds from the market?\nThis is a 100 per cent self-funded venture.\nWhat\u2019s the current geographical presence of MultiFit? Why not entered in northern region as yet? Or if you did, why not expanding aggressively?\nWe want to reach out to places where there is a dearth of fitness. We want to provide fitness where it is absolutely needed.\nAt the moment, we already have 2 Centres in North India Jaipur and Gurgaon and we are planning more in the near future.\nWhat are your expansion plans? Any new outlet to open in near future? Which potential area in Indian market is still untouched and why?\nWe plan to have 30 branches by Dec 2017. Karadi (Pune) and Gurgaon are two clubs going live in the next fortnight. The new markets in India being Bangalore, Indore, Mumbai and two tier II cities.\nIndia as a country is a completely untapped market. 99 per cent of the country is Untapped. Currently 60per cent of India\u2019s population is under 30 years of age and it\u2019s growing steadily at 8per cent p.a. Out of 80 million middle class households, 55 million (69 per cent) reside in tier II and tier III cities which accounts for 70per cent of total consumption in India. This is the Real India with new dreams, aspirations, wants, and needs. The future of health and fitness is immense and will be driven by this emerging new India.\nDo you feel rapidly growing fitness aggregators of FitTech are big threats to entrepreneurs like you who are most dominating the market through physical presence?\nNot at all, I think they are only creating more awareness of the Industry and will only be helping players like ours. Physical gyms will always stay, we are talking physical activity, it\u2019s like saying one can learn swimming online. Not happening. People may workout on their own, but man is a social animal, working out with people keeps one motivated and it\u2019s the sheer energy which becomes an addiction. We have live cricket on various channels, but year on year the number of people going to the stadium has only increased because of the electrifying environment, fitness is no different.\nInternational Fitness Trends Of 2018..\nWhy It\u2019s Important to Train Staff..\nKey to Winning Consumer Confidence..\nMajor Challenges Of Online Education..\nBest Business Opportunities in Hyderabad..\nFranchising: A Perfect Post Sabbatical Option..\nWhy F&B is a Recession Free Industry..\nChanging the Food Refrigeration Biz in India..\nSalons Moving Ahead with Consumer Trends..\nThis Start-up Has Changed the Fresh Juice Biz..\nKey Highlights of the Interim Budget 2019..\nTransforming Sportswear Into 'Sports Fashion'..",

He was very easy to work with and always made me feel at ease. He worked with me financially so I never felt pressured. The process in its entirety was simple and fairly stress free. His office staff was kind and helpful as well. \u201d -Tami M.\n\u201cThis firm and all of their staff, especially Tracy Taylor, were extremely knowledgeable about even the most technical aspects of the law and all issues that came up during the process.

    "text": "\u201cSo, did the cleaning lady come?\u201d I asked him.\nA cleaning lady refused to clean my house! (So, it is true. You really do have to clean your house before the cleaning lady arrives.) I would have happily paid her $100 for four hours worth of work, but she rejected me and my money. Furthermore, she cost herself a customer because I will never again call her and offer her work.\nI am mortified and mystified that my kitchen and bathroom were deemed too big of a job for one person to handle in four hours.\nThat\u2019s nutty! I could clean my whole house in four hours if I really put my mind to it\u2013BY MYSELF! Sheesh\u2026sounds like you found a cleaning lady that\u2019s SPOILED!\nI wonder what her house looks like \u2013 my aunt was a cleaning lady, and although her clients\u2019 homes were spotless, hers has always been in a bit of chaos.\nMost of the cleaning people around here require this same \u201cfirst time\u201d fee. Our house was, quite literally, brand new when we hired a cleaning lady. It had been built just two weeks before we moved in. Still, nearly everyone we interviewed also wanted a first clean fee\u2026.If you have the time to look around, you can probably find someone who won\u2019t charge it. We eventually did, though ours really, geuinely didn\u2019t require it.\nyou are too funny! and while i realize that children totally send our lives into disarray, i also know you\u2026neat as a pin.\ni am so sure she couldn\u2019t clean your kitchen and bathroom! ridiculous lady!\nI just hired a cleaning lady and your story was my worst fear. So, before she came by to give us an estimate, I felt like I had to CLEAN my house for the cleaning lady. How warped is that?\nOurs did charge us about $30 more for the first visit, where they do a deep clean. I can understand that though as things like my windows and blinds have rarely been cleaned and I won\u2019t even go into my lighting fixtures. When you don\u2019t have a maid there are just things you don\u2019t find time to do (at least I don\u2019t).\nIt sounds like this maid might have been a little high-maintenance though. Maybe you can find another who isn\u2019t so picky. When I walked around with my new one and told her I\u2019d make sure the kids toys were picked up, she kind of chuckled like she was thinking that\u2019s not necessary\u2026so who knows what they expect really!\nI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. And no way would I ever consider seeing how much it would be to clean MY house! Yikes!\nwow\u2026 that is super lame!\nRemind me never to hire a cleaning lady!\nI clean houses for a living. I do not charge extra the first time I go. It is easier and I get it done faster if people just pick up any clutter that may be around. Since I don\u2019t live there, i would not know where it goes to put it away. That is the only thing I like people to do before I clean, otherwise they are doing my job, and what is the point? I usually clean 2 bathrooms, kitchen, family room, dining room, bedrooms in three or four hours. Three hours, I charge 50.00, 4 hours is 70.00. I do extra stuff all the time, like windows, blinds, I have cleaned basements, moved furniture, power washed outside patios, you name it. LOL I have loyal customers, and I am good to them back.\nPeople are LAZY. They want something for nothing. I used to clean houses for a living. I enjoyed it most of the time. $100 for cleaning a kitchen, dining room and what did you say, a bathroom? I can\u2019t remember. I could have cleaned your whole home for $100 and four hours, give or take a few minutes. People really are lazy I tell you.\nAnd whoever said that her aunt cleaned houses and hers was a wreck \u2013 I knew a girl like that. She was a sloppy cleaner too. I on the other hand had a neat and tidy home until I had baby number 3. And it goes downhill from there on many a day now.\nOMG! I could get my daughter to clean it for less.\nI hate cleaning ladies. There is no end to the trouble they have caused me. Go Mel! Good job for cleaning your own stuff.\negads! One would have thought she could have at least TRIED!\nI\u2019m hoping Karen (above) lives in Oklahoma City. I could use her!\nI want someone to pick up the clutter.\nThat doesn\u2019t take much time at all.\nOh, why do I love clutter so much?\nThat seems like a mighty high hourly rate for a cleaning lady. Mine charges $13/hour. Two of them come and clean my large house with 4 bathrooms in 2 1/2 hours. $65 for clean house. Best investment ever made.\nI\u2019m with Judy\u2026I love clutter too much, too, tho it drives me crazy. I once was a cleaning lady, when my kids were little and in school. I cleaned the houses of several people in my church whenever I was needed\u2026part-time and not every week, but the extra $50 came in handy when it was time to buy shoes for the kids or whatever. Boy, even without \u2018snooping\u2019, it\u2019s amazing what you learn about other people\u2019s lives. But one thing I was was discreet and I never talked about anything I saw or learned in anyone\u2019s home. People trusted me, and word-of-mouth kept me busy. I cleaned houses without a speck of dust in them\u2026I cleaned absolute MESSES! All in a day\u2019s work. Back then, we ladies charged $10 per hour\u2026I can\u2019t imagine what the going rate is now.\nA cleaning lady who wouldn\u2019t clean? she\u2019s in the wrong business! I have a great cleaning lady, she comes every 3 weeks. She\u2019s reasonable, she\u2019s good and trustworthy. The good ones ARE out there.\nI\u2019m Lisa, btw, I found my way over from Kellans.\nKeep looking- not all cleaning ladies are this way. My mom cleans houses and has a very loyal customer base, they actually do what they can just to keep her. She is purely word of mouth and has more people calling than she can keep up with. She will do a first time walk through and discuss what they want done, what she can get done in that time and a set amount and what day works. She requires them to declutter and be out of the house when she comes- people get in the way and slow her down. Most people like this because it helps keep them organized and not fall behind week to week. She is efficient, picky and knows her stuff. She will tell people what kind of cleaning supplies work best, they purchase that kind. She has even been asked to pick out someones new vacuum- she likes that because she\u2019s used so many different ones that she knows which work best and which have no suction\u2026..anyways, hope your search goes better.\nKaren, would you consider relocating to Nebraska? lol My house is a disaster. Between having a chronic illness and a full time job \u2013 my house is a disaster. I feel like I can\u2019t afford a cleaning lady. Besides the clutter in place would choke a horse!\nLOL I have helped pick out one of my customers new vacuums as well. Somebody mentoned nobody would to clean their house because it was an older farm house, yesterday I cleaned a farm house that is close to 100 years old. They have three dogs running around. LOL They are good people and I love cleaning for them. Good cleaning help is hard to find, but we are out there! I have become friends with all of the people I clean for. Also Mel, I cannot imagine walking into somebody\u2019s house and not even attempting to clean it. That is rude, and very unprofessional. She could have at least tried to do as much as she could in that time period. Sorry you had such a bad experience.\nabout Atonement \u2013 haven\u2019t seen the movie, but the book was great!",

    "text": "An example method involves providing, with a network management module of a network management system, current reroute statistics in a data structure based on the rerouting of the data from a logical circuit that has failed to a logical failover circuit in the network. The current reroute statistics include a committed information rate corresponding to the logical circuit in the network. The logical circuit is identified by a first logical circuit identifier. The logical failover circuit is identified by a second logical circuit identifier. The first and second logical circuit identifiers are renamed until the logical circuit has been restored from failure. Updated reroute statistics are provided, with the network management module, based on a change in a status of the logical circuit resulting from the committed information rate having been exceeded.\nThis patent arises from a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 7,460,468, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\nThis patent is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/348,077, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Obtaining Logical Performance Data for a Circuit in a Data Network,\u201d filed Jan. 21, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/348,592, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Provisioning and Maintaining a Circuit in a Data Network,\u201d filed Jan. 21, 2003. This patent is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,117, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Providing A Failover Circuit For Rerouting Logical Circuit Data In A Data Network,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,047, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Renaming Logical Circuit Identifiers For Rerouted Logical Circuits In A Data Network,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,170, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Identifying A Logical Circuit Failure In A Data Network,\u201d filed on Dec. 23, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/744,921, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Rerouting Logical Circuit Data In A Data Network,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2003. All of the above-referenced applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\nPeriodically, failures may occur to the trunk circuits or the NNIs of network circuits in large-scale networks causing lost data. Currently, such network circuit failures are handled by dispatching technicians on each end of the network circuit (i.e., in each LATA) in response to a reported failure. The technicians manually access a logical element module to troubleshoot the logical circuit portion of the network circuit. The logical element module communicates with the switches in the data network and provides the technician with the status of the logical connections which make up the logical circuit. Once the technician determines the status of a logical connection at one end of a logical circuit (e.g., the host end), the technician then must access a network database to determine the location of the other end of the logical circuit so that its status may also be ascertained. If the technician determines the logical circuit is operating properly, the technician then accesses a physical element module to troubleshoot the physical circuit portion of the network circuit to determine the cause of the failure and then repair it. If, while troubleshooting a network circuit, the technician determines that a network circuit will be \u201cdown\u201d (i.e., losing data) for an extended time period, the technician may manually reroute the data from a failed network circuit to an available unused or \u201cbackup\u201d network circuit while the failed network circuit is being repaired.\nAs discussed briefly above, the network management module 176 may be configured to automatically reroute logical circuit data from a failed logical circuit to a logical failover circuit in the data network 2. During the reroute of logical circuit data, the network management module 176 may also be configured to rename the logical circuit identifier assigned to a failed logical circuit to the logical circuit identifier assigned to a corresponding logical failover circuit until the failed logical circuit has been restored. An illustrative method detailing the renaming of logical circuit identifiers is presented in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/745,047, entitled \u201cMethod And System For Automatically Renaming Logical Circuit Identifiers For Rerouted Logical Circuits In A Data Network,\u201d filed on Dec. 23, 2003, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\nThe logical operations 500 continue from operation 505 to operation 510 where the network management module 176 generates a table for presenting the current reroute statistics generated at operation 505. It will be appreciated that the table may be presented in an electronic format so that it is graphically displayed on one or more display terminals of the network management module 176. FIG. 6A is a table presenting current reroute statistics which may be generated for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. The table will be discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 6A below.\nAt operation 525, the network management module 176 generates updated reroute statistics based on the received updated trap data and then updates the table (generated at operation 510) at operation 530. FIG. 6B is a table presenting updated reroute statistics which may be generated for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. The table will be discussed in greater detail in the description of FIG. 6B below. The logical operations 500 then continue at operation 535.\nFIG. 6A is a table 190 presenting current reroute statistics which may be generated by the network management module 176 for rerouted logical circuits in the data network 2, according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG. 6A, the table includes a LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52, a REROUTE STATUS column 54, a LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56, a # HOPS column 58, a UTILIZATION column 60, a QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) column 62, and a REROUTE PERIOD column 64. The LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 lists the logical circuit IDs for logical circuits belonging to one or more network circuit customers in the data network 2. The REROUTE STATUS column 54 lists whether or not each of the logical circuits in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 is currently being rerouted. The LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56 lists the logical circuit IDs for logical failover circuits which may be utilized for rerouting data from the logical circuits listed in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52. The # HOPS column 58 lists the number of hops taken by data being communicated through the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56. The UTILIZATION column 60 lists the utilization percentage of the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56 by rerouted logical circuit data. The QoS column 62 lists the quality of service offered for rerouted data by each of the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56. The REROUTE PERIOD column 64 lists the amount of time the data from each of the logical circuits identified in the LOGICAL CIRCUIT ID column 52 has been rerouted to the logical failover circuits identified in the LOGICAL FAILOVER CIRCUIT ID column 56.\nproviding, with the network management module, updated reroute statistics based on a change in a status of the logical circuit resulting from the committed information rate having been exceeded.\n2.

    "text": "So, you suffer from Hay Fever or Allergic Rhinitis and are trying to decide which air purifier is most likely to help you, well you have come to the right place, we have great first hand experience of Hay fever in this office (unfortunately!) , and think we can definitely help to point you in the right direction, read on for our guide on choosing the best air purifier for relief from Hay Fever.\nWhat is the most important thing to consider?\nWhen it comes to removing tree , grass and shrub pollens the most important ingredient your air purifier must have is a good level of suction. Yup, that's right, the air purifier you choose will almost certainly have a filter capable of trapping those allergens, but if it doesn't have enough suction to actually draw them towards it quickly enough then it will not be of much use.\nHow do you work out how quickly an air purifier will gobble up those offending allergens then?\nThe first thing is to compare the CADR ( Clean Air Delivery Rate ) of the machines you are interested in. Generally speaking a higher CADR rating means quicker removal of the offending allergens in your room.\nIn order to be truly effective in gobbling up pollens an air purifier needs to be powerful enough to recirculate all of the air in YOUR room size through its filter as frequently as possible. As a guide, try to choose a machine which has enough air volume to process all the air in your largest room at least 3 times an hour. If you can get one which provides around 4 or 5 times an hour that would be even better.\nThe CADR rating on a box tells a consumer how efficient an air purifier is at actually removing the three main indoor pollutants, namely Pollen, Smoke and Dust. In this case, as a Hay Fever sufferer you should try to choose one where the pollen figure is highest. Clean Air Delivery Rate testing is carried out by an impartial and independent organisation called AHAM - a word of caution here though - not all manufacturers submit their units for certified testing to AHAM and may instead just list their own 'in house' test results on the box. If you want to be certain of what you are buying always choose a machine which has the genuine 'AHAM Certified' Seal on the box.\nBEWARE of the manufacturers over inflated 'recommended room sizes'.\nThis is where we believe most consumers get misled into spending good money on something which is never going to be powerful enough to provide them with genuine relief from their Hayfever. Manufacturers usually state on the product box and specification list that the air purifier is 'For Rooms up to...' and then quote a room size usually given in square metres (m2). This information is completely worthless unless it is also followed by another figure telling you how long it will take to clean the air in that size of room.\nOne blatant example of this currently available on the High Street is an air purifier range manufactured by VAX which on the face of it seems to be reasonable value for money. One of their units available for \u00a3199 in Argos has a Pollen CADR rating of 240. So we know it is capable of removing pollens and according to the manufacturers specification the unit is suitable for rooms up to 103m2. However, when you calculate the CADR rating and divide it into the claimed room size, it shows that the unit would take 65 minutes to clean the air once in a room that size, equating to a very poor 0.93 air changes an hour. Remember, we already know that an air purifier needs to provide at least 3-5 air changes an hour to be genuinely effective at removing allergens!\nAnother VAX unit at \u00a394.99 claims it will remove over 99% of allergens in rooms up to 87m2. Yet once again taking the CADR figure and working out the results clearly shows that this unit will take 69 minutes to purify the air once in that room size, equating to just 0.8 air changes an hour. These air purifiers may well still be effective in reducing Hay Fever symptoms, but realistically the room sizes in which they will be able to perform well are about 5 times smaller than those quoted.\nOK, enough of the technical stuff!\nTo cut through the numbers and make life a little simpler for us all, we have put together a list of air purifiers which we know will provide up to 5 air changes per hour in their recommended room size, and all of which have genuine AHAM certified CADR ratings.

Neither Jen nor I spoke, but in unison we drove forward, blades aloft. Our razor sharp swords sliced through the rough fur like it was fine silk. The bear roared again, but it was too late.\n\u201cGot any funny lines up your sleeve?\u201d Jen asked as the cloud dissipated.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I shrugged, \u201cbut I do have a lab report to write.\u201d With that, we returned to our bodies.\nChloe has risked her life and love to enter the Palace. Now she\u2019s waiting for something to happen. With the Ghetto Chapel to run and the very cute Yair to keep her company, it seems to be smooth sailing. But evil lurks in unexpected places. Will Chloe have the strength to defeat the darkness?\nSeth will do anything to get Chloe back, even leave the world behind. Although upstate New York isn\u2019t very far behind. Seth immerses himself in Boot Camp, determined to learn the intricacies of the Way. With the help of Aron, his old summer camp bunk-mate, Seth charts a path into the Palace. But, in the Palace, the battle is fought on many levels. Seth discovers that to win the battle, he might risk the prize.\nIn honor of the Life in the Palace blog tour, I\u2019m giving away 10 free e-book copies of the sequel, To Call Your Name.\nThe prize will be split, 5 copies over Facebook and 5 over Twitter.\nTo enter either comment on my Facebook page or retweet.\nWinners will be selected by the incredibly scientific method of letting my husband pick names at random and will be notified via private message.",

    "text": "Entering the 12th floor of the Hangzhou National Animation Industry Base, the only tip-off that you haven\u2019t stepped into an internet bar is the absence of smoke. In a quiet, dimly lit room, young designers sit at rows of computers, modeling birds, locomotives and girls wearing capes.\nThis a cartoon command center, one of 16 nationwide. Set up over a three-year period thanks to tax incentives, subsidies and bonuses, the centers are part of Beijing\u2019s ambitious plan to cultivate an animation industry able to contribute 1% of national GDP within 10 years. The figure stood at 0.1% in 2005.\nChina\u2019s short-term strategy seems to be a production blitz coupled with government measures to ensure domestic cartoons are aired. China produced 102,000 minutes of animation in 2007, up 20% from the previous year and 137% from 2005, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.\nIn May, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television extended a 2006 ban on broadcasting foreign cartoons by an hour, creating a daily blackout period that runs from 5 pm to 9 pm. Stations must also show seven minutes of domestic cartoons for every three minutes of foreign output. As a result, Chinese animators claimed a 50% market share last year, up from 15% several years ago.\nBut a torrent of animation minutes does not add up to profits or prestige for most of the country\u2019s 5,400 cartoon companies. Though Beijing dreams of a world-class animation industry to compete with Disney or Dreamworks, a local industry champion is unlikely to emerge soon, as broadcasters still favor studios that produce cheaply and bountifully.\nFor televised animation, broadcasters like CCTV and provincial television stations pay studios by the minute. Higher-quality 3D animation fetches a higher price than 2D. Paying more for better animation should, in theory, attract more viewers, and allow stations to charge higher advertising rates. But state-controlled CCTV is less dependent on advertising revenue than a private broadcaster would be. Filling cartoon quotas \u2013 not boosting TV ratings \u2013 is its top priority. A survey by the China Animation & Comics Association found that only 11% of Chinese teenagers preferred domestic cartoons, compared with 60% who favored ones from Japan.\n\u201cLots of poor-quality animated TV shows are just being made blindly,\u201d said Ye Min, director of the animation series Magic Wonderland, produced by Hangzhou-based Zhongnan Animation.\nMany in the industry point to the low amount CCTV pays studios for their work as a major obstacle toward higher-quality animation.\nCCTV pays a \u201ca few hundred yuan\u201d per minute for animation, but production costs in China average RMB10,000 (US$1,500) per minute for 2D and RMB30,000 (US$4,400) for 3D, said Shen Yuliang, general manager of Zhongnan Animation. Last year, Zhongnan turned a profit for the first time since it was set up in 2005. It is rumored to be one of the only studios in Hangzhou to have crept into the black.\nFor studios, getting paid at all is an improvement over the old system.\n\u201cBefore, it was free for broadcasters to air cartoons,\u201d said Nie Jinxing, media relations manager at Sunchime Cartoon Group, which produces Blue Cat, one of China\u2019s most widely syndicated cartoon series since its launch in 1999. The company came close to bankruptcy in 2001, after spending US$8.7 million on production for a series that was broadcast by 15 television stations for free.\nThough producing cartoons to broadcast pro bono was an extreme, global animation markets aren\u2019t set up much differently. Worldwide, animation companies make very little money from broadcasting, but profit from DVDs, toys and other merchandise that the cartoon programs themselves advertise.\nUnfortunately for Chinese animators, these sources of revenue are virtually non-existent. Merchandizing is underdeveloped, while DVD sales are undermined by China\u2019s virulent pirate market.\nSunchime told Asia Times last year that it estimates the value of Blue Cat and its derivative products at US$582 million annually, but only makes US$14-29 million.\nPiracy and lack of profitability are also dissuading potential foreign investors.\nForeign studios have outsourced labor-intensive, technical animation work to China since the 1990s, but they rarely invest in the country\u2019s animation industry. This results in limited foreign expertise at China\u2019s new animation bases \u2013 one reason the industry is short of creative directors and storytellers.\nA creative vision to shape the millions of cartoon minutes into a world-class industry is not a matter of numbers.",

    "text": "\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.",

    "text": "Be a part of the Robertson valley\u2019s biggest adrenalin rush, the Java MTB Challenge (Enter Here). Head over to Van Loveren Family Vineyards in the picturesque Robertson Valley on 13 October for the Java MTB Challenge to enjoy a fun-filled sporting day for the entire family and breath-taking vineyard views, all while supporting a very worthy cause.\nThe event has built up a loyal following over the years and regulars at the Java MTB Challenge use the race to train for the upcoming Wines2Whales and To Hell and Back. Apart from thrilling MTB and trail running across scenic farmland and mountains, the Java MTB Challenge also offers enticing food stalls, good music, wine tasting, lucky draws, prizes to the value of R40,000.00 and a great vibe!\nRoutes range from a non-technical fun ride which is perfect for families to do together all the way up to gruelling routes for top riders only. For safety reasons, no kids under 16 years will be allowed on the 45km and 80km tracks. All participants will be rewarded with medals and goodie-bags upon crossing that finish line.\nThe 6km MTB route is an easy, non-technical fun ride suitable for small children (parents welcome to ride with).\nThe 20km route is ideal for beginners. It consists mostly of jeep tracks with some single tracks, and is not very technical, with only 250m elevation. Take note that no children under 10 years will be allowed the 20 km track and kids younger than 12 years must be accompanied by an adult rider.\nThe 45km route is suitable for intermediate riders with an elevation of about 850m.\nThe 80km is a gruelling route for the adrenalin seekers. It includes many sections of the 2018 ABSA Cape Epic route as well as virgin territory and custom-built single tracks. The 1600m elevation will thrill even the most seasoned rider.\nRunners can look forward to a 10km vineyard trail run over rugged terrain and crossing the confluence of two rivers. The 276m elevation and rocky terrain will be an exciting challenge for novice and experienced runners alike.\nMTB entrants are reminded to bring and wear their PPA MTB timing boards. R25 can be added for a permanent timing board for participants who do not already have one. PPA members receive their first MTB timing board for free. Replacement boards are R50. The trail run is a self-timed event, so no PPA timing board is required.\nThe Java MTB Challenge is a fundraising platform for local schools and charitable organisations and has raised over R500,000.00 in cash for its local community to date.\nRobertson Primary School, Robertson Preparatory School, Wakkerstroom-Wes Rural School, Jakes Gerwel Educational Trust School, Herberg Children\u2019s Home, Bonnievale Vrybrugers.\nThe main sponsors of the day are Van Loveren and Pick n Pay (Robertson), with additional sponsorships from Monsanto, M\u00f4reson Grondverskuiwers, Ford Rola Motor Group, Lelienfontein Vine Growers and Tekco Packaging.\nright (GPS Coordinates: S33 \u030a52\u201931.3\u201d E 020 \u030a 0\u2019 9.1\u201d).\n@vl_java_mtb (Facebook) and @vl_java_mtb (Instagram).",

    "text": "F1600 Formula F Championship Series alum Aaron Telitz claimed two victories for the Team USA Scholarship and Cliff Dempsey Racing at this weekend\u2019s 43rd annual Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, but fell short of the ultimate prize when he spun into the gravel trap while challenging for the lead in the Final.\nTeammate Michai Stephens, 22, from Evanston, Ill., once again was struck by misfortune in his Semi Final race this morning and was unable to qualify for the Final. Stephens had driven impressively to work his way from 25th on the grid to 12th, only to be forced off the road when veteran driver Rick Morris made a rare mistake while Stephens was in the process of passing him around the outside at Clearways.\nTelitz, 22, from Birchwood, Wis., put on another clinic during his Semi Final round. He made an exemplary start from the pole and led all 15 laps to ensure a place on the front row of the grid for the 20-lap Grand Final. He had to be content with the outside position, due to the fact his Semi Final had been interrupted by two Safety Car periods which ensured a slower average speed than Semi Final 2. Undeterred, Telitz made a good start and immediately began to pressurize race leader Jonny McMullan.\nOn Lap 4, Telitz carried more momentum onto the Brabham Straight and drafted to the left of McMullan on the undulating approach to the first corner, Paddock Hill Bend. The pair ran side-by-side toward the apex of the turn, whereupon Telitz\u2019s car just got away from him and he performed a lazy spin into the gravel trap, from which there was no escape.\nTelitz and Stephens will now regroup and return to action on Thursday at Silverstone for two more days of testing prior to next weekend\u2019s Walter Hayes Trophy event for which over 100 Formula Ford cars are currently entered.",

I guess, on the one hand, that we might be safer if we do: if we assume that every person, in every situation is trying to hurt us for no reason at all, we will always act to protect ourselves. We will never approach a stranger to say hello or ask if they need help; we will never even smile at them as they walk by. We will always lock our doors, our windows, our cars, and we will always ask ourselves if we are leaving ourselves open to attack \u2013 on the street, at work or school, on the bus or train, at the mall, in the park\u2026 but is that how we want to live?\nYears ago, before 9/11, I gave a sermon in which I asked how many people at that Yom Kippur service knew anyone personally who had been murdered. Out of 900 people in the room, four raised their hands. Now I ask you the same question: with the exception of the vile, calculated attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, how many friends, relatives or acquaintances of yours have been murdered, or even suffered serious injury, at the hand of a stranger?\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this before realizing that the answer, for me, is exactly zero. A relative died in World War II, and a college roommate was killed by a rival for his girlfriend\u2019s affections, but not a single friend, relative or acquaintance of mine has been murdered or seriously hurt by a stranger. When I consider how many thousands of people I have known over the course of my life, that\u2019s seems pretty amazing.\nBut is it so amazing? If we listen to the news it sounds like people are being punched in the face every day, on every street corner. However, if we remember that over 8 million people live in New York City, and another 8 \u00bd million live in New Jersey, then our chances of being punched by a random stranger on one day in August seem to be around 16,500,000 to one. And since it hasn\u2019t happened again since that day, the chances are hundreds of millions to one. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the news.\nThe job of any news organization is not, actually, to give us the news; it is to make us watch or listen or click or read, so they can sell whatever it is they sell to stay in business. Our job is to ask ourselves whether the reports of random violence are relevant to us and whether we should adjust our lives in response. If someone told me that a knife-wielding lunatic was seen in my development, you can be sure I would bolt the doors. But hearing that a man in Brooklyn punched a pregnant woman, despicable as it was, does not lead me to the conclusion that I \u201chave to be afraid of everyone.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even mean that every person in Brooklyn has to be afraid of everyone.\nFrom the TSA farce at airports to security cameras monitoring cars at Freehold Raceway Mall, we are told to be afraid all day, every day. News reports make it sound like we are lucky to get through a single day without harm. But our life experiences do not bear this out.\nYes, bad things happen in life. But far, far fewer than we imagine. The news has its place and purpose, but we should not let it define our lives for us.\n\u201cFear everyone\u201d is a terrible motto to live by. We deserve better.",

    "text": "DAYTON OH (Dec. 31, 2013) -- A season of bold new productions and cherished classics will be unveiled when Dayton Performing Arts Alliance announces its 2014-2015 New Horizons Ballet, Opera and Philharmonic season on New Year\u2019s Eve at the Schuster Center. It\u2019s all part of the New Year\u2019s Eve Around the World celebration, one of three DPAA Signature Events this season that combined the talents of Dayton Ballet, Dayton Opera and Dayton Philharmonic.\nSubscriptions for all nine New Horizons series go on sale Thursday, January 2, 2014, at 10 a.m. at Ticket Center Stage (888) 228-3630, www.daytonperformingarts.org and by visiting the ticket location inside the Schuster Center. Renewing subscribers will be given priority seating over new subscribers thru April 30. Single tickets go on sale to the public June 1.\nThe New Horizons season will be announced by DPAA\u2019s three artistic directors Thomas Bankston, Dayton Opera; Karen Russo Burke, Dayton Ballet; and Neil Gittleman, Dayton Philharmonic. DPAA President and CEO Paul Helfrich will also be on stage for the celebratory performance that includes complimentary champagne at intermission and a balloon drop during the finale. The performance will end by 10:30 p.m. and tickets are still available.\nOn September 21 and 22, 2014, the New Horizons season opens with the spectacular Russian Panorama, the first Signature Event. Gittleman and the Dayton Philharmonic, along with opera singers and ballet dancers, perform excerpts from Tchaikovsky\u2019s Eugene Onegin, Mussorgsky\u2019s magnificent coronation scene from Boris Godunov as well as Rachmaninoff\u2019s Vocalise and Borodin\u2019s Polovtsian Dances.\nThe second Signature Event, Classical Destinations, marks the half-way point of the season at New Year\u2019s Eve. Bizet\u2019s opera The Pearl Fishers completes the season\u2019s three Signature Events and again combines all three DPAA art forms.\nDayton Ballet Artistic Director Karen Russo Burke will team with DPAA Composer-in-Residence Stella Sung to create the World Premiere of an exciting new ballet in February 2015\u2019s repertory production Creative Convergence. In March, Peter Pan will be performed for the first time with the full Philharmonic. The aptly named Ghost Stories repertory performance will begin the ballet\u2019s season in October with Amy Seiwart\u2019s Chasing Ghosts, the haunting Giselle Pas de Deux and a World Premiere by Dayton\u2019s own DeShonna Pepper Robertson. The holiday family favorite The Nutcracker returns with nine performances, adding a performance on Monday, December 22, at 4:30 p.m.\nDayton Opera will bring Dead Man Walking to the Midwest for the first time in over a decade in February 2015. Jake Heggie\u2019s opera is based on Sister Helen Prejean\u2019s autobiographical account of her relationships with inmates on death row and the production will involve collaboration with The University of Dayton\u2019s campus wide initiative Rites! Rights! Writes! Bankston recently returned from New York City where he conducted auditions for the new season\u2019s productions of Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute, The Pearl Fishers and Russian Panorama.\nPremier Health\u2019s Classical Series starts and concludes with expansive, red-blooded Russian music when the series moves its Thursday evening performance to Friday. Saturday\u2019s performance remains. Audiences will enjoy music inspired in or by America, France, Austria, Scotland, Argentina, and Britain. To honor the great English composer Benjamin Britten on his 100th Anniversary, Boston Pops Principal Conductor Keith Lockhart will conduct the War Requiem.\nAudience-pleasing artists, both new and returning, will join the instrumentalists of Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Gittleman and Assistant Conductor Patrick Reynolds. In the Kettering Health Network SuperPops series, jazz great John Pizzarelli is back along with newcomers the Texas Tenors, Tiempo Libre and the DPO providing the musical score to the movie classic Singin\u2019 In the Rain. The Rockin\u2019 Orchestra Series includes headliners Indigo Girls and pays tribute to the music of Chicago, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen and The Beatles\u2019 Rubber Soul and Revolver albums. Single ticket sales date for the Indigo Girls, if any remain after Rockin\u2019 Series sales, will be announced at a later date.\nThe Philharmonic introduces its new Sunday Chamber Series featuring the stellar talents of DPO Concertmaster Jessica Hung, the DPO Principal Quartet, Dayton Opera Artists-in-Residence and the DPO Brass and Percussion sections. All concerts will be performed at the intimate Dayton Art Institute Renaissance Auditorium.\nThis is the last season for Graeter\u2019s Symphony Sundaes with three upcoming Mozart concerts in January, March and April at the Dayton Masonic Temple. However, ticket buyers can enjoy their free scoop of raspberry chocolate chip and other ice cream flavors when Classical Connections moves from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon at the Schuster Center. Gittleman will continue the unique Connections format of performance and discussion with four programs, one each on composers Tchaikovsky (with guest violinist Chad Hoopes), Mahler, Shostakovich and Gubaidulina.\nPopular seasonal events, including the DP&L Foundation Family Series\u2019 PhilharMonster and SuperPops\u2019 Hometown Holidays, will be joined by two special events: a Halloween rock and orchestral tribute to the music of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Christmastime performance of Handel\u2019s Messiah at Westminster Presbyterian Church.\nSubscribing to a series offers savings up to 23% over single ticket prices. Subscription for Dayton Ballet is $128 to $288 and Dayton Opera $132 to $321. DPO Classical 9 (which includes the Season Opening Spectacular Russian Panorama and a Wildcard ticket to any performance in the New Horizons season) is $108 to $450 and Classical 6 is $72-$321. Rockin\u2019 Orchestra is $128 to $350, SuperPops $147 to $393, Classical Connections $43 to $138, and Chamber and Family Series are $48 to $80 each. Discounts are available for Seniors, Students, Educators and Military.",

    "text": "The question arises, of course, \u201cWho are or what are they calling?\u201d Some say that the cry is for the four horsemen to come forth. Others say that they are calling for John to come and see. But it seems to me that the cry to \u201cCome\u201d is most consistently used in the book of Revelation to cry out to the Lamb to come and establish His kingdom. But when this happens, as we see in chapter six, the Lamb and His people encounter intense resistance and opposition.\nFour times, the living creatures call out \u201cCome!\u201d Four times, a horseman rides out. The first is armed with a bow (a weapon frequently associated with the enemies of God in Scripture). He goes out conquering and to conquer, we read in verse 2. Ironically, when God\u2019s enemies believe that they are conquering Him and His people (13:7), they are actually being conquered (17:14). The second horseman (v.3) is permitted the right to kill God\u2019s people with the sword. Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 10:34 are likely being alluded to here when He says, \u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\u201d The third horseman (v.5) brings economic hardship upon those who follow the Lamb. They are forced to pay inflated prices or given restricted access to the basic necessities of life. This type of economic oppression is a common tactic of persecutors the world over and it grinds God\u2019s people down. It is one thing to suffer hunger yourself but to watch your children suffer hunger and deprivation because of your faith can be demoralizing and make the temptation to deny Christ all the more attractive. Finally the fourth horseman rides out (v.7), bringing disease and death to the people of God. Deprived, oppressed, and mistreated, it would almost appear that the prayer to \u201cCome\u201d is disastrous to the people of God. But then the fifth seal is broken.\nAnd so we read in verse 11, \u201cThen they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.\u201d This is how God will accomplish His purposes; through those who sacrificially do His will even unto death.\nJesus will come back. The prayers of God\u2019s people and the four living creatures will finally be answered. According to Revelation 6:11, it is when the last martyr has been killed; the last witness has been slain because of his/her testimony. Then God will say, \u201cIt is finished!\u201d (16:17), the gates will be closed, heaven will be sealed, and Christ will return to judge the world. This is seen with the breaking of the sixth seal in 6:12-14. Notice that with this broken seal, as with the previous five, there are prayers being uttered, but this time the prayers ushered forth are from those who have participated in opposing God\u2019s purposes. Rich and poor, powerful and powerless, slave and free, they, like Adam, attempt to hide from the One they opposed.[ii] As creation dissolves into chaos at His coming, they cry out \u201cWho can stand in the day of God\u2019s wrath?\u201d The answer is found in the next chapter; only those who belong to the Lamb are able to stand (7:3)! While the Church may seem to be wounded and bleeding in this world, those wounds are, like those of the Lamb; evidence that Christ\u2019s kingdom is, indeed, coming (Matt. 6:10).\nIn Acts 1:3, Luke introduces his account by informing Theophilus that in the time between Jesus resurrection and His ascension, Jesus gave commands to His disciples and \"presented himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God\" (Acts 1:1-3). In Luke 24:13-35, he recounts how Jesus met up with two of His followers on the road to Emmaus, probably heading away from Jerusalem to a place of safety. Jerusalem had become a hostile place for the followers of Jesus. They had witnessed the crucifixion of their Lord, and despite reports that Jesus had risen from the dead, they obviously had their doubts. They decided that it was time to move on before the followers of Jesus were tracked down as well.\nAs they traveled to Emmaus, Luke records that these two unidentified disciples found themselves engaged in conversation with a fellow traveler about the events that had just taken place in Jerusalem and how Jesus had been killed. The traveler listens to them explaining what they had heard and gone through. Finally he interjects, \"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" (Luke 24:25-26).\nWith that as a basic outline, - suffering followed by glory \u2013 He walked them through the entire story of Scripture (verse 27). With Christ at the centre of it all, the events in Jerusalem began to make sense. The Servant of God had to suffer in order to be glorified.\nWhen the disciples were finally allowed to realize that it had been Jesus, Himself, who had been speaking to them, they raced back to Jerusalem to report to the other disciples what they had experienced. There they found them in a barricaded room, obviously in fear of their lives.\nAs the two disciples recount how Jesus spoke with them, suddenly Jesus appeared in their midst. In verse 45, we read that He opened their minds to understand the Scripture, \"and said to them, \"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem ( Luke 24:46-47).\nChrist\u2019s suffering and rising from the dead was to be shared worldwide. It could not be restricted to one group in one room in one city. The global expansion of the gospel would start with them in Jerusalem, but it would not end there.\nDuring the next thirty-nine days, we read in Acts 1 that Jesus went over the theme of the kingdom of God many times with His disciples. He stresses in verse 4 that they are not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the promised Holy Spirit. Telling people not to leave town may seem like a strange way to launch a worldwide missionary movement.\nActs 1: 8 reads, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.\"\nThe first seven chapters deal with the spread of the gospel in Jerusalem. Chapters 8:1-11:18 record how the message of Jesus is spread throughout Judea and Samaria. Starting in 11:19, the focus is the spread of the gospel to the \"ends of the earth\". When Luke\u2019s account ends in chapter 28, it does so rather suddenly as if to emphasize that the story is not complete; we, the readers, continue the mission. It is clear that Luke\u2019s focus in chapter 28 is not on Paul\u2019s fate but the progress of the gospel. The book does not close with the end of Paul\u2019s life or martyrdom but with Paul, \"proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.\" These last words stand as an encouragement for all followers of Christ to do the same as the gospel continues to be carried \"to the ends of the earth.\"\nThe spread of the gospel, however, begins in Jerusalem. This begs the question, \"Why? Why was this necessary? Why did the proclamation of the gospel have to start in Jerusalem?\" Before we address this question, however, we need to put aside three inadequate explanations that are sometimes proposed.\nFirst, the gospel did not begin in Jerusalem because it was home to the disciples and thus they would find a more ready or receptive audience. Jerusalem was not home for any of the disciples. They were from Galilee, not Jerusalem. The angels in Acts 1:11 addressed them as \"Men of Galilee.\" The people of Jerusalem could easily pick out the disciples by their Galilean accents, even in the dark (cf. Matt.26:73, Luke 22:59). Regional prejudices would not have made Galileans the most suitable messengers for the more urbane citizens of Jerusalem, nor would the disciples have felt at home in the city. Their home was in the smaller towns and rural areas of Galilee.\nThe reality is that there was only one beginning of the gospel. In God\u2019s history there will never be another subsequent Pentecost point. Every later initiative is a down-line fruition of that outpouring and obedience. We are now in the \"the uttermost parts,\" not repeating the scenario reaching of \"our-own-Jerusalem.\" Acts 1:8 is a geographical reference as much as it is a historical one.\nSecondly, the spread of gospel did not begin in Jerusalem because it would be the safest place to start and the disciples would be able to get experience in witnessing before moving on to more difficult or resistant areas. Rather the opposite was true. The most dangerous place on earth for the disciples to start their ministry was in Jerusalem. Avowed enemies with the power to throw them in prison had tried to arrest them in the garden of Gethsemane only days before (Mark 14:50-52; John 18:8-9). They would likely try again.\nThirdly, Jerusalem was not chosen to be the starting place for the spread of the gospel because the city was familiar territory for the disciples where ministry experience would prepare them for more unfamiliar ministry later on. Looking at the gospels, one finds that Jesus and His disciples spent relatively little time in Jerusalem. The urban setting of Jerusalem was unfamiliar to the rural Galileans. As noted earlier, there was a regional rivalry between those of Jerusalem and those of Galilee. Neither thought overly fondly of the other. Had Jesus wanted the disciples to start in more familiar territory to gain experience, He undoubtedly would not have chosen Jerusalem. Besides, the disciples were hardly novices to ministry. They had spent over three years with Jesus. He had sent them out on at least two mission trips already. They were fully prepared apart from one thing: they lacked the Holy Spirit.\nThe implications of this promise [i.e. Acts 1:8] are enormous. First of all, it tells the disciples that they will not be alone in the battle; the Holy Spirit will be in them and with them. Secondly, it makes them aware that this battle is actually not their own; it is God\u2019s initiative and God\u2019s action and concern. They are His ambassadors, fully endowed with His authority and power. Thirdly, whatever they will achieve will be God\u2019s achievement, because God\u2019s Spirit has acted through them.\nJesus spoke seldom of the Holy Spirit\u2019s function, but when He did so, frequently described Him as helper and comforter in persecution (Matt. 10:17-20; Mark 13:9-11; Luke 21:12-19). No wonder that Paul follows the Lord\u2019s example in his catalogue of his sufferings by attributing his endurance to the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 6:6). In Philippians 1:19, he writes, \"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.\" He reminds the Thessalonians, that \"ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost\" (1 Thess 1:6-7).\nSecond, Jerusalem was God\u2019s appointed starting place for the spread of the gospel because there were considerable missiological and theological reasons for doing so. While some might argue that the disciples might have drifted back to the comfort zone of their homes in Galilee had they been allowed to leave Jerusalem, I think it more likely that Jesus' instructions were more missiologically and theologically oriented. Jerusalem was the centre of monotheistic worship on the globe. It was the focal point of God's covenant with mankind. Christianity needed to be seen to be in continuity with what had gone on before in God\u2019s plan, rather than being potentially labeled as a Galilean sect.\nThe ultimate reason for the collection project rests upon the fact that Paul was constrained by prophecies which spoke of the nations coming to Israel to worship its King (cf. Is. 60:4-14; 66:19-24; Ps. 72:8-11). As a result of seeing believing Gentiles coming to Jerusalem (Acts 20:4 with 21:15-19), Paul hoped that Israel would be provoked to jealousy so that it might repent and accept Jesus as its Messiah (cf., Rom. 10:1; 11:11-24). Accordingly, Paul\u2019s priestly gift is the Gentiles themselves (Rom. 15:16) to verify that the God of Israel had also become the God of the Gentiles and that there is now only one people of God comprised of all nations (Gal. 3:28-29; Eph. 3:4-6).\nHence, Paul was careful to make sure to emphasize the continuity between Jerusalem and how God had worked in the past, with the present spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth among the Gentiles. The latter was a result of the unfolding plan of God begun with the Jews, fulfilled in Christ and proclaimed through the Church.\nI maintain that this is why the disciples stayed in Jerusalem, just as they had been instructed. When the Spirit came upon them, they immediately began to witness publicly, despite the risk. When persecution came, they did not scatter. They remained in Jerusalem where it was most strategic \u2013 and the most dangerous.\nThey were arrested, shamed, beaten, censured, but they continued. Eventually, one of them, James, was killed (12:2), but even then they remained, refusing to flee. They made no attempt to hide themselves. They knew that for the gospel to spread most effectively, they needed to remain in Jerusalem. It was only after an angel broke Peter out of prison and told him to leave, that he finally found a safer place out of town, but there is no indication that the rest of the apostles left or that Peter stayed away any longer than was necessary.\nWere the disciples being disobedient to the commission of Christ by staying in Jerusalem? I do not think so. They were being the catalyst by which the Church, itself, spread throughout the world. They were busy laying the foundations for a movement that would shake the known world of their day.\nThey worked in ways that consciously served to advance the spread of the gospel (Acts 6:4). They monitored carefully the expansion of the gospel and when they heard of the gospel advancing, they moved immediately to validate, bless and support it (Acts 8:14-25; 11:22). When it became clear that the churches had multiplied throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, Peter, himself, toured the entire region, helping the Church to increase (9:31-32). It was during this time, that God used him to share the gospel with the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius, demonstrating that God accepts all people into His family, regardless of race. Because the disciples were faithful in remaining in Jerusalem, despite the risks, they were in a position to walk through the door that God had opened to all nations.\nWhat are some of the common themes that come out of this survey?\nPersecution provides more opportunities to witness.\nWhen they fled, the disciples did not go \"underground\". They continued to preach. In Acts, witnessing is always public.\nOpposition inevitably followed the preaching of the gospel. While persecution does cause the Church to scatter in Acts, thereby spreading the gospel, it would be a mistake to conclude the relationship between persecution and church growth is best defined thus. The testimony of Acts is not so much that persecution causes church growth but that church growth and the spread of the gospel tends to cause persecution, as religious and political leaders rise up and try to stop this movement that has \"caused trouble all over the world and has now come here\" (Acts 17:6).\nPersecution came from various sources and in a variety of ways. The explanation for why the believers were persecuted in the book of Acts cannot be traced back to one single reason.\n 24:16 indicates that the disciples were kept from recognizing Him and 21:30 speaks of their eyes being \"opened.\" No fault should be laid on the disciples for failing to recognize their Lord.\n Steven Hawthorne, \"Acts of Obedience\" in Perspectives on the World Christian Movement: A Reader 3rd edition. William Carey Library, 1999:126.\n Josef Ton, Suffering, Martyrdom and Rewards in Heaven. University of America Press, 1997: 315.\n cf. G\u00fcnther Bornkamm, \"The Letter to the Romans As Paul's Last Will and Testament\" in The Romans Debate. ed. Karl P. Donfried. Augsburg Publishing House, 1977: 19. Bornkamm: 18-19 also makes the astute observation that Paul was obviously concerned that the Jewish Christians might not accept this collection and accept such a demonstrate of unity between Jew and Gentile in the church and so he asks for the Roman church to pray that that his service to the saints in Jerusalem would be acceptable to them (15:31).\n Christopher Little, \"Whatever Happened to the Apostle Paul?\" Mission Frontiers, September 2001: 27.\n This concept was first introduced to me by Vernon J. Sterk in his article \"You Can help the Persecuted Church,\" International Journal of Missionary Research. January 1999: 15-18, as he discussed the growth of the Church in the Mexican state of Chiapas. His field research and doctrinal dissertation on the dynamics of persecution led him to conclude that 1) the acceptance of the gospel message leads to persecution, and 2) persecution negatively affects the growth of the Church. However, he notes, the damaging effects can be minimized through an adequate preparation for, and proper response to, persecution. He also notes that an essential part of that response must be the prayers and involvement of the worldwide Church. On a personal note, my research on the biblical theology of persecution and discipleship has been born out of a desire to help prepare the church for and in persecution.",

    "text": "The physician assistant (PAs) field has been named one of the \u201cBest Jobs in America\u201d according to CNN Money, Glassdoor and the Huffington Post. Also named one of the \u201cTop Paying Jobs\u201d by Forbes, along with the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics reporting that employment for PAs is rising faster than the average occupation through 2022, there is no better time to get your career started in the medical field.\nNP PA Recruiters knows how tough it is to find a career in the healthcare industry. We want to help and see you succeed!\nNearly half of all PAs had a higher income from 2014 through 2015 compared to previous years with a slightly higher percentage being optimistic about their future salary for the upcoming year, according to The Clinical Advisor\u2019s 2015 annual salary survey. The average salary amongst all PAs was $105,013. The highest salaries by geographic region were found in the west, with the average being $112,119.\nAs PAs continue to play an integral role in today\u2019s healthcare industry, demand has steadily increased. Over 11,000 jobs are available on Glassdoor alone and AllHealthCare.com reports that most job openings for PAs are in California, Texas, Florida and New York.\nWith a great demand and rising salary, PAs are a necessity in today\u2019s healthcare industry. At NP PA Recruiters, our staff of professionals wants to help you find the perfect beginning in the medical field. We are wholly dedicated to identifying, qualifying and delivering healthcare providers for clinics in need. If you would like to learn more, apply online or give us a call at 956.772.1400 or 214.351.3880.\nA new survey from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners revealed that nurse practitioners (NPs) entering the workforce in 2015 might have picked the best time to jump in. The survey revealed high pay across the board for NPs along with several benefits.\nNurse practitioners are earning high wages. Let us help you get started in the field.\nAccording to the survey, 22.5% of nurse practitioners are paid at an hourly rate. For an NP at a full-time practice, the hourly pay rate hovered around $53.16. The vast majority of NPs (74.7%) are salaried, with their annual base sitting at around $97,083.\nOn top of salary, 30.1% of NPs reported incentive and productivity bonuses. Most (41.3%) received bonuses based on practice revenue or profit, while 31.8% reported bonuses based on quality measures and 27.7% received bonuses based on patient satisfaction.\nAdditional benefits reported in the survey were as follows: 71.9% of employers were reported to offer continuing education reimbursement while others offered 66.7% professional leave to attend conferences or meetings, and 54% of employers covered costs for registration for said conferences and meetings.\nPay for nurse practitioners has risen since 2013 and now is as good a time as ever to join the workforce. Here at NP PA Recruiters, we strive to not just find you a career; we find you the right career. We assign you a consultant that is available 24/7 to help you find your perfect fit. To find out more about how we can help place you in the right position, give us a call or apply online to help get you started.\nHealthcare is one of the strongest fields in our economy. It allows nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) an overwhelming reason to rejoice. The other reason being that both professions saw an increase in salaries last year.\nFull-time salaries increased by more than $5,000 for both fields according to the 2013 National Salary Survey of NPs & PAs, which is an annual survey conducted by ADVANCE for NPs & PAs. Pay scales can also vary depending on market conditions and employers, though information from the salary report is good news for the healthcare industry overall.\nThese figures represent a major increase from numbers recorded in 2012 when NPs made over $8,000 less than what they earned in 2013. The PA salary increase, which rose by $13,000, was slightly higher over the two-year span.\nLast year, the average full-time nurse practitioner earned a salary of $98,817 while the average full-time physician assistant earned $107,268. The results from the survey showed that hourly wages for PAs were the only ones that slightly decreased.\nIf the overall expectations for NP and PA salaries remain constant, then both are on their way to being extremely financially-rewarding professions in the healthcare industry.\nNP PA Recruiters is a full-service healthcare staffing company committed to keeping employers and career seekers informed with up-to-date industry information. Whether you are searching for a new career or are trying to fulfill your staffing needs, our consultants are available to help you achieve your goals.",

    "text": "Emeritas Kerr and his Tocs Borderers patrol are ambushed by Yordist insurgents whilst on patrol.\nEmeritas Kerr began the morning patrol as he always did, with a long forward drop of his well-muscled, tattooed right arm. As the other three Tocs Borderers took their intervals in the snaking Indian single file line behind him, Kerr wondered if they were going to be hit today. Other patrols had taken a walloping in the past month. He and his men had been lucky so far.\nImprovised Explosive Devices (IEDs) created from scavenged military munitions, mines, old fashioned dynamite or in some cases a few hundred pounds of fertilizer, easily found on the surrounding farms outside of the city. Bomb making had seemingly become a fashionable hobby among the remaining Yordist insurgents left behind ensuring the populace remained stirred up and unable to make a normal life for themselves.\nThe squad sighed with relief as one as they rested packs against the cool shady wall of the fountain. It\u2019s bubbling water cool and tranquil to the mind. Kerr filled his pipe and kept watch on the rooftops and alleys as his lads drank water, smoked and hurriedly wolfed down a bit of cold ration. His squad\u2019s chosen man, Craig Cormier, silently chewed on a dry cracker topped with some sort of meat paste as he watched the locals moving by them as they sat. He would bring up the rear of the formation when they moved out on the second leg of the routine patrol.\nThese patrols never took the same route, they always changed, but this precaution was somewhat affected by the fact they had to always cover the same ground. Ground dictated by the confines of their current area of operation this made them vulnerable to sudden attack by a variety of different means.\nThe ten minute respite passed all too quickly.\n\u201cOff and on! Time ta earn yer pay.\u201d Kerr commanded his Borderers. Once again the patrol paced its way along the street, the crowd thinning as they went, until there were only a very few civilians around them. Kerr tensed, his senses on edge as he noted this. Sometimes in Yordist friendly areas the civilians were warned of bad things about to happen. Passing a short row of vendors carts Chosen Man Cormier was startled to see one of the brightly coloured cart balloons seem to catch the breeze and break away from its fellows in the bunch. Cormier\u2019s guts froze as he realized there was no wind!\nKerr felt himself get pushed to the ground by the blast wave before he heard the roar of the explosion close behind him. He tried to focus but his mind was numb. He was slow to react to the stinging chips of brick splattering his body as the incoming 9mm rounds chewed up the walls and suddenly he noticed one of them was, Cormier had charged forward towards the ambush point and was laying down covering fire and yelling for the others to pull themselves together and \u201cGet a bloody move on!\u201d There were civilians screaming and crying all around them as they scrambled to get out of the way of the fighting. The scene seemed surreal as while Kerr could see lips moving and weapons flashes, he couldn\u2019t hear a single sound.\nA copy of IAG001 Firefight 2.0 Killing Streets for the Firefight rules is necessary to play this mission. Also required are two squads of ION Age Muster miniatures.\nThis mission is for two players, with one player taking a Canlastrian squad of Mustermen out on a routine street patrol.\nThe other player commands a squad of Yordist Mustermen insurgents, out to destroy the Canlastrians by any and all means possible.\nThe objective of this mission for the Yordist is to kill every single Canlastrian mercenary, utilizing the surprise blast of a concealed Air Mine and a hidden ambush to do so.\nThe objective of this mission for the Canlastrian player is to survive the initial onslaught, recover and then destroy their attackers. See the special rules for this scenario.\nA line of four street boards running North-South. It is flanked by buildings and alleyways. The alleyways are represented by 2x5 pavement sections. The Yordist player can place three Skimmers (1x2, DS2), two of the big cars (2x2, DF3) and one of the small cars (2x2, DF2) to represent market vendor\u2019s stalls anywhere on the road edges. Then place 2 debris markers randomly on each street board (use 1D6 x 1D6 to determine square, just re-roll any sixes).\nYou have a 105 point veteran squad of Muster troops. One veteran Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have four troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb or two troopers armed with two Hobbes Bombs each. Place the Scouts on any of the P1 starting places at the south end of the battlefield. On game turn one, your patrol will move north with the intent of exiting the north end of the street on the other side of the battlefield.\nThere are no alternate options for this squad.\nYou have a 96 point squad of Muster troops. One Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have up to two troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb each or one trooper armed with two Hobbes Bombs.\nYou also have one Air Mine to place, before play begins secretly designate one Skimmer on the board to be your Air Mine booby trapped vendor cart. It\u2019s placement will designate where your squad will deploy (details below). Its cost is included in the calculated total force points above.\nYour forces do not start the game on the board. Once the Air Mine has detonated and damage calculated, immediately deploy your forces as follows: Place two men in the building across the road, opposite from where the Air Mine/Skimmer was initially placed, on \u2018off-board\u2019 squares adjacent to the road (see special rules for building details and the map for an example of where these deployment squares would be if the centre skimmer was the Air Mine). Then place a stolen 1x2 Skimmer, on any alley entryway of your choice (the front of the vehicle level with the road, example shown on map) at least 2D6 squares ahead of the place where the mine detonates. The Skimmer may immediately move up to 1D6 plus 1 squares, where the remaining two men get out of the vehicle and deploy behind it. Note that on the turn of deployment the Yordists may not move. They may use all of the normal Target Response Options although the two men by the Skimmer are down 1 dice on this first turn. From the following turn Initiative is rolled for as normal.\nThere are two special rules in use for this mission. Please read and apply it in your playing of Firefight for this mission.\n1. IED \u2013 In this mission the Air Mine is used slightly differently to normal. As the Canlastrian patrol is the only one on the table at the start of the scenario, each turn before the Canlastrians move the Yordist player can move any one of the 1x2 Skimmers on the board 1 space towards the Canlastrians. He does not have to move the one with the Air Mine. He may detonate the mine on any turn he wishes before the Canlastrians move. Once detonated and damage calculated he then deploys his forces as above. This rule represents the Canlastrians belief they are moving through a marketplace, and are not expecting an Air Mine to be hidden in one of the vendors carts.\n2. Buildings \u2013 The \u2018off-board\u2019 sections between alleyways are considered to be buildings. After the Air Mine has detonated and the Yordists deployed, the central square of the building they are in which faces each alleyway and the road are considered normal entrances into the building. It costs two general dice to move through. On the accompanying map an example of these entrances are shown, marked by green squares. The Yordists in the building are initially placed adjacent to the wall facing the road. They count as being in Hard Cover when being targeted, it does not affect them firing as per the normal rules.\nThis mission is part of the Pacification Firefight 2.0 Campaign Mission Arc, set after the fall of Bosworth IV, and should be played with other missions in the Arc in the correct order.\nIt may also be played as a stand-alone scenario, in which case it may be expanded by up to two squads of mustermen per side. Or you may try using Retained posts instead of mustermen, or a mix of Mustermen and the Retained to fight the scenario. It makes for a highly entertaining game.\nThis mission is the fifth of a series of missions in a Firefight 2.0 Campaign Arc which is meant to show the difficulties faced by an occupying force in a built up area in time of war. I have drawn upon the reports of recent military experiences in the modern age and have applied them to this mission arc. When the players have finished all of the missions, it is my hope they will be enlightened to the truly difficult job military personnel have when forced by circumstance and orders to occupy and garrison a city in a foreign land.\nThis mission introduces the guerrilla or \u2018small war\u2019 tactic of ambush, which the players will find to be a very deadly game for their soldiers.\nIn play testing this mission, my brave Tocs were able to recover and fight their Yordist foes to a draw twice in three games. The third game a number of fortunate rolls for the Yordist enabled them to wipe out the Canlastrians without losing a man! Such is the fickle hand of Lady Fate.",

One or more officials will be assigned to monitor the broadcast of a competition to help identify and resolve rules issues as they arise.\nWe have our hands up for that job, although our scant knowledge of the Rules of Golf would mean that everyone would get away with anything, much as when we won a hole in match play with a par, we would offer our opponent a bogey, rather than a double, triple, or worse.\nThe USGA will eliminate viewer call-ins from the decision process.\nFor grounding the club in a hazard: Press 1. For failing to replace a mark on the green when it was previously moved to clear another player\u2019s putting line: Press 2. For all other issues: Press 3, or stay on a line and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received.\nSome big name golfers who have in the past gotten nabbed by TV viewers aided by incessant, slow-motion, high-definition replays in the past include Tiger Woods at the 2013 Masters, Dustin Johnson at the 2016 U.S. Open and Lexi Thompson at the 2017 ANA Inspiration.\nWe ourselves called in one time when Greg Norman was hit by his own shot and failed to assess himself the correct two-shot penalty in a tournament in the mid-1980s.\nWe are still on hold for that one, but there is some great hold music on the line.",

Default value FFFFFF (white) is selected when no value supplied for bg color. (Note: no matter whether the symbol # is used in hex code or not.) The online color tester also helps you to select the harmonic color combinations. The complementary, triadic, analogous, split complementary, tetradic and square color schemes in the Color combining guide recommend you the best color groups for the two, three or four color design. You can also pick up the colors from the gradient scale, best brightness (lightness) level from tints or shades scale and the best suitable vibrance level from the saturation scale. Moreover you can pick the color you like from the random color palette generator.

    "text": "How long does it take the flu to evade a vaccine?\nWith all the recent Presidential attention to the threat from the H5N1 Avian Flu, and the many billions now earmarked for stockpiling vaccines and drugs, it seems like a good idea to ask on what time scale the virus might be able to evade these countermeasures. Vaccination is of particular interest, as it is regarded as by far the best tool to combat viral infection at the population level.\nGenomic analyses of H5N1 isolates from birds and humans showed 2 distinct clades with a nonoverlapping geographic distribution. All the viral genes were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses.\nGenetic and antigenic analyses have shown that, compared to previous H5N1 isolates, 2004-2005 isolates share several amino acid changes that modulate antigenicity and perhaps other biological function. Furthermore, our molecular analysis of the HA from isolates collected in 2005 suggests that several amino acids located near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which may affect antigenicity or transmisibility.\nDespite the recent \"Isolation of drug-resistant H5N1 virus,\" (Nature, 20 October 2005), the WHO Global Influenza team determined that recent isolates are \"sensitive to 2 neuraminidase inhibitors that are recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention against human infections.\" So obviously the specific details of which viral isolate one is working with determine its sensitivity to drugs. In the case of the drug-resistant strain, it was isolated in February 2005 from a Vietnamese girl who may have contracted the virus while she cared for her brother. Human-to-human transmission is supported by the girl's lack of contact with poultry and the fact that the neuraminidase gene from virus isolated from the girl was virtually identical to that isolated from her brother. Thus there are evidently drug resistant strains running around in the wild.\nAs far as I can tell, it just isn't yet clear how fast drug-resistance traits can spread. There is now at least a little data about how long it takes a particular viral strain to find work-arounds for vaccines. A recent initial effort to sequence many flu strains in parallel indicates that mutations that provide ways around vaccines can rapidly dominate a population of flu viruses.\nPerhaps the most dramatic finding in our data is the discovery of an epidemiologically significant reassortment that explains the appearance, during the 2003-2004 season, of the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like strain, for which the existing vaccine had limited effectiveness. ...Phylogenetic analysis of 156 H3N2 genomes from our project revealed the clear presence of multiple, distinct clades circulating in the population. Through a reassortment event, a minor clade provided the haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain after the 2002-2003 season.\nThis finding illustrates not only that the influenza virus population contains multiple lineages at any given time, but also that alternate, minor lineages can contribute genetic variation to the dominant lineage, resulting in epidemiologically significant, antigenically novel strains. It is worth emphasizing that our sequence-based sampling approach--in contrast to traditional serologically based sampling--will reveal co-circulating strains even before they become antigenically novel.\nIn other words, the authors assert that amongst viruses that we give the same name there is considerable variation that may be hard to distinguish using traditional techniques. Sequencing the genomes of many isolates can provide a map of how a population of viruses is changing in response to vaccines. Ghedin, et al., note that their work demonstrates significant change of the dominant flu strain even within the 2003-2004 flu season. That variation appeared to originate and then dominate the population of viruses within 12 months.\nWhich brings me to the core of this post, namely that we now have real-world data demonstrating that flu viruses can escape vaccines in less than a year, far shorter than the time it takes to produce significant quantities of effective vaccines. It is important to note that this is a different problem than producing a new vaccine for new annual flu strains every year. If a pandemic strain emerges, our problem is not planning ahead just far enough to deploy a vaccine for next year's strain, but rather to combat a strain already killing people worldwide. It took most of a year for the CDC and Sanofi to come up with a hypothetical H5N1 vaccine, and the new National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza contains the expectation of years to accumulate enough vaccine to be useful for large populations. Never mind that the existing whole virus vaccine may not be effective against a pandemic strain.\nThe fact that the minor Fujian-like clade has donated its HA to the previously dominant strain rather than itself becoming the dominant circulating virus indicates that there may be important amino acid co-substitutions in the other proteins essential for viral fitness.\n...Even within a geographically constrained set of isolates, we have found surprising genetic diversity, indicating that the reservoir of influenza A strains in the human population -- and the concomitant potential for segment exchange between strains -- may be greater than was previously suspected.\nWe cannot think of the H5N1, or any other strain, as either a clonal population experiencing selection or as a bunch of individuals producing descendants that may accumulate mutations leading to a pandemic strain. Rather, flu viruses exists as elements of a population that appear to be constantly innovating and trading parts. This is a critical distinction, particularly in light of rapid human and avian intercontinental travel. Not only have we now learned that there is greater variation in any given set of geographically linked isolates, but because of human travel we can expect all kinds of novel parts to show up in populations that were otherwise isolated and appeared to be of no immediate threat.\nThe Ghedin paper doesn't necessarily teach us directly about the evolution of pandemic flu strains, but it does suggest our current plan for pandemic vaccination is not well suited for the problem at hand.\nAfter studying synthetic vaccines for Bio-ERA, amongst other clients, I think DNA vaccines are the best bet for rapid response on a time scale shorter than flu strains seem to evolve. I've a draft paper on synthetic vaccines in for consideration at Biosecurity and Bioterrorism, and will shortly embark on another paper specifically about distributed manufacture of DNA vaccines. PowderMed is waiting for publication of their (already accepted) first paper on their plasmid vaccine for the annual flu and will be starting trials of an H5N1 DNA vaccine early next year. Unfortunately, it seems the folks in DC aren't taking this technology seriously, and instead blowing billions on developing cell culture production of whole virus vaccines. Even the folks who manufacture vaccines in cell culture acknowledge this will only cut a month or two off the response time.",

So legitimate email from ICIWorld can be trapped in your SPAM FOLDER. Yet each EMail contains information for contacts for potential real estate transactions.

This is the new default setting on ICIWorld Apps now being rolled out for all mobile devices.\nA real estate information service is more like classified ads in a newspaper unlike a real estate board type listing service.\nIn many cases, there is limited information to highlight the opportunity.\nThe advantage is that people who know about these opportunities can present them here for you in the marketplace not available on any other service.\nMore opportunities become available to you as a result.\nThere also can be a link to the full page of information on the brokers or salesperson\u2019s web site if it is on MLS. Make sure you always check Internet Links in each Have or Want.\nSometimes the owners of properties or the Executive Member of ICIWorld who are mainly licensed real estate brokers and salespeople are not at liberty to give you an exact address.\nThis is because there are a lot of exclusive opportunity type properties that are not on real estate boards.\nSometimes an agreement to show the property has to be put in place first before showing you the property or divulging the address of the property to you or identifying the property.\nSo you might see Toronto Restaurant $350,000 Making money . . . and that\u2019s it!\nYou must call the member of ICIWorld, develop and business relationship with him/her and go from there and give them a chance to put an agreement in place first.\nThey may have to put an agreement in place first to show you the property.\nThere are many search methods on ICIWorld to find information.\nIt is helpful for you to understand key word searching.\nThe letters otel are part of the word hotel and part of the word motel.\nSo search the subject line with these letters can find hotels and motels. Try typing otel here in the subject line. You get both hotels and motels because otel is part of each word.\nSearch the subject line and type in your city Try typing you city here in the subject line.\nNaturally you can select a Business AREA along with it, as well as Have or Want.\nAnd now with the age field you can select to search Haves and Wants 30 days old, or 60 -180 days and more.\nOld listings might be old listings but the buildings are still there, the people are still alive hopefully so the contact information can easily lead to networking with the other person to do business. This is one of the true values of this service, is introducing you to people with whom you may be able to do business both on and off the service. Develop a good business relationship with people and it can easily lead to doing other business.\nHaves are the properties for sale and for lease.

    "text": "As much as teachers do all that they can to make their classrooms a place of comfort and security, for some students the school environment can be a stressful one. For a whole gamut of reasons, at some stage during their time spent at school, most kids experience some kind of school-related anxiety. Whether it be separation anxiety in the early years, anxiety about testing and assessment or social anxiety, the reasons are many but the negative effects often the same. Teaching mindfulness is one way that educators and parents alike can help to build the coping skills kids need when they are faced with challenging situations and environments.\nMindfulness is the practice of paying attention, on purpose, to the present moment (Grossman, 2016). It\u2019s something that came so naturally to us as small children, when we could easily spend time silently mesmerised by a single ant wandering across the ground. Though it\u2019s true that as we get older, as our understanding of the world grows wider and our minds subsequently busier, that time spent in silent wonderment doesn\u2019t happen quite so easily.\nTeaching children the conscious skill of mindfulness is an empowering one. The ability to stop, to centre ourselves, to notice what is happening in any given moment goes a long way towards self-regulation and self-awareness. For children who experience anxiety, whether situational or prolonged, having simple and familiar thoughts or actions to call upon during times of stress become important, lifelong skills.\nMindfulness is a superpower that everyone can have. To activate this superpower we only need two things, our mind and our breath. It is for this reason, and so many more, that teaching mindfulness to children is something that should be on every teacher, parent and carers\u2019 radar.\nWith that in mind, here are some fun and simple ways to introduce the concept of mindfulness to young children.\nThis simple activity is a way to teach your child about \u201cbelly breathing\u201d. Centering our thoughts and emotions through our breath is a wonderful self-regulation skill for everyone to learn.\nLay down on the floor beside your child and place a small soft toy, like the little wuppy\u00ae, or any other light-weight object such as a small bean bag or wooden block onto your belly buttons.\nWith your child, lay still and watch the toy move up and down as you both breathe in and out.\nTalk with your child about what you notice. About how quickly or slowly the toy moves.\nYou can also count as your child breathes in \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d and breathes out \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d.\nAnother beautiful child-friendly reframing of a traditional mindfulness practice is to go on a Mindful Safari.\nTake your child outside into nature and tell them that you are both going to go exploring. That you need to discover what creatures, plants and other natural objects are close by.\nTell your child to turn their sense of sight, touch and sound onto high. Remind them that they need to be so, so quiet that they can move around without scaring any little creatures away.\nWhen you find a creature or beautiful object, pause and look at it closely for a while.\nSignal to your child to remain quiet, putting your finger to your lips. They will love the adventure!\nAfter some time spent observing in silence, quietly ask your child some questions.\nThe free Nature Scavenger Hunt Grid on the Teach Starter website can make your Mindful Safari a fun one.\nGuided meditations are a great way to familiarise kids with the language of mindfulness and meditation. There are a number of fantastic apps with free guided meditations. Smiling Minds has great meditations for both children and adults, while Insight Timer is a fantastic free app for adults.\nA \u201cBreathing Colours\u201d guided meditation introduces a simple visualisation to help children focus on using their breath for relaxation.\nAsk your child to think of a relaxing colour. It can be any colour they like, as long as it is one that makes them think of relaxation.\nThen ask them to think of a colour that represents stress, sadness or anger. Whichever of those emotions is most relevant or suitable for your child group to explore.\nWith your spoken guidance, your child imagines breathing in the relaxing colour and visualises it filling their lungs.\nThen they imagine breathing out the stress, sadness or anger colour.\nThere are many ways to teach mindfulness to children. Ultimately, any time that you spend with your child consciously slowing down, and bringing awareness to the moment, will help to build their own repertoire of self-awareness and emotional regulation skills.\nCassie Nguyen is a former school teacher and fellow anxiety-conqueror.

    "text": "Eastern Lightning (\u4e1c\u65b9\u95ea\u7535) or the Church of Almighty God is a Chinese cult based on Christianity who believe that Jesus Christ has been reincarnated as Yang Xiangbing (1973\u2013), a Chinese woman. It was founded in 1989 by Zhao Weishan (\u8d75\u7ef4\u5c71) (1951\u2013), who currently resides in the United States where he continues to lead the church. The name Eastern Lightning is derived from Matthew 24:27.\nAs the Second Coming of Jesus, Yang Xiangbing will guide mankind through the end times. Eastern Lightning preaches salvation through her third testament, The Word Appears in the Flesh. Eastern Lightning refers to the Chinese Communist Party as the \"Great Red Dragon\" of the Book of Revelation, and some members predicted that the world would end on December 21, 2012. The leaders of group, however, rejected that prediction.\nThe group's theology divides time into three ages: that of the law (the Old Testament), that of grace (the New Testament), and that of Kingdom (the current age). It teaches that the \"Age of Grace\" has been superseded by the \"Age of Kingdom\", during which humans will not only be forgiven of their sins, but also cleansed of their sinful nature. There is also a separate \"Age of the Millennial Kingdom\", which is supposed to occur after God's work in China has ended; during that age, the apocalyptic events in the Book of Revelation are to occur.\nThe sect essentially excludes mainstream Christians who are not part of the group from salvation, stating that those who hold on to conventional Christian beliefs are \"guilty of opposing God\" and do not truly believe in Him.\nThe group implicitly denies absolute Biblical inerrancy and explicitly denies the notion that the Bible provides a sufficient understanding of God, condemning such views as Bibliolatry that restricts God via the Bible. Videos on the group's channel render quotations of Jesus in yellow, similar to Red Letter Christians, but also render the group's own The Word Appears in the Flesh in yellow captions to emphasize their belief that the piece of literature is from God rather than a cult leader. The group's view of the Bible as limited and fallible is, however, likely not rooted in rational skepticism of religious dogma and should not be confounded with efforts by progressive Christians to re-interpret the Bible to suit modern science and values. Rather, this is likely intended to prop up the group's theology despite its contradictions with the Bible. For example, the name of the group is, ironically, quote mined right out of a passage about false [[prophets[[ and teachers in Matthew 24:22 that appears to imply that groups like it are following false messiahs.\nDespite believing that all Christians following mainstream beliefs are going to Hell forever, videos on the sect's channel frequently identify the group's members as simply \"Christians\" or \"people who believe in God\". The group also denies evolution.\nLike other Chinese New Age groups such as Falun Gong, the Chinese government considers Eastern Lightning to be a cult and has outlawed the group.\nHowever, unlike Falun Gong, Eastern Lightning has been accused of explicitly engaging in acts of violence. For instance, in 2002 Eastern Lightning allegedly kidnapped 34 members of a Chinese house church network, the China Gospel Fellowship, for two months by pretending to be a Christian training center. According to a victim of the kidnapping, the cultists initially claimed to be theologians from Singapore but later revealed they were actually members of Eastern Lightning; after the victim rebuked them for heresy (cult members had allegedly beaten four Christians in his hometown and left them disfigured), he was called a \"Pharisee\" and moved to a locked room in a residence where he was subjected to verbal abuse. The victim was left pale and emaciated.\nIn a more widely publicized event in 2014, cultists identifying as believers in \"Almighty God\" beat a woman to death at a local McDonald's for simply refusing to give them her phone number. The sect tried to distance itself from the murderers, noting that the suspects testified that they had never come into contact with the church; the sect further accused the Communist Party of being behind the attack. A close look at the testimony shows that the murderers may have been influenced by some of the literature produced by the sect but did not consider the sect to be the true representatives of \"Almighty God\" (Splitters!).\nThe sect produces slick, high-budget \"Christian\" films and uploads them to YouTube. In those movies, all characters, good or bad, invariably use Apple products. Why they have such an obsession with Macs and iPhones remains unexplained.\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 \"Church of Almighty God\".

    "text": "MK Moshe Feiglin in a Knesset committee meeting, next to MK Ahmad Tibi, in 2014. It appears Feiglin is on his way back to the Knesset, while Tibi just sank below the threshold minimum vote.\nAn Israel Hayom poll published Friday morning shows former IDF chief of staff with 19 seats, the Likud down from 30 to 28, the Labor Party falling to its lowest point so far \u20135 seats, Yair Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid stuck in the mud with 9 seats (down from its current 11, which is down from its previous Knesset list of 19), and, for the first time in this campaign, the Zehut (Identity) party, headed by former Likud MK Moshe Feiglin who is a regular pundit at Jewish Press Online, crossing the electoral threshold with 4 seats.\nThe numerous splits of the past few months, on the left and on the right\u2014some of which may end up merging by the official deadline set by the Central Elections Committee, have led to many parties that are swinging just above or just below the: Gesher, headed by Orly Levy-Abekasis, receives 4 seats, while Shas, Meretz, Habayit Hayehudi receive only 3.\nHere\u2019s another doozie: Both Avigdor Liberman and his nemesis Ahmad Tibi get only 3 seats and walk into the setting sun, probably not hand in hand.\nAnd like we said, Zehut, headed by Cool Hand Feiglin, which just held the first open primaries in Israel ever on Tuesday, and did it online (you gave them your ID number and cell number, they SMSed you a code, you clicked in and got to spread 6 points among the candidate/s of your choice) is also on the verge of the electoral threshold \u2013 but for the first time looking at the abyss from above, with 4 seats.\nParties that are so far from the threshold they\u2019re already in Party Heaven (doesn\u2019t that sound like the place you\u2019d want to go when the time comes) are Tzipi Livni and Eli Yishai, each of whom receives but one mandate.\nThe survey examined a scenario according to which Gantz and Lapid unite and bring in former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi. The result: they all get 32 \u200b\u200bmandates, with the Likud pushed to second place with 30, while Labor falls into the 3.25% abyss and goes to pole paradise with a measly 3 seats (down from 24).\nImmediately after Ganz\u2019s speech, the Likud and New Right tried to associate Ganz with the left, while Resilient to Israel, Gantz\u2019s party, what a name) insisted that theirs is a centrist party. Well, the poll showed that 25% of respondents still do not know how to define him.\nAfter the pollsters removed the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d results, 52% of the rest located Gantz at the center, 19% see him as a right-winger, and 29% as left-winger.\nFinal surprise: on the issue of who is more suitable to be the next prime minister, Netanyahu leads safely with 38%, while Gantz gets only 22%.",

    "text": "A new, segmented, negative-strand RNA virus with morphological and sequence similarities to other viruses in the genus Emaravirus was discovered in raspberry plants exhibiting symptoms of leaf blotch disorder, a disease previously attributed to the eriophyid raspberry leaf and bud mite (Phyllocoptes gracilis). The virus, tentatively named raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), has five RNAs that each potentially encode a single protein on the complementary strand. RNAs 1, 2 and 3 encode, respectively, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a glycoprotein precursor and the nucleocapsid. RNA4 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to proteins of unknown function that are encoded by the genomes of other emaraviruses. When expressed transiently in plants fused to green or red fluorescent protein, the RLBV P4 protein localized to the peripheral cell membrane and to punctate spots in the cell wall. These spots co-localized with GFP-tagged tobacco mosaic virus 30K cell-to-cell movement protein, which is itself known to associate with plasmodesmata. These results suggest that the P4 protein may be a movement protein for RLBV. The fifth RLBV RNA, encoding the P5 protein, is unique among the sequenced emaraviruses. The amino acid sequence of the P5 protein does not suggest any potential function; however, when expressed as a GFP fusion, it localized as small aggregates in the cytoplasm near to the periphery of the cell.\nThe GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences reported in this paper are FR823299 (RNA1), FR823300 (RNA2), FR823301 (RNA3), FR823302 (RNA4) and FR823303 (RNA5).\nTwo supplementary figures and a supplementary table are available with the online version of this paper.\nAhn K.

    "text": "Don't worry: The Italians designed the thing to look great at any of its five ride heights.\nYesterday, with a Mediterranean flourish, two women clad in surprisingly-comprehensive dresses pulled a satin sheet from a windswept lump and revealed the new Maserati Levante. It is, as Maserati will tell you, the Maserati of SUVs, though that designation is equal parts meaningful and tautology. The \u201cMaserati\u201d of something\u2014vacuums, lawnmowers, what have you\u2014might be the most graceful and sensuous of its type; were Maserati to paste a trident on a Jeep Cherokee, that too would be a Maserati SUV. With the Levante, Maserati is making a hard case for the former.\nDenuded, the new Levante evokes the shape of much more pedestrian fare: Infiniti's QX60, another wagonoid. That isn\u2019t unfortunate, just a testament to the fact that there are only so many ways to shape a sport utility. (The new Jaguar F-Pace beautifully apes the first-generation BMW X5.) With eyes stolen from Maserati\u2019s Afieri Concept, the Levante harbors as much squinty menace as its Quattroporte and Ghibli siblings and the typical Maserati cues, trident-inspired wheels, scalloped grill and fender portholes work together handsomely. Still, the Levante in person suffers some of what has undermined the Ghibli: a lack of presence. It\u2019s striking but a little stubby, like Peter Dinklage.\nDynamically, the Levante is bound to be athletic. In the U.S., it will come in two guises: The base model, at $72,000, with a 345-horsepower version of the Maserati 3-liter, twin-turbo V-6, and the S, priced around $83,000, with a 424-horsepower version of that same engine. The de rigeur 8-speed ZF transmission will be seamless; adaptive dampers and what Maserati says is the SUV world\u2019s lowest center of gravity will keep things nice and planted, like a ball of burrata dropped on a tile floor. Perfect 50:50 front-rear weight distribution is nice, and gives future owners an excuse to demand passengers take odd seats to maintain balance, like a stewardess on a small regional turbo-prop.\nI\u2019m ambivalent. Unlike the aforementioned F-Pace, or Lincoln\u2019s exuberant Navigator Concept, I didn\u2019t immediately love the Levante. Then again, I had my fingers crossed for a run of original, 1967 Ghiblis suspended over monster-truck tires, which is called \u201csetting yourself up for disappointment.\u201d To muster up some appropriately passionate love for Maserati\u2019s new truck, I talked to Giovanni Ribotta, Maserati\u2019s Chief Exterior Designer. No one can better convince you of a child\u2019s charms that its father. Here are four.\nThe front of the Levante embodies the on-road/off-road duality Maserati wanted for its first truck. A dark, carbon fiber-effect skidplate juts out a touch beyond the bumper, almost like the spoiler of a racing car. According to Ribotta, the skid-plate is self-consciously \u201coff-road, but integrated into a dynamic front.\u201d As far as hammer-screwdrivers go, it\u2019s a cute one.\nRibotta pointed out that, absent bumpers and a couple other modern affectations, the Levante is working in the same design framework as some of Maserati\u2019s most famous coupes. In his words: \u201cThe Levante shape is defined by a strong center spine and the four fenders\u2014as a racing car, from the past. Like the Birdcage or a Type 61.\u201d Does the Mercedes GLC bear the footprint of a 300SL Gullwing? We have yet to hear that case made.\nWhen asked if he might be offended when future Levante owners adorned his streamlined design with awkward racks, rails and boxes, as SUV owners are wont to do, Ribotta smiled graciously. \u201cWe did our roof rails. We designed every accessory that will go on the car. With the engineering team, we tried to make the rails as slender as possible. And as beautiful. We aren\u2019t angry.\u201d If you do buy a Levante and take the thing to Vail, you won't enjoy the transgressive thrill of spoiling a the Levante's slick design. Settle instead for a drive in Maserati's handsome stab at market share\u2014it should be a good one.\nWhat's it like inside Maserati's first-ever SUV? Find out with a 360-degree virtual tour.\nThe Bentley Bentayga Is the Most Expensive SUV. Ever.\nOur first drive goes off-road, while Bentley\u2019s styling team runs off the rails.\nBecause everyone needs an overdesigned mall mauler.\nDrive Wire: Is This Maserati's New SUV in the Arctic Circle?",

    "text": "Venture and Innovation Awards (VIAs) support transformational and innovative research projects by providing financial support and bringing funding into the field of cystic fibrosis (CF) from external sources.\nVenture and Innovation Awards allow short-term projects to take advantage of innovative opportunities and are designed to leverage additional funding. For every pound spent by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust to fund a VIA, an additional four pound has been leveraged from an external agency.\nThe VIA programme is structured as a competitive leverage funding programme, whereby funds will only be awarded following success of an application to an external funding body. External funding bodies include government funding bodies, academic institutions and other medical research charities where applications undergo peer review.\nWe agree VIA funding in principle prior to submission of external funding body applications. Please contact us well in advance of your submission in order for us to consider your application so we can add a letter of support.\nThe VIA programme relies on the science being peer reviewed by the external funding body, thus we can only consider applications where this peer review will take place. For industry awards we request evidence of internal review prior to awarding funding, please contact us for the process.\nIf you wish to apply for a VIA, please contact us researchgrants@cysticfibrosis.org.uk.\nSince we started funding these awards in 2013 we have awarded over 50 grants across a range of different research areas. Descriptions of the types of research we\u2019re funding are listed below, where you can find out more about ongoing projects in the research areas that interest you.\nYou can also see who we have partnered with in each VIA, using our colour-coded labels for: NIHR partner, Charity Partner, Pharmaceutical Partner, Academic Partner, Government Agency Partner and Registry Study\u200b.\nThe timing of lung exacerbations or a worsening of CF symptoms can be very hard to predict. We\u2019re currently funding studies in children and adults to understand more about them. If we can predict when they might happen, then we can treat them quicker and ultimately aim to make them happen less often.\nFind out more about research into lung exacerbations here.\nWhile the symptoms of CF are well known, better ways to manage them are continually being developed, helping to keep people healthier and reducing their effects on quality of life. Our research projects range from ensuring that the way lung function is measured is as accurate as possible, to developing drugs that can help break down the mucus in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about research into managing symptoms here.\nPeople with CF can have a range of different lung infections, and it\u2019s important to know which infections are present and how to treat them. Understanding how bacteria work can lead researchers to spot weaknesses that can be targeted with drugs. The research we\u2019re currently funding includes learning more about the bacteria to identify their weak spots, discovering how to disrupt the formation of \u2018biofilms\u2019 that cause antibiotic resistance and developing methods to speed up the detection of bacteria in samples from people with cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about research into understanding and treating infections here.\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition, caused by damage to the \u2018CFTR\u2019 gene in both copies of the gene. The location of damage within the genes can vary from person to person \u2013 this is what is known as a \u201cgenotype\u201d. Increasingly treatments are focussed on treating people with specific CF genotypes. The research we fund in this area ranges from ways to permanently correct the CFTR gene using gene editing, to early research that is working out ways to repair lung damage caused by cystic fibrosis.\nFind out more about genetic research here.\nThere are different ways to approach therapies for cystic fibrosis. As well as drug therapies, the Trust is investing in gene therapies, which work to replace the damaged gene \u2013 in the case of cystic fibrosis, the CFTR gene \u2013 with a healthy copy of the gene. The Gene Therapy Consortium is a group of researchers based at Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh who are working together to develop gene therapies for cystic fibrosis. Currently, our support for the GTC involves a \u00a3500,000 investment over two years from 2017 \u2013 2019.\nFind out about our research priorities and how and when we are allocating funding to meet these requirements and have the greatest impact on cystic fibrosis research.\nResearchers are investigating a range of issues related to cystic fibrosis, from transplants to bacterial infections and gene therapy.",

    "text": "Many favour Marangu route because it is the cheapest route to the mountain due to few numbers of days during climbing. Marangu route has been referred to as a Coca-cola route because there is no any challenge physical feature which might bring any difficult during climbing only the altitude can be a challenge on this route due to the few numbers of days for acclimatization but it is the only route which you have your accommodation in the Huts but only when you book in advance.\nOn our last day, we have a long trek mostly downhill through the tropical rainforest. Once at the park headquarters at Marangu gate, we collect our summit certificates. A vehicle will meet us here and drive us back to your hotel in Moshi/Arusha.\nYour trekking company is able to pick you up from the airport and bring your to your hotel in Moshi, if needed. A transfer back to the airport can also be arranged.\nThe transport from Moshi to the gate of Kilimanjaro National Park is taken care off. This also applies to the way back.\nUnless you are doing the Marangu Route, you\u2019re staying in our strong and well maintained four season mountain tents. Every time you arrive at your camp the tent has already been set up.\nOn the Marangu Route you will be provided with a bed in one of the huts on the way to Uhuru Peak. There are 60 bunk beds each at Mandara and Kibo Huts, and 120 bunk beds at Horombo Hut.\nDouble layered mats provided by your trekking company will put you to sleep in no time.\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner are prepared during the trek. Your trekking company is bringing their own cook. Don\u2019t be surprised when you see an exclusive three course dinner on your plate.\nDuring the trek you won\u2019t have a shortage on drinking water.\nDon\u2019t expect an extensive shower, but there will be the possibility to use hot water for a decent wash.\nThe guides carry an altitude sickness kit to monitor your pulse rate, oxygen saturation and heart rate twice a day (very useful for monitoring the symptoms of altitude sickness (AMS) at altitude). Also emergency portable oxygen is carried along. On top of that the guides are qualified Wilderness First Responders.\nThe fees for the Kilimanjaro Rescue Team are covered. This is managed by KINAPA, Kilimanjaro National Parks. Interesting fact: Kinapa means \u201cWe carry each other\u201d in Swahili.\nThe park entry fees, the crater fee, camping fee and value added tax are included in the price.\nPer person you generally have a team of 1 guide, 1 cook and 3 porters who will support you in your climb. If you are part of a group of four, you will be able to enjoy 2 guides, 1 cook and 12 porters. Although there will always be enough hands on deck, the exact amount of support staff varies per trekking company.\nVisas are required for all visitors, and cost about $50. For most nationalities it is possible to get a visa upon arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Check with your local Tanzanian embassy or consulate to see what the requirements are.\nThe total amount is also exclusive of flights to and from Tanzania. To get an idea of which airlines are visiting Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA), it is best to have a look at their website.\nYour international travel insurance is your own responsibility. It is important that your travel insurance also covers adventures at a high altitude. Discuss your itinerary with the insurance company before you travel to Tanzania.\nTips for guides and porters are exclusive. You decide what you want to tip, but be generous and read our blog post about tipping when you are planning go trekking in Tanzania.\nWhether you stay in Moshi, Arusha or anywhere else, before and after the trek you have to take care of your own accommodation and meals.\nWhile the intention is to stick to the described route, a certain degree of flexibility is built in. In some cases it may be necessary to change the route here and there. The mountains are full of surprises, and the weather on Mount Kilimanjaro is unpredictable. The guides continuously carry out risk assessments throughout the expedition. It is therefore best to plan a number of extra days in Tanzania to cover for possible unforeseen circumstances. Read all about altitude sickness here.\nUnless you are choosing the Marangu Route, you will be staying in durable tents that are equipped for all weather situations. A few porters will always trek ahead of you to make sure that your tent is ready when you arrive. There will also be tables and chairs. Accommodation comes with freshly prepared meals. Every campsite has a long drop toilet. Along the trek you can find your private space behind a rock. Read all about camping on the Kilimanjaro here.\nDo you reach Uhuru Peak or not? There is a chance that you won\u2019t. Often this depends on the unpredictable weather on the mountain. However, it can also depend on your own physical condition.\nDo you enjoy hiking, have you gone trekking at higher altitudes and do you exercise twice a week on average? With a little extra training, you are soon fit to challenge Mount Kilimanjaro.\nIs this the first time that you are trekking at altitude? Make sure you are well prepared. This is important for your safety, but also for that of your team. Make sure you start six months in advance with an hour\u2019s walk or hike twice a week. Read this blog post and get fit for your Kilimanjaro ascent.\nTrekking in Kilimanjaro requires decent gear. Especially the basics like an 80-90l backpack and quality trekking socks. Also make sure to check our ultimate packing list for trekking Kilimanjaro.\n\u2013 Duffel bag, (waterproof recommended) for porters to carry your equipment.\nBecause Mount Kilimanjaro covers a relatively large surface area and a lot of elevation, the mountain has more or less its own climate. Responsible for the weather patterns around Mount Kilimanjaro are trade winds that bring along moist from the Indian Ocean. Because of these trade winds, the months of March, April, May and November are the wettest. The southern mountain slopes are especially rainy in these months. From January to March there is a greater chance to see snow on and around the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. This can be experienced as negative, but it will any case be much quieter on the trails. Although these are the coldest months, snowfall and cold temperatures can be expected from December to May. The most suitable and most popular season for climbing Kilimanjaro is from June to October. In these months you can choose any route without having to worry about rain too much. If you want a comfortable route during the rainy season, you best choose the Rongai Route, approaching Kilimanjaro from the North. Due to the differences in altitude and the associated climate zones, it is difficult to estimate the temperatures.\nTrekking on Kilimanjaro is hard, both for yourself and your support staff. Per person you have a team who will support you in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. This team usually consists of a guide, three porters and a cook. This way you don\u2019t have to carry your full gear yourself. The guide speaks English and usually the rest of the team speaks English as well. You can make things more interesting by learning a few words of Swahili in advance.\nBookatrekking.com strives to only work with providers who treat porters in a fair manner. Without porters, there is no trekking on Kilimanjaro. They are the heart and soul of your adventure and every day, they carry part of your gear. Bookatrekking.com always tries to find a balance between an affordable trekking adventure and the fair treatment of porters. Read everything about porters on Kilimanjaro here.\nIt is impossible to climb the Mount Kilimanjaro solo. This means that every climber has his or her own team. Both the guide, the assistant guide, the porter and the cook expect a tip. For the whole trek, this sums up to an amount ranging from USD 330 to USD 450. This is per climber, which means that the amount will not be smaller if the group is larger. Be generous. Read our extensive blog about tipping on Mount Kilimanjaro.\nThe currency of Tanzania is the Shilling. We recommend you bring US dollars or Euros to cover the costs of your visa, extra travel, and other. It is easiest to travel in Tanzania with US dollars, but credit cards are also accepted in most places. Before you travel, check with your bank whether your credit or debit card can also be used in Tanzania.\nVisa are required for all visitors, and cost about $50. It is possible to get a visa-on arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Look here at the website of the embassy for arranging your visa.\nTanzania is an area where yellow fever occurs and therefore we recommend you to be vaccinated. We also recommend that you have all other vaccinations such as Tetanus, Diphtheria, Polio and Hepatitis A & B up to date. Malaria is present in Tanzania but there are no mosquitoes at high altitude. Always consult your health professional 90 days ahead of departure.\nHuts but only when you book in advance.",

    "text": "Leading 2017 Isle of Man TT newcomer Adam McLean will be at this year\u2019s Armoy Road Races.\nThe big event will take place on Friday and Saturday, July 28-29.\nJoining McLean, a previous winner of the Junior Support at Armoy, will be local men William Dunlop, Neil Kernohan, Paul Jordan, Darryl Tweed, Paul Robinson, Gary Dunlop, Hexham rider Dominic Herbertson and Moto3/125 GP race winner Christian Elkin, winner of Moto3/125 GP race in 2016.\nWith entries yet to close (July 3) and the 2017 TT just finished, many riders are now turning their attention to Armoy and confirming their attendance.\nThe announcement was made at the official launch of the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019, which was held at Gracehill House, Stranocum yesterday alongside a keynote presentation from David Wallace, the film producer of Road Racers and a local Dunloy man.\nThis year is the 40th anniversary of the original 1977 documentary, which truly captured the heady mixture of three local men, their families and their passion, drive and love of road racing.\nHe gave a short presentation on why and how the film was made but having won two BAFTAs for other work.\nSome key scenes of the film depict the three riders, Joey Dunlop, Mervyn Robinson and Frank Kennedy, riding through the village of Armoy where they often tested their bikes.\nBill Kennedy MBE, Chairman and Clerk of the Course, AMRRC said: \u201cWe are delighted to host, film producer and local man, David Wallace. It is difficult to comprehend that this film, Road Racers, was made 40 years ago, let alone the impact this film would have in years to come, the place it has in people\u2019s hearts and the iconic level that it has reached across the whole road racing community.\n\u201cThe Armoy Road Races came about as most of you know, after a bit of craic in a local pub. It\u2019s hard to believe come September that we will be in our tenth year and that we continue to celebrate all of our road racers, past and present, including the reputed Armoy Armada.\n\u201cIt is also hard to be believe how exceptionally fast 2017 is disappearing but we are on target with our planning. With additional monies from the Department of Communities and some work on the roads, courtesy of Transport NI, these races are set to be one of the best.\n\u201cWilliam Dunlop was man of the meeting in 2016 and I\u2019ve no doubt he will be keen to revisit his Armoy winning streak. As of yet, brother, Michael Dunlop, who retains the title of Race of Legends winner, having won in six successive years has yet to confirm his entry but the Club is hopeful he will race on his home course come July.\nAlso in attendance were the Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Councillor Joan Baird, Terence Brannigan, Chairman of Tourism Northern Ireland, members of the Armoy Club and other guests and sponsors including title &apos;Race of Legends&apos; sponsor, Roadside Kia.\nTerence Brannigan, Tourism NI Chairman also commented: \u201cArmoy Road Races are one of Northern Ireland\u2019s prime motorsport gatherings, attracting motorcycle riders and spectators both locally and internationally.\n\"As the event goes from strength to strength it has an important role to play in tourism, in contributing to the economy and in enhancing our reputation as a destination.\nBill Kennedy concluded: \u201cI\u2019d like to finish by thanking event sponsors Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and Tourism NI for their very kind support.\n\"I\u2019d also like to thank our title sponsor Roadside Kia. Without the support and sponsorship from these organisations and other sponsors present here today, the event just wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nThis year, Bike Week runs from Sunday July 23 until Saturday July 29 with the races taking place on Friday, July 28 and Saturday, July 29 culminating in the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019.\nThe Armoy Road Races are part funded by Tourism Northern Ireland and the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council.",

    "text": "FULL-SCREEN MODEMODE: Click PLAY, then pass your mouse over the bottom right corner of the video screen. The outline of a square will appear. Clicking on it will toggle Full Screen Mode. Press ESC to return to the original format.\nNote: Google Earth software reads the actual topography and ignores roads, cuttings, tunnels, bridges and excavations. The Google Earth vertical-profile animation generates a number of parallax errors, so the profile is only a general guide of what to expect in terms of gradients, distance and elevation. The graph may present some impossible and improbably sharp spikes, which should be ignored.\nGetting there: To approach from the northern side, the pass can be accessed off the R407 about 4 km south of Prince Albert. It is clearly signposted and easy to locate. Head south on the R328 for 2,3 km where the road crosses the Dorpsarivier via a concrete bridge. This point marks the northern start of the Swartberg Pass. This is the direction in which we filmed the pass.\nEerste Water in the northern sector of the pass makes for a perfect spot / Photo: Trygve RobertsFor those wanting to approach from the south, there are a number of options, but we will describe here the obvious main route. Drive north from Oudsthoorn on the tarred R328 via Schoemanskloof. Just after the Wilgewandel Guest Farm (with the camels) there is a fork in the road. The right hand fork heads directly to the Cango Caves. Turn left here (GPS S33.402020 E22.216309) The road (still tarred) heads east for a further 13 km where another guest farm is reached called 'Cobus se Gat'. This marks the southern start of the pass. The road becomes gravel after a further 2 km.\nThe nearest town is Prince Albert - just 4 km from the northern end of the pass. There is plenty see, from flora to fauna, and some mind boggling geology. The fynbos is at its best in winter and spring with proteas, ericas, restios and pin-cushions in profusion.\nThe pass is a national monument and, like its sister pass (Montagu Pass), stands in proud defiance of modern technology. It would be a shame if these roads were ever tarred as their core charm would be lost forever. A plaque commerorating the efforts of the men who built the pass was unveiled on the pass's centenary celebrations in 1988. It stands at the western side of the road at the summit. This was the last pass that Thomas Bain built in the Cape and it was surely his opus magnum. The final cost of the pass, including a few kilometers of access roads, was 14,500 Pounds Sterling, excluding the value of the convict labour, which was free.\nFrom the northern start at the crossing of the Dorpsrivier, the road traverses a short stretch of open plain, but the massive bulk of the looming Swartberg blocks the way ahead, other than a single, narrow gorge through which the road winds. The highest peak visible at this stage is unnamed at 1532m on your left (east), whilst the slightly lower Voetpadsberg on the right (west) tops out at 1402m.\nAmazing geology on display in the northern sector / Photo: Trygve RobertsA low dry packed wall appears on the left as the mountains begin hemming the river and the road in. These walls are the first of hundreds of such examples that you will see along the length of the pass. They were the work of Thomas Bain, then at the height of his engineering prowess as a road builder. The small river, which appears as a docile litlle stream, becomes a raging and destructive torrent when flash floods occur.\nDuring the night of April 10th, 2017, such a flash flood, swept down the kloof, destroying everything in it's path. Thomas Bain's retaining walls, which had been standing guard against the river for 130 years, buckled under the might of the river and the 2 km section of road from Malvadraai through to the northern exit of the poort were completely devastated. It took modern equipment and techniques almost 10 months to repair most of the damage, taking due care to rebuild the wallls to appear as close to Bain's original work as possible.\nThe Swartberg Nature Reserve is large - (180,000 hectares) and provides hiking, picnicking, 4x4 routes, bird-watching, swimming and just being close to nature.\nThe majority of the pass falls within the control of the Swartberg Nature Reserve / Photo: SA VenuesThe moment the kloof is entered, the sunlight is blocked off and the mountains tower vertically up on either side of the road in a dazzling display of contorted sandstone. The rocks often appear blood red, depending on the time of day. The photographic opportunities are endless and there are enough places to pull off the narrow roadway and park safely.\nSome bluegum trees appear on the left and a clearing pops up on the right - a large flat clearing where some ruins are evident. Apparently the house was used by Bain as a work station during the construction phase. Immediately after the clearing, the road bends sharply to the left and approaches the second river crossing via a concreted drift. This is normally shallow and should present no problems for any vehicle. This lovely spot is known as Eerste Water (First Water) and was the first point where oxen and horses could be watered, before tackling the big climb to the summit. There is a rock near this spot - a tall thin slab of rock, which looks like a clock. There is lots of shade at this spot and it makes for a great picnic spot and is well protetcted from the wind too.\nThe pass in the 1800's with its designer - Thomas Bain / Photo: Swartberg Mountain ToursOnce over the river, the road bends to the right and follows the eastern bank of the river. The road has been hewn out of the mountain here and is very narrow. If you meet an approaching vehicle, one of you will need to reverse to a wider section to facilitate passing.\nSoon the road crosses the river for a third time, this time via a low level concrete bridge, which is called Tweede Water (Second Water). Around the next corner is another excellent picnic spot, named Malvadraai. (Wild Geranium Corner) - so named for the wild geraniums that grow there. The section from Tweede Water to Malvadraai also got severely damaged during the 2017 flood.\nOn the left hand side (east) of the river, you will notice a footpath snaking up the mountain-side towards a saddle. This is the 6 hour Malvadraai Hiking Trail and is apparently a lot tougher than its gentle name suggests. Malvadraai is a rest area next to the river, where one normally finds wild geraniums at any time of the year. The river is spotlessly clean and this is a good spot to have a swim on a hot summers day.\nThe road now enters a series of S-bends, and swings away into the south-west up a major kloof, known as Mullers Kloof. This kloof also gave Bain the most trouble. In May 1885 a devastating flood swept across the Swartberg Mountains, washing away most of the road in the adjacent Meiringspoort and causing a long closure. Bains' brand new road also suffered damage, but Bain learned his lessons well and rebuilt the damaged sections of road further away from the river's flood levels.\nThe road also begins climbing more steeply here, reaching a gradient of 1:9. At the 4,4 km mark, there is a layby on the right, which allows access to the ruins, marked as Blikstasie. These ruins were once the convicts home, who constructed the pass.\nAccess to the ruins is awkward and requires some physical effort. Shrubs and trees have overgrown the ruins, but if you have the physical capacity to scramble the few metres up the slope, you will be rewarded with a perfect view of the old walls. These are approximately 2ft thick and consist of rocks and stones held together by mud. The building apparently had an iron roof, hence the name Blikstasie (Tin Station).\nFrom the ruins, if you look up the slope to the left of the road, you will get perfect views of the massive retaing walls that support the road ascending up Mullers Kloof. These are the most impressive of all the walls and at places reach a height of 13 metres! This is also the kloof that was featured in the TV commercial with well known South African singer, song-writer, playwright and actor - David Kramer, chasing his beloved Volksie Bus up one of the hairpins in his trademark red \"veldskoens\".\nThe road climbs steeply into the south-west towards a huge slab of exposed and contorted rockface. It is marked as Droe Waterval (Dry Waterfall) as most of the year this riivulet is without water. If you get to drive this pass around sunset, this rock face glows a deep and fiery red in the setting sun and has earned itself the nickname of \"Wall of Fire\"\nHere you are likely to see baboons and klipspringers, the latter which seem to float up the mountainside with no apparent effort.\nIf you have the time, you will see that as part Bain's dry-walled roads, he constructed underground tunnels to disperse flood waters. The man was a genius and way ahead of his time. An example of this work can still be seen at the \"Droe Waterfall\" which is mostly just a trickle (and aptly named), but when the heavy rains arrive, the gorge is filled with a destructive torrent of white water, capable of sweeping away even the largest of rocks.\nAt Droe Waterval the road curves sharply through 120 degrees to the left and climbs steeply in the process, reaching a gradient of 1:8. Coming up are the famous four hairpins that feature in so many photos of the Swartberg Pass. Drive slowly and carefully and be constantly aware of approaching traffic as the road is narrow here and both vehicles will need to move as far left as possible and pass each other at a crawling speed. Some drivers get so engrossed in the scenery that they forget to keep left. Be constantly aware of meeting an oncoming vehicle on the wrong side of the road.\nThere aren't many places to pull over safely, but there is one good spot right before the third hairpin, which allows a wide scope for photography. It's a great spot to stop and breathe in the clear mountain air and savour the majesty of the impressive landscape. This is one of the Top 5 highlights of the Swartberg Pass.\nOnce up onto the ridge, the gradient eases off a bit to around 1:14 and follows the spine of a long ridge, as the road climbs inexorably towards the viewsite known as Teeberg. The road is wider here and passing oncoming traffic is easier. The Teeberg viewsite is located at the apex of a very sharp right hand bend of 160 degrees. It's at an altutude of 1394m exactly 9 km from the northern start. There is a concrete picnic table here and sufficient parking for about 6 vehicles.\nThe name Teeberg does not appear on any of the topographical maps and the mountain spine that leads upwards terminates at 1535m and is actually called Platberg.\nLooking north one gets a majestic view over the 500m deep chasm that runs all the way down to Malvadraai. The views are quite amazing and if you arrive at this view site on a wind free day, it is a marvellous place to find your soul. The views are 360 degrees and offer so much variety that it's almost impossible to take it all in.\nCautionary: There have been a few incidents on this pass, where people have left there vehicles to take a photograph and not fully applied the handbrake and in one instance, not at all.\nA minivan rolled almost 400m down the cliffs and was obviously a total write-off. Luckily the occupants were out of the vehicle at the time. When stopping at any of the viewsites, it is best practice to switch the engine off, engage 1st or reverse gear if manual, and PARK if automatic PLUS fully apply the handbrake.\nThere are baboons, grysbok, grey rhebuck, klipsringer, leopards and caracal - with the last two seldom being sighted. The road is narrow in certain sections and some reversing might be required to get past an oncoming vehicle. Etiquette is to give way to the ascending vehicle. There are no heavy vehicles or caravans allowed.\nDrive at the speed limit or slower - this road can be dangerous in bad weather. If you plan on stopping at the top for a photo or two, have a windbreaker ready - it can be ice cold out of the car and almost always windy.\nFrom Teeberg the road heads due west as it skirts a side ravine and maintains a fairly level altitude. At the 9,9 km mark, there is a sharp left hand bend, which changes the direction into the SSE, as a flatter section of the upper plateau is traversed. Here the mountain slopes are covered in dense stands of proteas and ericas and if you visit in winter or spring, you will be richly rewarded.\nThe road starts climbing again at a gradient of 1:16 and an intersection is reached at the 10,8 km mark, with another gravel road heading away into the west. This is the turn-off to the famous Gamkaskloof . It is not recommended to drive this road unless you are well prepared, have sufficient fuel, knowledge, and preferably have booked accommodation overnight at Die Hel. This road is slow and a lot rougher than the Swartberg Pass.\nCAUTIONARY: Do not drive this road (Gamkaskloof/Die Hel) unless you have a high clearance vehicle and preferably a 4x4. It is a minimum of a 4 hour trip there and back excluding any stops. It is far better to prebook accommodation at Die Hel and overnight there. The road is a dead-end and consists of about 9 small passes and one big one at the end (Elands Pass). You will be doing this route an injustice by attempting to drive it in a single day. This road is much rougher than the Swartberg Pass.\nSign at the summit now obliterated with stickers / Photo: Sncdn.comAfter negotiating another big right hand bend of 140 degrees and at the 10,8 km mark, the buildings of the old toll house and Swartberg Nature Reserve appear at the next bend. These are used by hikers tackling the Swartberg Hiking Trail.\nThe road now swings through another big S-bend which brings the heading into the east, as the next set of switchbacks begins at the 12,4 km point.\nYou will also notice a locked and gated jeep track heading eastwards just after the picnic spot. This is a known 4x4 route which is some 75 km long. Permits can be obtained from Cape Nature and/or the Swartberg Nature Reserve. There is a minimum number of vehicles required per trip for safety reasons. Immediately before the jeep track junction, some green roofed buildings appear on the left of the road, almost directly below the pass summit. This was originally the site of the road camp where the convicts were housed and perished that snowy night 120 years ago, when their roof caved in. Today, the buildings have been restored and serve as an information centre for the Swartberg Nature Reserve, as well as an overnight hikers hut and a tearoom.\nThe next set of switchbacks consists of four hairpins and whilst they are most impressive, they are not quite in the league of those in Mullers Kloof. The road is also not so narrow and there are more opportunities to stop for sight seeing and photography.\nLooking south from the summit of the pass / Photo: BlogsausbettiesThe third hairpin changes the heading into the west, as the final pull up to the 1575m summit is tackled. Be prepared for cold, blustery conditions at the summit and be aware that there is limited parking. A sticker plastered sign announces: '\"DIE TOP\". This is not the optimum view site on the pass and the weather often spoils things as the wind can really howl through the neck, often reaching gale force conditions. It is much better to stop at one of the three viewsites along the southern descent.\nFrom Die Top, which is a natural saddle in the mountain, you will have expansive views to the south of most of the Klein Karoo, with it's patchwork of green farmlands, whilst the northern vista is entirely different, displaying much drier mountains with a massive gorge splitting the upper mountain plateau into two. It is along the western side of this gorge, that the road has delivered you. From the summit point, the road can be visually traced all the way back to Teeberg. If you are lucky enough to be at the summit alone, switch your car's engine off and listen to the incredible silence or the wind whistling past the rocks at Die Top.\nThe moment the road curves through the sharp left hander at the summit, huge views of green fields and distant grey mountains open up. It is completely different to what has been on offer for the previous 40 minutes. All along the descent there are wonderful examples of Thomas Bain's perfectly constructed dry packed walls.\nPerfect examples of the dry packed supporting walls on the southern side / Photo: PanoramioThe descent is mainly into the east and other than dozens of bends, corners and curves, this direction is maintaned all the way to the valley floor. Maintain a slow and steady speed and make sure you keep well left on all the blind corners.\nCAUTIONARY: The Swartberg Pass is enormously popular with both local and international travellers as can be attested by the many hire cars that can be seen on the pass 7 days per week. Tourists tend to drift completely onto the wrong side of the road as they take in the grand scenery. On the day of filming we had two incidents where we would have had head on collisions, had we been driving faster. Be extra vigilant, blow your hooter as you enter a blind corner, drive with your headlights on and anticipate.\nThere are four view/picnic sites on the southern ascent. If you are planning a picnic, the lowest site might be the most pleasant, as there is nearly always strong wind and cooler temperatures near the summit. The descent lasts for 10,3 kms and should take about 20 minutes to drive excluding stops. Although the pass carries the route number R328 it's administrative number is P0369.\nThe second view site, named Skelmdraai is very good (if the wind is not blowing) with wonderful views and sufficient parking space for about 5 vehicles. From this site, there are excellent perspectives of Bain's propped up walls that run for 2,3 kilometres without a break.\nAt the 18 km mark, there is a substantial ruin on the left hand side of the road (north), followed soon by a big picnic and view site. This is the last view site along the descent, if you intend taking a break. There are another four hairpins coming up, which commence at a ruin called Stalletjie, followed in quick succession by Witdraai. These start at the 20,4 km mark.\nNear the southern end of the Swartberg Pass looking west/ Photo: Thorsten KuttigThe road begins flattening out a little and the road surface improves as the foot of the pass is approached. After the last hairpin (which clears a side ravine), the road changes direction into the south and the road surface switches to tar at the 23,3 km point. The descent gradient remains reasonable and soon a large guest farm makes its appearance on the right hand side, which is Cobus se Gat. This is a good place to get some refreshment, reinflate your tyres and savour all the wonderful memories of driving the amazing Swartberg Pass.\nAs you exit the final section of the pass and access the tar, you will be left with a feeling of awe, relief and disappointment all in one. Relief that you made it through without mishap and disappointment that it's all over. This pass ranks amongst the top 10 South African passes in terms of the total package. There are others which are higher, longer, sharper, more dangerous, but there is only one Swartberg Pass. This is the one pass you must experience at least once in your lifetime.\nIt leaves one with the sense that those responsible for naming the various points up the pass, had exhausted their creative energies by the time they reached the summit (1575m ASL) as the best name they could come up with was Die Top. It must have been a monumental effort.\nThe pass is a national monument / Photo: GoogleHistory: Thomas Bain, with the help of some 250 convict labourers built the pass from 1883 to 1886. He managed to keep the gradient lower than 1:8 throughout the pass, compared to the steeper 1:6 of the Montagu Pass. Bain cleverly used the ridges of the foothills for a comfortable 'altitude gaining' approach to the looming bulk of the Swartberg range, where he chose the lowest saddle as his target.\nIt was tough going and there are many stories that abound about the hardships endured by these pioneering men. When the crest of the pass had been reached during the second winter, a road builders camp had been set up close to the summit. After a particularly heavy snowfall, the roof of the camp collapsed, killing several of the convicts.\nBy this stage of his road building career Bain had developed several unique techniques employing his knowledge of science. One was his dry-walling construction using the principles of cohesion and friction, using no cement at all. This technique was first brought into South Africa by John Montagu and Charles Michell and the first known examples of dry walling to support roads dates to the Montagu Pass (built by Michell) and Bainskloof (built by Thomas Bain's father, Andrew Bain).\nThe other was using heat and water to break big rocks up. A large fire would be lit under or near a difficult rock and then cold water would be poured over it, resulting in the rock cracking into smaller, more manageable pieces. Thomas acquired most of these skills from his father, (and to whom he was apprenticed for a several years), who had an intimate understanding of geology. In these early pioneering days, the tools employed were very rudimentary and consisted primarily of picks, shovels, sledgehammers, gunpowder and hard labour.\nZoom in and out; rotate in any direction.\nUse the Get Route'feature (directly beneath the map): type in your address to get a personalised route straight from where you are to the pass, with time and distance included.\nDetailed written and printable directions.\nDrag the 'little orange man' icon onto the pass for a complete 360\u00b0 tiltable \"street view\".",

Butter, room temp.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Also to stand for 5 minutes.\nAdd the honey, salt, butter, and 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour. Mix at a low speed.\nAdd 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour while the mixer is running. Mix until well combined.\nYou may or may not need to add more flour at this point. You want the dough to come together in a sticky ball that mostly cleans the sides of the bowl, but still sticks to the bottom. Add more flour a little at a time if you need to. Lean more towards a stickier dough than a stiff dough.\nKnead in your mixer for 3 minutes. Then cover and let rise until doubled. This should take about an hour.\nDump risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface.\nShape it into a loaf sealing the seams well.\nPlace the loaf in a bread pan that has been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.\nCover and let rise until doubled (about a half hour to 45 minutes).\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees Bake risen bread for 45-50 minutes. About half way through baking you will need to tent the wheat bread with foil to avoid over browning.\nRun a cube of butter over the top of the hot bread.\nCool 20 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.",

    "text": "Decreasing biodiversity in an ecosystem can increase the spread of disease, research suggests. Researchers studying amphibian communities in natural wetland ecosystems as well as controlled experiments have shown that as diversity increased, infection rates dropped.\nThe rate of extinction of species is increasing as ecosystems across the world come under pressure from habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Recently, changes in biodiversity have been linked to changes in disease risk for humans and wildlife.\nIn the last ten years, a number of studies have reported a correlation between the species diversity within a community and the ability of diseases to spread among that community. This is because some pathogens, i.e. infectious viruses or bacteria, can infect many different species, which differ in their ability to pass on the disease. The authors of this study set out to test the underlying connection between biodiversity and disease prevalence.\nOver three years, they observed the spread of Ribeiroia ondatrae, a pathogen that causes severe deformities and death in amphibians, within 345 wetland ecosystems across a 758,100-hectare region of California, USA.\nA total of 24,215 amphibians were assessed for deformities. In wetlands with low species diversity, the proportion of amphibians carrying and passing on the pathogen was much higher than in those wetlands with a more diverse composition of species. The greater the diversity of species in the wetland ecosystems studied, the higher the number of species more resistant to the pathogen.\nTransmission of the pathogen was 78.4% lower in the in the most species-diverse wetland communities, compared with the least species-diverse. Under laboratory conditions, the researchers observed a 64% decrease in pathogen transmission and infection when the number of species in a controlled community was increased from one to three. In a further experiment using an outdoor, artificially assembled community, total infection rates decreased by 50% when the number of species present was increased from one to four.\nThe study provides evidence of a link between biodiversity and the spread of disease. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that there is plenty of evidence to show that populations with little biodiversity, such as monocultures, facilitate the spread of disease. However, the authors also caution that many other environmental factors, including resource availability, climate and habitat variables will interact to affect the rate of spread of disease within a community.\nThe authors conclude higher levels of biodiversity could help to increase the resilience of wildlife, domestic plants and animals and humans to disease. Conservation efforts should aim to protect and enhance genetic and species diversity as a novel and cost-effective tool in the management of the spread of disease.",

When hot it is an oxidizing agent, the sulfur in it being reduced; sulfur dioxide gas may be released. Hot concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with most metals and with several nonmetals, e.g., sulfur and carbon. Because the concentrated acid has a fairly high boiling point, it can be used to release more volatile acids from their salts, e.g., when sodium chloride (NaCl), or common salt, is heated with concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride gas, HCl, is evolved.\nConcentrated sulfuric acid has a very strong affinity for water. It is sometimes used as a drying agent and can be used to dehydrate (chemically remove water from) many compounds, e.g., carbohydrates. It reacts with the sugar sucrose, C12H22O11, removing eleven molecules of water, H2O, from each molecule of sucrose and leaving a brittle spongy black mass of carbon and diluted sulfuric acid. The acid reacts similarly with skin, cellulose, and other plant and animal matter.\nWhen the concentrated acid mixes with water, large amounts of heat are released; enough heat can be released at once to boil the water and spatter the acid. To dilute the acid, the acid should be added slowly to cold water with constant stirring to limit the buildup of heat.

Since it is dibasic (i.e., it has two replaceable hydrogen atoms in each molecule), it forms both normal sulfates (with both hydrogens replaced, e.g., sodium sulfate, Na2SO4) and acid sulfates, also called bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates (with only one hydrogen replaced, e.g., sodium bisulfate, NaHSO4).\nchemical compound, SO2, a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.

The sulfur dioxide is obtained by burning sulfur, by burning pyrites (iron sulfides), by roasting nonferrous sulfide ores preparatory to smelting, or by burning hydrogen sulfide gas. Some sulfuric acid is also made from ferrous sulfate waste solutions from pickling iron and steel and from waste acid sludge from oil refineries.\nIn the lead chamber process hot sulfur dioxide gas enters the bottom of a reactor called a Glover tower where it is washed with nitrous vitriol (sulfuric acid with nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, dissolved in it) and mixed with nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide gases; some of the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide and dissolved in the acid wash to form tower acid or Glover acid (about 78% H2SO4). From the Glover tower a mixture of gases (including sulfur dioxide and trioxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam) is transferred to a lead-lined chamber where it is reacted with more water. The chamber may be a large, boxlike room or an enclosure in the form of a truncated cone. Sulfuric acid is formed by a complex series of reactions; it condenses on the walls and collects on the floor of the chamber. There may be from three to twelve chambers in a series; the gases pass through each in succession. The acid produced in the chambers, often called chamber acid or fertilizer acid, contains 62% to 68% H2SO4. After the gases have passed through the chambers they are passed into a reactor called the Gay-Lussac tower where they are washed with cooled concentrated acid (from the Glover tower); the nitrogen oxides and unreacted sulfur dioxide dissolve in the acid to form the nitrous vitriol used in the Glover tower. Remaining waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere.\nIn the contact process, purified sulfur dioxide and air are mixed, heated to about 450\u00b0C;, and passed over a catalyst; the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide. The catalyst is usually platinum on a silica or asbestos carrier or vanadium pentoxide on a silica carrier. The sulfur trioxide is cooled and passed through two towers. In the first tower it is washed with oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, 100% sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide dissolved in it). In the second tower it is washed with 97% sulfuric acid; 98% sulfuric acid is usually produced in this tower. Waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere. Acid of any desired concentration may be produced by mixing or diluting the products of this process.\nSulfuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals. More of it is made each year than is made of any other manufactured chemical; more than 40 million tons of it were produced in the United States in 1990. It has widely varied uses and plays some part in the production of nearly all manufactured goods. The major use of sulfuric acid is in the production of fertilizers, e.g., superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate. It is widely used in the manufacture of chemicals, e.g., in making hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfate salts, synthetic detergents, dyes and pigments, explosives, and drugs. It is used in petroleum refining to wash impurities out of gasoline and other refinery products. Sulfuric acid is used in processing metals, e.g., in pickling (cleaning) iron and steel before plating them with tin or zinc. Rayon is made with sulfuric acid. It serves as the electrolyte in the lead-acid storage battery commonly used in motor vehicles (acid for this use, containing about 33% H2SO4 and with specific gravity about 1.25, is often called battery acid).\nAlthough sulfuric acid is now one of the most widely used chemicals, it was probably little known before the 16th cent. It was prepared by Johann Van Helmont (c.1600) by destructive distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) and by burning sulfur. The first major industrial demand for sulfuric acid was the Leblanc process for making sodium carbonate (developed c.1790). Sulfuric acid was produced at Nordhausen from green vitriol but was expensive. A process for its synthesis by burning sulfur with saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was first used by Johann Glauber in the 17th cent. and developed commercially by Joshua Ward in England c.1740. It was soon superseded by the lead chamber process, invented by John Roebuck in 1746 and since improved by many others. The contact process was originally developed c.1830 by Peregrine Phillips in England; it was little used until a need for concentrated acid arose, particularly for the manufacture of synthetic organic dyes.\nH2 SO4, a strong dibasic acid corresponding to the highest oxidation state of sulfur (+ 6). Under usual conditions, sulfuric acid is a heavy, oily, colorless, and odorless liquid. In industry, mixtures of sulfuric acid both with water and sulfur trioxide are also called sulfuric acid. If the SO3: H2 O molecular ratio is less than 1, the mixture is an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid; if it is more than 1, the mixture is a solution of SO3 in sulfuric acid.\nThe compounds H2 SO4\u00b7SO3 (H2 S2 O7, disulfuric, or pyrosulfuric acid, mp 35.15\u00b0C) and H2 SO4\u00b72SO3 (H2 S3 O10, trisulfuric acid, mp 1.20\u00b0C) are also formed. Only water vapor is given off into the vapor phase upon heating and boiling aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid containing up to 70 percent H2 S04. Vapors of sulfuric acid are formed above more concentrated solutions. A solution of 98.3 percent H2 SO4 (azeotropic mixture) upon boiling (336.5\u00b0C) is completely distilled. Sulfuric acid containing more than 98.3 percent H2 SO4 releases vapors of SO3 upon heating.\nSulfuric acid removes water that is chemically bound to organic compounds containing OH, or hydroxyl, groups. The dehydration of ethyl alcohol in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid results in the formation of ethylene or diethyl ether. The charring of sugar, cellulose, starch, and other carbohydrates upon contact with sulfuric acid also derives from the dehydration of these substances. As a dibasic acid, sulfuric acid forms two types of salts: sulfates and bisulfates.\nProduction. The first descriptions of oil of vitriol, that is, concentrated sulfuric acid, were given by the Italian scientist V. Biringuccio in 1540 and the German alchemist whose works were published under the name of Basilius Valentinus in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1690, the French chemists N. Lemery and N. Lefebvre had laid the basis for the first industrial method of obtaining sulfuric acid, a method applied in England in 1740. According to this method, a mixture of sulfur and saltpeter was burned in a ladle suspended in a glass jar containing a certain amount of water. The SO3 generated reacted with the water to form sulfuric acid. In 1746, J. Roebuck in Birmingham replaced the glass jars with chambers made of sheet lead, thus laying the basis for the chamber process for the production of sulfuric acid. Continuous improvement in the process for the production of sulfuric acid in Great Britain and France resulted in 1908 in the first tower system. In the USSR, the first tower installation went into operation in 1926 at the Po-levskoi Metallurgical Plant in the Urals.\nThe raw material for the production of sulfuric acid can be sulfur, pyrite (FeS2), or exhaust gases containing SO2 from furnaces for the oxidative roasting of the sulfide ores of Cu, Pb, Zn, and other metals. In the USSR, most sulfuric acid is obtained from pyrite. Here, the FeS2 is burned in furnaces in the state of a fluidized bed, a state achieved by blowing a rapid stream of air through a layer of finely ground pyrite. The gaseous mixture obtained contains SO2, O2, N2, impurities of SO3, and vapors of H2 O, As2 O3, and SiO2 and holds considerable cinder dust, which is removed from the gas in electrostatic precipitators.\nThe NO produced is converted into N2 O3, or, more precisely, a mixture of NO and NO2, in the oxidizing tower. The gases are then introduced into absorption towers, where they encounter sulfuric acid supplied from the top. It is here that nitrous vitriol is obtained; the mixture is then transferred to the production towers. Thus, there is continuous production and a circulation of nitrogen oxides. The inevitable losses of nitrogen oxides with the exhaust gases are balanced by the addition of HNO3.\nThe sulfuric acid produced by the nitrous method is of insufficient concentration and contains harmful impurities, for example. As. Production is accompanied by the release of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere (\u201cfoxtails,\u201d named for the color of NO2).\nDepending on the amount of water introduced into the process, either oleum or a solution of sulfuric acid in water is obtained.\nIn 1973 the production of sulfuric acid (in the monohydrate) was (in millions of tons): 14.9 in the USSR, 28.7 in the United States, 7.1 in Japan, 5.5 in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4.4 in France, 3.9 in Great Britain, 3.0 in Italy, 2.9 in Poland, 1.2 in Czechoslovakia, 1.1 in the German Democratic Republic, and 0.9 in Yugoslavia.\nUSE. Sulfuric acid is one of the most important products of the heavy chemical industry. The available grades include chamber acid (not less than 75 percent H2 SO4), oil of vitriol (not less than 92.5 percent), and oleum, or fuming sulfuric acid (a solution of 18.5\u201320 percent SO3 in H2 SO4), as well as especially pure battery acid (92\u201394 percent; when diluted by water to 26\u201331 percent, it serves as the electrolyte in lead batteries). In addition, reagent-grade sulfuric acid (92\u201394 percent) is produced by the contact process in quartz or platinum apparatus. The strength of sulfuric acid is determined by the density, which is measured with a hydrometer. Most of the chamber acid is used in the production of mineral fertilizers. Sulfuric acid is used in the production of, for example, phosphoric, hydrochloric, boric, and hydrofluoric acids because of its ability to displace these acids from their salts. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used in separating organosulfur compounds and unsaturated organic compounds from petroleum products. Dilute sulfuric acid is used for the removal of scale from wire and sheets before plating with tin or zinc and for the pickling of metal surfaces before plating with chromium, nickel, or copper. It is used in metallurgy for the decomposition of complex ores, in particular, those of uranium. In organic synthesis, concentrated sulfuric acid is a necessary component of nitrating mixtures and a sulfonating agent in the production of many dyes and pharmaceuticals. Owing to its high hygroscopicity, sulfuric acid is used in drying gases and in concentrating nitric acid.\nSafety measures. Poisonous gases\u2014SO2 and NO2\u2014as well as vapors of SO3 and H2 SO4, present a danger in the production of sulfuric acid. Proper ventilation and hermetically sealed production apparatus are therefore mandatory. Since sulfuric acid causes serious burns of the skin, handling requires extreme care and protective devices (goggles, rubber gloves, aprons, boots). When diluting sulfuric acid, the acid must be poured into water in a thin stream while stirring. Pouring the water into the acid leads to spattering because of the evolution of a great amount of heat.\nSpravochnik sernokislotchika, 2nd ed. Edited by K. M. Malin. Moscow, 1971.\nMalin, K. M., N.

The full program for the carnival can be found here.\nPlease check that you are aware of the timing of your child\u2019s events. There are heats and finals programmed for all track events (except 400m), however if an event only has enough athletes for a single race then a straight final will be run at the time of the scheduled heat. Whilst there are 800m heats and Finals in the program, traditionally the 800m are straight finals (this will be decided on the day).\nPlease note that the times given are \u2018not before times\u2019 they are not competing times.\nThe first Marshalling call for field events will be at 8.10am on both days and athletes will proceed directly to their first field event to Marshall at the competition area.\nThe first Marshalling call on the Track event on both days will be 8.15am for both the circular and straight tracks.\nPlease check the times of your child\u2019s events carefully on the zone program. Field events are listed with a \u201cNot Before Time\u201d. This means that the event will not commence before that time, however it is likely to be marshalled in order to start at the \u201cNot Before Time\u201d. Track times are given down the side of the Track events \u2013 and the track usually runs to schedule. The only time in recent years that we have been late at a zone carnival was a thunder storm delay.\nEnsure you arrive 1 hour before your event, this will enable you to find parking, check in, set up your chairs etc and not be stressed. Your athlete will also have plenty of time to warm up prior to being marshalled.\nFootwear is compulsory for all athletes in all events. For safety reasons Spike shoes are only to be worn during events and must be removed before proceeding to another event.\nSpike shoes may not be worn for athletes in the Under 7, Under 8 and Under 9 age groups.\nSpike shoes may only be worn in track event run entirely in lanes for Under 10, Under 11 and Under 12 age groups.\nFor age groups between Under 13 and Under 17, spike shoes can be worn in all track events (except walks).\nSpike shoes may also be worn in Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump and Javelin where applicable in Under 10 to Under 17 age groups.\nA Maximum 12mm Grass spike may be used at Barton Park.\nPlease check in at your club\u2019s tent, so we know your child has arrived and that you have confirmed for your rostered duty.\nThere will be marshalling calls throughout the day on the loud speaker system. It is the parent\u2019s responsibility to warm up their children and to ensure athletes go to marshalling on time. If an athlete does not turn up for their event at marshalling, it runs without them and they miss out.\nWe would like to remind all parents / caregivers that we do require all children to be accompanied by an adult at the carnival. On arrival at the zone Carnival we would like to ask that one parent / caregiver sign in with their club and check that we have the correct contact details for the attending adult on the day in case of emergencies or any other need to contact you.\nAs the North Metropolitan Carnival is run entirely using volunteers, each club has been allocated a number of jobs.\nPlease sign up for your duties with your club to ensure the smooth running of the zone carnival.\nResults from all the track events are posted on the amenities block, by the canteen. Please check these lists to see if you are in a final.\nUnder 7 Athletes who place in the top three in any Final, will receive a medal in a special medal presentation. You are welcome to take photos of the athletes on the dias.\nAll athletes will receive a certificate detailing all their zone results early in the new year. Athletes from Under 8 to Under 17 who place in the top 6 in their Finals will qualify for Region Championships. Additionally following the completion of the North East Zone carnival, athletes who are the next best 4 athletes from either zone will achieve qualification to the region carnival. Athletes must be in the final to be a subsequent qualifier. All field events are straight finals. Pack starts, 800, 1500 and 3000 are also straight finals. Therefore if you finished 7th or 8th it is likely you will be an additional qualifier to Region and will be notified in early February by your Team Manager.\nThe first 3 relay teams will achieve qualification to region.\n1. Full Centre uniform \u2013 shirt with age patch, Coles patch, individual number visible on the front. See your team manager if you do not have all these patches.\n2. Hat, sunscreen and plenty of drinks. It is a very hot weekend traditionally. If your child has a field event, pack a backpack that can be taken on the field with these items in it.\n3. Make sure you have the right shoes. It is nearly impossible to loan shoes and athletes may not compete barefoot in any event.\n5. Something to sit on \u2013 there is no grandstand, so your own chairs, or groundsheet and possibly shade. Sit in your club area to form a cheer squad for other athletes in your club.\n6. Spray bottles and towels are also a good idea.\nBarton Park is a grass track, so may be affected by heavy rain. Any wet weather notification will be placed on the Parramatta Little Athletics web site www.plac.org.au . However if there is no website notice, all athletes should arrive at the carnival despite the weather and wait for a decision to be made, and this may involve a delayed start. In the event of wet weather please bring plenty of wet weather gear as the carnival is likely to proceed despite wet conditions. Barton Park has lights and so if the carnival is delayed it will proceed until finished in the evening.\nIf you know you cannot attend Region, please notify your team manager by the end of the zone carnival. This may allow another athlete to compete. Your team manager will fill in the notification and forward it to the Zone Committee.",

    "text": "Once in a while here at MBJD Laser we get a chance to do some R&D. (research and development). We have been wanting to do some vector cutting on some fun substrates and it has always intrigued me to try and laser cut Bicycle Playing Cards. Below are a couple picture examples of what we did.\nIts interesting the things you learn along the way as well. A few things to note: A standard deck of playing cards measures 3 1/2\" x 2 1/2\". There are 52 cards in a deck, or 54 if you count the 2 jokers. Our Epilog Zing 40 Watt laser took on average about 40 seconds to laser cut each card. In the examples shown we used Embassy Font. A couple reasons we used embassy font is that it has proven to us to be a popular font, but more importantly the cursive style font connects all the letters together allowing the name to be held in place once the laser cuts it out. As you can see in the photo we purposely attached the first and last letter to the frame of the card so that it would stay in place. (We did have to use a little AutoCAD magic to create the full affect) I'm sure our LXI sign software or Corel Draw could do the same thing.\nWe plan on offering custom laser cut decks of cards in our store soon. These would make great table decorations, novelty gifts, or just fun unique gifts for that hard to shop for person. They make great conversation pieces and fun room decor.",

    "text": "Folio [29.0 x 20.1 cm], 4 books in one volume, (6) ff., 35 ff., (1) f., 48 ff., (2) ff., (14) ff., 31 ff., with more than 300 woodcuts in the text, many of which are full page. Bound in contemporary limp vellum, manuscript title on spine, remnants of ties, red sprinkled edges. Minor soiling and edge wear to binding, front pastedown torn and unglued, book labels of the historian J. B. Bury (861-1927) and Michael Bury (on the front flyleaf) and of the 19th-century English bookseller Samuel Maynard (inside upper cover). Minor spotting and wrinkling to title, mended marginal tear to p.l. 4, the occasional contemporary annotation, minor toning to a few leaves, the occasional minor stain, small marginal burn hole at f. II.42, minor wrinkling and small marginal tear in first quire of Book II, final leaf backed and with moderate toning.\nVery rare, with only one recorded copy in America (Harvard), the first complete edition (see below) of the sculptor and goldsmith Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s (1535-1600) highly influential treatise on the practice of art and architectural theory extensively illustrated with more than 300 woodcuts. This work is important for being \u201cthe first printed and illustrated treatise on artistic anatomy\u201d (Skaarup, 254) and the second published original architectural treatise composed in Spanish, following only Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526). Remarkably (and rather mysteriously), some two dozen of Arfe\u2019s anatomical woodcuts in this work are derived from drawings by Leonardo da Vinci (via intermediary copies), providing a fascinating example of how Leonardo\u2019s graphic work circulated in the wider European art world centuries before his drawings were published (Skarrup, 353-4; R\u00f6hrl, pp. 40-96, 142-45). The De Varia Commensuracion para la Esculptura, y Architectura (1585-7) \u2013 which covers in its four books geometry, human anatomy, the proportions of quadrupeds & birds, as well as classical architecture & contemporary Spanish metalwork \u2013 was the \u201cmost frequently republished\u201d and consulted treatise on artistic practice and theory in Spain up to the turn of the 19th century (see Bonet Correa, p. 145), appearing in ten editions, the early ones being very rare. Its continuing influence has been recognized by its widespread inclusion in libraries of early Hispanic artists on both sides of the Atlantic, characterized by a \u201cmasiva presencia de Vitrubios, Vignolas, Serlios y Arfes\u201d (Soler I Fabregat, p. 149 and passim). The painters Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Alonso Cano are but a few known to have owned a copy of Arfe (Fajardo, 88-90).\n\u201cThe success of the Varia in Spain and in Latin America was extraordinary, being a compendium in a single volume of distinct fields of artistic and scientific knowledge, the borders of which were not at the time established with the same categorical precision as they are today\u201d (Bonet Correa, 157). Books Two and Four are the two most historically influential parts of the Varia. Book Two, on human anatomy, is divided into four subchapters on proportion, osteology, myology and foreshortening of the human figure. Arfe claims here a number of influences, including D\u00fcrer\u2019s treatise on proportion (1528) and Juan Valverde de Amusco\u2019s interpretations of Vesalius\u2019 Fabrica, but he also mentions the artists Pollaiuolo, Baccio Bandinelli, Raphael, Donatello, Mantegna, Michelangelo and the Spaniards Pedro Berruguete and Gaspar Bezerra (ff. 1v-2v). Arfe comes to the practice of artistic anatomy having spent time as a student training in the dissection theater under the direction of the famed physician Cosme de Medina (d. 1591) at the University of Salamanca (f. 25v), leading scholars to remark that \u201cNowhere in an Iberian context was the close, even dependent, relationship between anatomists and artists more evident than in Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s Varia \u2026 the Libro segundo is a rare and unique source produced by an anatomically trained artist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 246). According to Choulant, the Varia \u201cshould\u2026 be considered the earliest of the numerous works which dealt with anatomy for graphic and plastic artists\u2026\u201d (Choulant, p. 32).\nBook Three of the Varia, on the proportions of animals, draws heavily from Conrad Gessner\u2019s four-volume Historiae Animalium (1551-8) and includes, along with depictions of more common birds and quadrupeds, the images of an elephant, camels, ostrich, and D\u00fcrer\u2019s famed rhinoceros. Arfe\u2019s horse recalls the equestrian statues of the Italian Renaissance and serves as a reminder that establishing the precise proportions of the horse was also a preoccupation of such artists as Leonardo (in the Codex Huygens) and Sebald Beham (Proporcion der Ross, 1528).\nIn Book 4, Arfe writes of the Roman ruins in Spain, the architecture of Bramante, Baldassare Peruzzi, and Alberti, as well as modern Spanish architects and those goldsmiths whose work (on liturgical vessels) can be characterized as \u2018micro-architecture,\u2019 beginning with the metalwork of his grandfather. Arfe illustrates the classical Orders based on Serlio, adding a sixth \u2018Attic\u2019 order, and treats various aspects of architectural ornament. At the time of its publication, the Varia was only the second original architectural treatise composed in Spanish \u2013 following Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526) and derivative works of translation such as Villalpando\u2019s Tercero y Quarto libro de Serlio (1552), Zamorano\u2019s Diez Libros de Architectura of Alberti (1582), Miguel de Urrea\u2019s Vitruvio (1582) (Fajardo, 130; Bonet Correa, 158). \u201cArfe\u2019s treatise, with its more timeless character, transcended its own era\u201d (Bonet Correa, 158). Although the Medidas del Romano of Diego Sagredo appeared in three Spanish editions and further French and Portuguese translations, its emphasis on the \u2018Plateresque\u2019 style of architecture contributed to the waning of its popularity during the 17th century, even as the popularity of Arfe\u2019s treatise increased.\nArfe extends Book 4 with a highly original discussion of metalwork, in which he aligns his own specialty with the more theoretically sophisticated field of pure architecture. His woodcuts of liturgical items (monstrance, chalice, aquamanile, crosier, crosses, candelabra, censer, etc.) are given a rigorous proportional treatment, with more sophisticated \u2018micro-architecture\u2019 custodias being shown in plan as well as in elevation, in the manner of full-scale buildings. Some of these illustrations depict surviving works by Arfe, while others are taken to be designs for lost or still unidentified pieces. It should be noted that while Arfe \u2013 despite the popularity of his treatise \u2013 perhaps was unable in his time to elevate his craft as a theoretically complex art alongside painting, sculpture and architecture, in recent times, art-historical research has vindicated his contention that metalwork of the highest quality should be prized not only for its pure material value and symbolic-liturgical importance, but also for its participation in the wider debates about the nature of representation, the supremacy of panting vs. sculpture vs. architecture, etc.\nBooks One, Two and Four of the Varia are dated 1585 on their colophons, while Book 3 is dated 1587. The first two books are occasionally found bound without Books 3 and 4, and it is surmised that the final two books appeared in 1587 (in spite of the 1585 date on Book 4), after an interruption in printing caused by a fire or a controversy about privileges, at which point the complete work was bound together as seen in the present copy (Fajardo, 72-2; Bonet Correa, 159).\nJuan de Arfe was the third in a line of renowned metalworkers originally hailing from Germany \u2013 following his grandfather, Enrique, and father, Antonio \u2013 and is known to have been active in Valladolid, Sevilla, and Madrid. His custodias (monstrances) at the Cathedral of Sevilla and Avila remain celebrated works of Renaissance goldsmithing in the classical mode, showing the influence of Donatello and Bramante, among others. \u201cArfe\u2019s last sculptural works of life-size human figures, such as the exquisite tomb monument for the Archbishop of Seville, Don Crist\u00f3bal de Rojas, reveal his development as a leading naturalist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 253; see principally Sanz, and Fajardo for Arfe\u2019s artistic activity). In addition to the Varia, Arfe published Quilatador de plata, oro y piedras (1572) and Descripci\u00f3n de la tra\u00e7a y ornato de la custodia de plata de la Sancta Yglesia de Sevilla (1587), both short tracts on metalwork.\nThe present copy, intriguingly, carries the apparent signature of Arphe himself on the bottom margin of the title page. This exact signature is also present in the same location in copies now at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a and the Biblioteca de Castilla y L\u00e9on (effaced), a detail which might shed further light on the early publication history of the Varia.\n* Palau 16055; Adams A2003; CCBE s.

Trust me when I tell you, if you walk into a restaurant in Japan, you aren't likely to find teriyaki chicken wings on their menu. That said, Japanese teriyaki sure does turn out a really good version of American chicken wings, however, unlike our traditionally-prepared wings, which are typically plunged into the hot oil of a deep fryer, teriyaki wings, in order to render their signature fall-off-the-bone tender interior with a slightly-crispy, sticky exterior, they require a kinder, gentler treatment.\nBroil until bubbly & charring, turning once, 3 minutes per side. Allow wings to rest, on pan, for 4-6 minutes -- just do it.\nJapanese Teriyaki Meets American Chicken Wings: Recipe yields 1 1/2 cups teriyaki sauce and 16-20 chicken wings.\nCook's Note: While related by sauce, when it comes cooking anything teriyaki-style, depending on what it is, each food gets treated and cooked a bit differently. Two examples are my recipes for ~ Open Sesame: Japanese Teriyaki Steak Skewers ~, and, ~ Japanese-Style Oven-Broiled Teriyaki-Style Cod Fish ~.",

This false accusation has made us into a low-fat society of \u201cI Can't Believe It's Not Butter\u201d huggers.\nBut unlike the popular fats like canola oil, vegetable oil, and wannabe butter spreads, saturated fats (animal fats and tropical oils like coconut oil and palm oil) are actually the healthiest fats you can eat and use in a variety of ways.\nHere are 5 reasons to eat coconut oil, plus 5 ways to use it. (In case you're counting, that adds up to 10.) Including 33 recipes!\nFrom the very beginning of life, saturated fats (coconut oil is 92% saturated) are beneficial. They contain lauric acid, the same fatty acid found in breast milk, which makes them essential for brain development, from newborns to those suffering from Alzheimer's.\nLow-fat dieters may be appalled at the thought, but eating coconut oil will actually help you maintain a healthy weight and boost your metabolism. Saturated fats are directly absorbed into your body for quick energy. They boost metabolism and stimulate weight loss.\nAccording to several doctors, including Dr. Bruce Fife, coconut oil can help protect you from heart disease, cancer, and other degenerative conditions.\n5. Bacteria, fungus, and viruses.\nCoconut oil helps protect your body from bacteria, fungus, and viruses, and increases immune responses in HIV cases.\nBecause your skin is your body's largest organ, it absorbs everything you put on it. Studies show that pre-term babies rubbed down with coconut oil instead of mineral oil had faster weight gain and growth.\n4 . In your mouth.\n5. On baby's sensitive skin.\nCoconut oil is the queen bee of all saturated fats. Use it all over your body, inside and out, and discover a healthy alternative to everything from snacks to toothpaste!\nHow do you use coconut oil? What's your favorite use? What benefits have you noticed?\nCan Coconut Oil Prevent Alzheimer's?\nClick here to check out Cold-Pressed Organic Coconut Oil from our preferred source, Wilderness Family Naturals.\nI use it in my hair, combined with some favorite essential oils. I actually discovered it when I had awful dry, fly away hair. A friend recommended that I use it to keep it tame. I love what it does for that, and for my skin. I use it at night as either a cleanser and/or a moisturizer.\nI need to do better about using it in the kitchen. The coconutty taste is somewhat offputting at times. I really prefer ghee but I know the CO is probably a better choice.\nI use it for everything! Sometimes o. The ends of my hair, as a face cream(especially at night), oil pulling, as makeup remover, I use it for all sorts of burns, and I use it in cooking.I love cooking my kale in it, but also use it as the oil when popping popcorn on the stove.\nI even use it as deodorant. Sounds weird but it works better then anything else I have ever used\u2026 And I have tried everything!\nI know and believe the value of coconut oil and use it in my deodorant every day but I really don\u2019t care for the flavor, especially when cooking. It overpowers everything. I\u2019ve used the refined in cooking but wonder about how much of the benefits remain after the processing.\nWhat coconut oil do you recommend to add with coffee?",

    "text": "September\u2019s Free Book of the Month is here. Get yours now.\nThe story of Joseph offers a vivid picture of redemption, reconciliation, and forgiveness. But it\u2019s so much more than that.\nThe Joseph story is sometimes described by scholars as \u2018the Joseph cycle\u2019. This is a helpful term. In Genesis, there are similarly \u2018cycles\u2019 of stories about Abraham (Gen. 12\u201325) and Jacob (Gen. 26\u201336); and in other parts of the Bible, there is a \u2018David Cycle\u2019 for example (1 Sam. 16\u20131 Kgs. 2) and one about Elijah (1 Kgs. 17\u20132 Kgs. 2). A \u2018cycle\u2019 in this sense is a series of connected and continuous narratives about a central figure, in which the component parts nevertheless have their own separate coherence and integrity\u2014like episodes in a TV drama series perhaps or like the individual parts in a \u2018cycle\u2019 of Medieval mystery plays.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to take a closer look at this classic Bible story, Living the Dream provides easily digestible chunks to help you get the most from it. Each chapter of the book often aligns with a single chapter of the story of Joseph.\nWhile you\u2019re at it, add another book from the same collection for just $0.99!\nThis month only, when you get Living the Dream for free, you can also snag God, Pharaoh and Moses for less than a buck.\nIn God, Pharaoh and Moses, William Ford tackles questions like: why does God send a series of plagues to Egypt?

    "text": "It all started 3 months back when two of us, me and Saquib were chatting over our late night coffee destination about going somewhere far from Bangalore. And, this time the plan was to push our bikes to a 10 days plan and explore a state, if possible. Probable destinations that came to our mind were Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Argument started over coffee and we felt Rajasthan would be too far for us to ride from Bangalore and Maharashtra looks best during monsoon and hence we were left with Gujarat. This was something which each one of us wanted to do, especially visit the Rann of Kutch and I very well knew that this time we are going there for sure as the planning started in full swing. Although it was initially me and Saquib who kicked off with the planning and research, we decided to pull in some close pals of ours who might be interested for this long road trip. Sunil, Tapabrata, Ashish and Eshwari (who would be joining us from Gandhinagar) showed immense interest in our plan and we were more than happy with the group which formed now. We decided to start for the trip on 31st January, 2014 (Saturday) and come back to Bangalore by 11th February, 2014 (Wednesday).\nThe days crossed by and our excitement meter was becoming unstable day by day. We were meeting at times, just to check if everything was on track, ran through the route map again and again so that everyone knows the route very well. Unfortunately, Sunil could only be starting by the second half of Saturday and hence he targeted to join us directly at Gandhinagar.\nFew days before the ride started and we hit a major setback: Saquib had a situation in his office and his could not get the leaves approved. This came as a big blow to get us because he was the person who was the mastermind behind this mega plan and all of us wanted him to be part of our group.\nDay 1 started with me, Tapabrata and Ashish riding from Bangalore and our target was to halt at Pune. We decided to start around 4 am in the morning to avoid all the early morning traffic. Once you are on the road, you hardly get to know what time it is, and it always surprises you. This stretch being arrow straight road, you tend to fall asleep, especially when your tummy is full. With couple of breaks including breakfast, lunch, tea and most importantly, photo breaks, when we reached outskirts of Pune, around 8 pm in the evening and we started looking for lodges along the highway. After few searches, we ended up at a decent enough lodge with an adjoining restaurant where we decided to bunk for the night.\nTarget for Day 2 was to reach Gandhinagar as we had already booked a hotel and the group was supposed to rendezvous at the hotel. So, as planned, we got ready as soon as possible and got out on the highway by 4:45 am. It was chilly as usual and I was shivering with cold, but on the other hand, the roads were completely new for me as this was an unknown territory for me, so feeling cold was at the back of my mind and watching out on the road was always my priority. We crossed beautiful places like Lonavala, Khandala and with the rising sun at the back of a train of hills, the scenery looked beautiful which made us stop at multiple places for pictures. It was an eventful day, starting with 3 of us entering the Mumbai-Pune Expressway by mistake and ended up paying up fine to the cops, to having lip smacking vada pavs for breakfast to sudden increase in the traffic, especially of the tucks and trollers which kept on testing our patience all throughout the highway in Gujarat to getting stuck at the infamous Golden Bridge in Bharuch for 2 hours and last but not the least, falling prey on big potholes on SH 3 near Ahmedabad and losing my taillight. By the time we reached Gandhinagar, it was 10:30 pm and dead tired. Eshwari was waiting for us at the hotel and when enquired about whereabouts of Sunil, we came to know even he had issues with his bike near Mumbai and he could not proceed further as well. That was a moderate blow to our itinerary, but more importantly, we needed some rest.\nRise and Shine Day 3. We got the rest what we wanted, and I found a mechanic to fix my bike's taillight. So, after having breakfast from the hotel, we headed towards Sabarmati Ashram and Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, after which we headed towards Radhanpur. The initial plan of visiting Patan was dropped because of the delay of Sunil's arrival and instead, we decided to approach our next destination, the Little Rann of Kutch. Blissful tarmac all throughout, this is what we expected and heard about Gujarat and everyone of us were happy to ride on them. The more we approached Radhanpur, we noticed a change in the landscapes. We were no more surrounded by lush green fields, rather now we were able to see barren lands welcoming us from time to time, a notable decrease in vegetation. We crossed Radhanpur and headed towards Santalpur where we decided to bunk for the night. Constant touch with Sunil made us aware of him approaching Radhanpur for the night, so he can catch up with us the next day.\nIt was ought to be an exciting day, Day 4 it was. With the help of google location, Sunil met up with us at the guest house we stayed overnight and after sumptuous gujarati breakfast, all 5 of us headed towards Little Rann of Kutch. We approached a village after taking diversion from the NH and the moment we entered the village, there was chaos and obvious interest about us, where we coming from and all those stuff. It was like the entire village has come to greet us. Some older folks asked us where do we intend to go to which I asked about the little rann, they guided us to the right direction. We were already off the tarmac and the path was full with sand and we slowly made our way to the rann. And within few metres, we entered the little rann of kutch. A vast, barren land, with no trees, no water, hot and you could see the horizon all around you. It was an amazing feeling the moment I stepped into the rann. People started parking the bikes and start photo shoot, while I took some time to let the feeling settle down and finally pulled out my camera. Spending a good 1 hour at the little rann of kutch, we headed our way back to the guest house, it was time to check out and head towards Great Rann of Kutch! When we crossed the village of Lodrani, the Sun was getting ready to start its plunge towards the horizon and I started doubting whether we would be able to make it to Dholavira on time. Less I knew that I would encounter something magical on the way that would make us drop the plan of going to Dholavira and would make our day special. We got the first view of white rann few kms after we crossed Lodrani. So beautiful, magical feeling it was with cold rays from Sun over the horizon that we were spellbound with it and ended up stopping. No words can express that feeling and I was already having goose bumps seeing the beauty of nature. It took me quite some time to settle down, and believe that I am here, finally. We were so \"awwed\" by this place that we decided to stay there till the sun set. Mesmerized by the beauty of nature, we slowly started off from the place. We decided to drop the plan of visiting Dholavira because it was already dark and instead we headed towards Samkhiyali where we bunked for the night.\nWe started our Day 5 riding to Bhuj, our base for the next 2 days. It took little time for us to look for a decent accommodation and once we got freshened up, we headed for Kalo Dungar after lunch. We already had the permits prepared on our way though, which was a simple procedure. Kalo Dungar is the highest peak in the entire Kutch region and you get a spectacular view of the white rann from the top. We parked our bikes at one side and started walking towards the view point. Strong wind was gushing on our faces all along. The moment I saw the view of the rann, i seemed to me at the first moment if I am actually dreaming, or is it real! Ashish walked up to me at that very moment and said: \"Can you believe we came this far?\". I could not answer, it was the same feeling even I was having and what I wanted at that point of time was to simply enjoy the view. We continued from Kalo Dungar towards India Bridge in some moment's time. Road has been excellent all throughout the leg of the day and not even a single pothole was to be seen anywhere. We approached India Bridge around 4 pm, took some shots except the bridge (Photography of the India Bridge is prohibited by law), where Sunil went over to the jawans for some chat and in few moments, we made our way back, this time towards the White Rann. We did not want to try Dhordo which was already populated due to Rann Utsav and instead headed towards Jamkundaliya, where there was a BSF check post at the entry of the rann. A Bengali and a Kannada jawan stopped us from entering this restricted area and after few conversations and request, they did let us in the rann. The moment we left the check post, the tarmac vanished and red soiled road started. After few meters even that disappeared and we ended up in a dusty and sandy road. We held our breaths and in no time, we entered the white rann! We could indeed see lot of slush on both sides of the truck-tracks and although, it de motivated us a bit, because we expected a plain surface, but after few meters, all the slush disappeared and we were surrounding by white rann. Anywhere you see, we would see only the horizon with some hills at a distance. This is what we wished for! Everyone started yelling with joy, and roared their bikes on the plain surface of rann! Eshwari, who was on the thunderbird, was so excited that she pushed the accelerator hard and kept the throttle going, and we sped past few Kms. Amazing experience I must say, maybe this is the same experience which people gather at the Salt flats, Bonneville! Eventually she came to a halt trembling with sheer excitement! It was the moment where you feel that you riding all the way to Gujarat from Bangalore is success, all the tiredness vanishes the moment you are here. This was one of my best days yet, less would I be able to forget about the experience. We returned back to Bhuj for the night.\nDay 6 started off as a gloomy day, with Eshwari returning back to Bangalore. We had our bikes serviced at Bhuj and headed towards our next set of destinations, the Lakhpat and Narayan Sarovar. When we approached Lakhpat we could see desert all around us, on both sides of the road and a fort, standing tall in the middle of it. A road made of sand went through the fort with lot of diversions and I took one of them and started going towards one of the walls of the fort. I could see few faces peeping from few houses, eager to ask me about my whereabouts, but I ignored them and continued. After exploring some other lanes in the fort, I headed back to the fort entrance, continuing towards Narayan Sarovar. I must say that the place looked superbly beautiful and I experienced one of the best sunsets of my life here. There was a temple right at the edge of the sea (Koteshwar temple) and it was being maintained by the army. There was a checkpost right at the end of the pier and civilians are normally not allowed to go beyond that point. So, we parked our bikes at the very spot from where we could see the sunset. After good 2 hours spent at that very place, it was time for us to finally leave towards Bhuj.\nDestinations to be covered for Day 7 was Mandvi, before we head towards the another crown of Gujarat, The Gir. Main attractions of the day were the Wind Farm beach, dotted with windmills along the beach and the ship building yard. Both places were worth visiting and it was a delight for us to be there, after which we headed towards Morbi to shelter for the night.\nDay 8 seemed excited as he headed towards Junagadh, the gateway to Gir. We were welcomed by family of our friend who had made arrangements for our stay for the night in Gir at The Wilds Villa resort. The resort did not have any fencing and when inquired, we came to know that the day before, two lions had come over to that very place. Take that! And we were excited. The setup was splendid though with bonfire setup around 3 \"charpai\" where we lied down the moment we completed our dinner.\nWe were all excited to start the Day 9 early with the Gir Safari. However, due to lot of crowd at the ticket counter, we could not manage tickets for the early morning 6:30am one, but got the tickets for the 9:00am safari. As the Gypsy cruised through the jungle trail, we sighted deers, peacocks, langurs and a solitary Asiatic lion. It was not what we expected, but the guide told us that it need sheer amount of luck to sight lions in Gir and most of the safaris go back without even sighting a lion, to which we felt better. We left Gir and headed towards Vadodara, and honestly speaking each none of us were excited anymore, we did not want to leave this exciting and vibrant state and 10 days in this state was simply not sufficient, we felt that we needed at least 10 more days to explore more.\nDay 10 and we headed towards Pune where we were supposed to take shelter for the night. It was a boring ride all through to Bangalore on Day 11 when we finally reached home, exhausted and with a feeling \"We did It\".",

    "text": "What does it mean if my variable rate loan is tied to LIBOR?\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is one benchmark, or index, to which the interest rate on an adjustable (variable) rate loan may be tied. (The \"prime rate\" is another frequently used benchmark.) Any adjustable rate loan or other financial product tied to a benchmark will follow that benchmark\u2019s movements up and down.\nFor example, if the margin (the percentage added to the benchmark rate) on your adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is 1.25% and the LIBOR is 2.5%, your interest rate would be 3.75% (1.25% + 2.50% = 3.75%). In this scenario, if the LIBOR increased a quarter percent, to 2.75%, your new rate would be 4.00% (1.25% + 2.75% = 4.00%). That could be a significant increase on a larger loan, resulting in many thousands of dollars extra interest paid over the life of the loan. Likewise, a lower LIBOR would save you money on interest payments.\nIf you have a fixed rate loan, the LIBOR does not affect you. If you have an adjustable rate loan, your loan documents, and possibly even your monthly loan statement, will tell you if your rate is tied to the LIBOR. If you can\u2019t find the information there, you can call your loan servicer and ask.\nIn the \"LIBOR scandal\" of mid-2012, accusations were made that LIBOR had been manipulated by the banks that determine the benchmark's rate, allegedly since the early '90s, to either make money or to make their bank and the banking system as a whole appear stronger. Because in that particular instance the interest rates had been manipulated downward, average borrowers with LIBOR mortgages, student loans and other forms of credit most likely benefited from the manipulation. However, some consumer and institutional investors may have experienced lower returns on their money.",

    "text": "In our Poppy room you will find our youngest children.\nBabies from 0 \u2013 2 years are cared for in their own dedicated space. No more than 12 babies at any one time create our little perfect paradise.\nHere, babies learn to sit up, roll, crawl and eventually take their first few steps. Following on from the wonderful start life they will have had at home, our staff are trained to meet each baby\u2019s individual needs and routine.\nOur Poppies (and their keyworkers) love to get messy, from paint, sand and water that is on offer all the time, to jelly play, gloop and play dough \u2013 these are just a few of the sensory opportunities we plan daily. As well as this books, construction, home corner and heuristic play make up the rest of the playroom.\nAnd when we are all tired out, there is a cosy sleep area to rest in until our batteries are re charges and we start the fun all over again!!\nJust shortly after your child\u2019s second birthday they will move to the Daisy Room, this is where the fun really begins!!\nHaving newly discovered walking, running and climbing there are lots of physical play opportunities in this room. The children have a large undercover outdoor area allowing them freedom to play in or out at all times.\nThe Daisy team love mess just as much as the Poppy\u2019s and so creative and sensory opportunities continue to be one of the main focuses in here too.\nBeing 2 years old is so exciting, the Daisy children now have more words and love to sing and dance and have so much energy \u2013 from nursery rhymes to stories, train tracks to dollies, dinosaurs to painting pictures there is so much to do, the children never want to go home!!\nThe children in the Daisy room have the opportunity to join in Wiggle and Roll sessions at the local gymnastics club (where Kimberley is a Coach) Yoginis (Yoga for mini people) Dance & Movement Music and Singing sessions.\nMeet our pre-school children, here our eldest children are busy getting \u201cSchool ready\u201d.\nEnjoying all the fantastic opportunities the children downstairs have, Sand, Water, Book, Construction, Painting, Role play and Investigation areas, these children also enjoy numbers and patterns, ICT and computer work. We introduce the children to letters & sounds sessions, with an emphasis on \u201cJolly Phonics\u201d.\nThe Sunflowers have their own delightful roof top garden, which also has an undercover area for all weather play.\nThese children also get to enjoy all the fabulous extra curriculum opportunities as the Daisy\u2019s but also get to go swimming once a week too.\nWe love being outdoors in the Sunflower Room and so use the local park all the time, \u201cMuddyboots\u201d is a part of our curriculum that allows us to explore nature and the world around us, especially as we have the park right on our doorstep!!\nStaff loosely follow the principles of \u201cForest Schools\u201d and with our wellies, waterproofs and water bottles off we go for a fun filled adventure every time!!\nAll our children work towards the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). The children under 3 mainly work on the PRIME AREAS of the curriculum \u2013 *Personal, Social & Emotional Development. *Communication & Language & *Physical Development.\nOnce the children become really secure in these areas, our skilled practitioners then introduce the SPECIFIC AREAS \u2013 *Literacy, *Mathematics *Understanding the World & *Creative Development.\nThe Bluebell room is a multipurpose room, used by different groups throughout the week. Children attending for just the free 15 hour sessions will have their 3 hours per day delivered from here. All children aged 3 \u2013 5 are entitled to a free 15 hours per week place (the term after their 3rd birthday) as well as some 2 year olds.\nSessions are morning or afternoon 8.45am \u2013 11.45pm or 12.15 \u2013 3.15pm.\nThe room is bright and spacious, again with its own garden \u2013 all the usual provision areas can be found from painting and drawing to construction and role play.\nThis room is also used for Breakfast and After school club with pickup and drop offs at Whitegate End, New Moston & St Margaret Marys primary schools.\nHoliday care will be available subject to demand.",

    "text": "Just took a \u201cTrophy of a Lifetime\u201d What\u2019s Next?\nYou have just harvested a trophy of a lifetime maybe it will even make the Boone and Crocket or Pope and Young record books, now what? This experience may not be encountered again for many years for most hunters, so you need to be made aware of the questions a taxidermist will ask you and what you need to Mounted Whitetail Deerask them before contacting a taxidermist. You also know that you will have the animal mounted by a reputable taxidermist. Selecting a taxidermist can be almost as challenging as harvesting your new trophy.\nWhat Room will Display the Mounted Animal?\nWhere are you going to hang your new trophy mount? The room in which the mount will hang is a contributing factor on the pose you will select for the mount. There are so many poses available! If your ceilings are around 8\u2032 high or a basement den, the ceilings are not likely to be vaulted. How tall are the antlers? A full upright taxidermy pose might require the mount to hang low on the wall. There are three basic form poses \u2013 upright, semi-sneak, and full sneak. With an upright form, the neck is in a vertical position almost parallel to the wall. The semi sneak form has the neck and head down at approximate 40 degree angle off the wall. The full sneak pose has the neck at almost 85 degrees from the wall. For a low ceiling, a semi sneak or full sneak may be the better choice for your new trophy mount.\nTime to Interview The Taxidermist!\nWhere can I see some of your work? You need to look at their work very close. Look at the eyes, is it a natural look or does it look like the animal is bug eyed? Feel the back of the head between the antlers and slide your hand down the back of the neck. Do you feel the Stitches they used to sew the hide together? Has the hide shrunk? You will not notice this with true tanned hides.\nFound your Taxidermist \u201dEnjoy\u201d your Trophy!\nThe return time of your trophy mount is not as important as the above questions if you feel you have found the right taxidermist to do the mount for you. It should still be around 1 year, but 1 1/2 years is not uncommon! The Last this is the cost of the mount. How much is it worth to you? If you think you have found the right person to mount the animal the actual cost should not impact your decision. After all you get what you pay for!!\nBe Prepared buy a Quality Knife!\nYour knife is your best friend when you are in the outdoors and trying to survive. The survival knife is a tool that can be used in so many ways; it is the most invaluable tool you may possess. There are literally hundreds of different knives to choose from but you should be choosing one before you leave for the outdoors.\nBuy a Survival Knife that fits YOU!\nSize: You want your knife to be small enough to carry but large enough to be used to cut branches from trees, butcher meat and even for digging.\nSharpness: Your survival knife should be sharp at all times especially when you first purchase it, if it isn\u2019t sharp then, then it never will be.\nBalance: Your knife should have a good balance to it, meaning the blade and handle will complement each other. When you swing the knife, the weight if the blade should be doing a lot of the work. Try a few knives and you will notice how they differ in balance and pick the one that best suits you.\nGood Handle: The handle of the outdoor knife should be comfortable to use and preferably made of wood as this means it won\u2019t slip as much.\nIf possible try and get a knife that is fixed blade. This means that the blade of the knife doesn\u2019t fold in. A fixed blade knife is more reliable and safer to use as some folding knives don\u2019t lock well or can slip and cause injury. Always make sure your knife has a good sheath, leather is the best kind, and that it is sheathed when not in use.\nA Good \u201cSharpening Stone\u201d is a Must!\nThe proper care and maintenance of your knife is extremely important and should be a daily ritual when it is in use. Sharpening the blade is essential and the best way to do this is to purchase a sharpening stone. Diamond sharpeners and other type of sharpeners are good but none of these do as good a job as a sharpening stone in the hands of someone who knows how to use one. Your knife\u2019s blade should be sharpened to a point that is not too steep and is still thick enough not to chip.\nTo properly use a sharpening stone, it is best to dampen it first and then move the blade over the stone in a circular motion on angled so that you are removing the burrs and chips from the cutting edge, you will feel it when you get that perfect angle. When Sharpening the blade it must be simultaneously flipped to get the best cutting edge possible. A sharpened blade should have no burrs and the angle of the cutting edge should be constant.\nYour knife is your best friend when in a survival situation. Choosing the right Survival knife and maintain it by keeping it very sharp knife sharpener are lessons that should be learned before heading to the great outdoors for some Outdoor Survival fun.",

Scott Balcerek directed this new documentary about an unlikely musical partnership between Sterling \u2018Satan\u2019 Magee, a southern-born guitarist and Adam Gussow, a white, younger, Ivy League educated New York suburbanite harmonica player. It traces how Magee, after stints with such greats as Ray Charles, James Brown, King Curtis, got tired of seeing how black artists got exploited and took to the streets of Harlem to play strictly for the people. A chance encounter with Gussow, a grad school drop out and part-time street performer turned into a 12 year collaboration that took from the streets of New York to stages all over the world, a cover story in Living Blues magazine and an appearance in the U2 concert film and soundtrack Rattle & Hum. The doc also covers Gussow\u2019s efforts to reconnect with Magee, who, after suffering a nervous breakdown, stopped performing and all but disappeared, as well as their dramatic return in 2005. Though music plays a formative role , the love and mutual respect they have for each other is what really fuels the film. A doc that will move and inspire.

    "text": "The BMW 328 was the most successful sports car of the 1930\u2019s racing scene. At the time when powerful supercharged \u201cKompressor\u201d machines ruled the racing roost, the BMW 328 Roadster \u2013 weighing just 780 kilograms and developing a modest 80 horsepower in series production form \u2013 was a genuine sensation. The success of the BMW 328 lay in the sum of its parts: rigorously applied lightweight design, ideal weight distribution, aerodynamic lines, the perfect engine and a meticulously tuned chassis delivering flawless roadholding. All of which allowed it to underpin a fresh understanding of what a car could be, one which saw the engine\u2019s output teaming up with the optimum interplay of all the car\u2019s component parts \u2013 and complemented by maximum efficiency \u2013 to achieve success. These qualities enabled the BMW 328 to embody the values that still underpin the BMW brand today: dynamics, aesthetic appeal and a high degree of innovation.\nBMW 328 made its debut at the race track in June 14th, 1936. 34 runners were listed in the sports car category of the International Eifel Race. Seven of these were entered in the 2-litre class, and five were BMWs. Four were \u201cTyp 319/1\u201d cars, the other Ernst Jakob Henne\u2019s snow-white Roadster. The car stood out from the crowd, its body boasting far more flowing forms, a curved front end with a pair of slim, kidney-shaped air intakes similar to those of the BMW 326 presented at the Berlin Motor Show that spring, headlights integrated into the front wings, a low, sloping windscreen and a bulbous rear end. Out of sight, yet most certainly not out of mind after the car\u2019s lap times in practice, was the new engine lurking beneath the bonnet. The sound rumbling to the surface through the bonnet\u2019s two leather securing belts indicated the presence of a six-cylinder unit producing maybe 80 or even 90 horsepower.\nHenne\u2019s dream race and the premiere of the BMW 328 have gone down in N\u00fcrburgring folklore. But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story: the victory of the new sports car, whose internal designation \u201cBaumuster 328\u201d did not appear in any of the gushing race reports, marked the start of a legend.\nAnd so the BMW 328 had taken its maiden victory in its debut outing at the N\u00fcrburgring. The win was to be followed by more than 200 others over a lifespan that lasted into the 1950s. It was a run of success unparalleled by any other model in its class; few other cars have left such an enduring impression on the company\u2019s motor sport history as the BMW 328 with its 2.0-litre straight-six engine.\nAfter the triumph at the N\u00fcrburgring BMW set about conquering race tracks far and wide with a trio of BMW 328 prototypes. The universally positive reaction to the maiden victory of the new BMW sports car at the N\u00fcrburgring had sparked high expectations. There were some initial problems under sustained loads in the French Grand Prix at the high-speed Montlh\u00e9ry circuit, but the flow of fastest laps and victories soon resumed. As early as August that year British BMW im-porter H. J. Aldington swept to glory in the Schlei\u00dfheimer Dreiecksrennen race at the wheel of a BMW 328. And it was Aldington who urged the BMW top brass to enter another race outside Germany. A triumvirate of prototypes in green Frazer-Nash-BMW livery lined up for the Tourist Trophy in Ireland \u2013 and promptly sealed a clean sweep of the top three places.\nSince its maiden outing in the 1936 Eifel Race, the BMW 328 had quickly established an iron grip over Europe\u2019s race tracks. For the engineers in Munich, however, this was no reason to take their foot off the gas. Instead, they worked flat out on increasing the car\u2019s original output of 80 hp. Rival manufacturers had already boosted their engines to something around 110 hp, but a significant rise above that level was not expected. There was certainly little scope to further reduce the weight of what was already a lightweight car in standard production form. At that stage, reducing drag seemed like the only way to increase its speed. The curvaceous form of the 328, with its prominent front wings, may have been a masterstroke of engineering and design, but it was less than ideal aerodynamically. And so the BMW engineers set about designing a totally new body based on the latest knowledge from aerodynamics research. The Roadster was followed by a Touring Coupe and Kamm Coupe racing cars.\nThe BMW 328 continued to enjoy success in international competition into the 1950s. This makes it one of the most successful racing cars in BMW\u2019s long history in motorsport. Car races were far from a regular event in post-war Germany, but when they did happen, a handful of BMW 328 always featured prominently in the starting field. Many drivers carried out modifications to the aerodynamics and engine of their cars, and some even employed their own teams of mechanics. Indeed, independent drivers were now enriching the racing scene as designers, creating racing machines brimming with imagination and improvisation. Into the 1950s, more than 10 years after its introduction, the BMW 328 and its offspring from various body manufacturers were still dominating the 2-litre class.",

The dimensionless unit hydrographs were expressed as ratios of q/qq as a function of t/tp. These dimensionless unit hydrographs were compared with similar unit hydrographs derived from floods on Taiwan and with the unit hydrographs derived from a mathematical model developed from the two parameter gamma function developed from the theory of the instantaneous unit hydrograph. It was found that the unit hydrographs derived from the Thai watersheds had much longer base length and much longer time to peak than similar unit hydrographs derived from floods on Taiwan. This increase in length of response time is attributed to a larger component of subsurface runoff believed to be present in the floods from tropical watersheds.",

    "text": "Finding a high quality photographer for your family portrait, wedding or other special events can be daunting, to say the least. A professional photographer with local insider Lynn Haven knowledge can give you more than just an experienced person on the end of the camera, but someone who knows the best local places to shoot and can give your photos a more authentic local feel.\nOur portfolio of work is available upon request? So, depending on what kind of photographs you need, we can offer a great studio in Lynn Haven or we can photograph outdoors in or around the city if you prefer\u2026or both, if you prefer. The object is to capture and convey your unique appeal, no matter where we take the photographs. So please reach out to us and we\u2019d be more than happy to provide you with as much information as you need, as well as offering testimonials, so you can decide if we\u2019re the professional photographer service that you would like to carry out your photography work here in Lynn Haven. We look forward to speaking to you soon!\nWith our significantly growing technical world we live in it\u2019s becoming more regular that we come across people who are debating whether they need to employ a professional photographer. Why not simply take them yourself? Or better yet, have a good friend or family member with a good camera take the photos? Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy the fact many people have access to technology that can help them photograph their day to day lives; but, when it comes to important events, milestones, business headshots, personal shoots, and your wedding, it is important that you employ a professional! There is a lot more that goes into expert photography than having great equipment \u2026 So today, I am sharing with you the TOP SIX REASONS why you ought to think about employing an expert photographer.\n1) Consistent Results \u2013 In my opinion, I think 2 key components of an expert golfer are consistency and versatility. For example, an excellent golfer that plays the regional course twice a week every week, might have the ability to par the course regularly, but that golfer might not be that consistent when having to adapt to an entirely new course and especially a difficult course. but an expert golfer can not only shoot par and way much better in many cases regularly, but they can also adapt to a brand-new course. This is similar to the way an expert photographer works. An expert photographer can be consistent in various scenarios by adapting to the surrounds based upon knowledge. This consistency, adaptability and knowledge are all things that produce quality results from the professional photographer.\n2) Equipment \u2013 Some pros might not agree with me on this, but ask them exactly what they shoot with. You will likely discover that it\u2019s not the most recent low-end consumer DSLR. It\u2019s true that equipment alone does not magically make someone professional photographer. So just to clarify, if someone goes to the camera shop in the morning and spends thousands of dollars, that doesn\u2019t mean she or he is instantly professional. Nevertheless, for those genuinely doing photography as a career, there is typically a significant investment that comes with that career choice. One camera bag might have countless dollars worth of financial investment inside it. You wouldn\u2019t use a professional in other fields that don\u2019t have the right equipment to do the job, so don\u2019t use a photographer who bought a camera, a kit lens and a flash on Saturday and magically Monday morning they are a pro. In the BIG brand name photography world, it\u2019s most likely these photographers will not be going after that business. but small business owner beware, make certain the photographer is equipped to carry out the task and provide exceptional quality.\n3) It\u2019s Your Brand \u2013 Your brand is very important and professional photography is a simple way to make your brand name stand out. It\u2019s true that in the digital age that you or your friend armed with a good camera can get some shots that may be just sufficient for the Internet and look excellent. Nevertheless, with a little financial investment for a true professional photographer, your brand name might go from average to great. Perception is everything. Invest in professional photographer and not someone who just takes good pictures that may just be good enough.\n4) You Get What You Pay For \u2013 OK, you don\u2019t always get exactly what you pay for and in some cases high price is not as good as cheap. Nevertheless, when you are working with a real skilled professional photographer and are really comparing apples to apples, it\u2019s likely that the cheapest photographer out there will not deliver equivalent outcomes. Although the inexpensive photographer could be a philanthropist and be fantastic, it\u2019s likely that too cheap will just yield good outcomes and not excellent ones. A buddy of mine sent me some examples of a professional photographer\u2019s work just recently together with what the photographer desired for the images, I was surprised at the results and the price. Why did my buddy not go with me? He knows that I am not the cheapest option for his requirements and just uses me for his bigger budget jobs. FYI, I am not crazy high price. There are services that professional photographer will offer that are an excellent fit for small businesses.\n5) Professional Editing \u2013 In the consumer market, it\u2019s not unusual for a brand-new photographer to shoot a session and burn a huge number of images to a disc and they are done. A real professional cares more about their work and credibility than to just turn over a disc of the images. Real professional photographers edit their work even if it\u2019s just a fast run through of Adobe Lightroom. However, some images need large amounts of attention which could take a number of minutes to an hour plus just to appropriately modify one image. Ask if the photographer you are considering edits their work. This is one easy way for the photographer to save you some money and them time but likely provide good results vs. great.\n6) Because He or She Is Professional \u2013 A true professional photographer will act in professional manner in the way they do business. There is something to be said in any business about professionalism. A plumber may not be looked at like an attorney, but the plumber should still treat you with respect, as well as respecting your residence by not walking on your carpet in muddy shoes and provide services in a manner that leaves you feeling 100% satisfied! A professional photographer, especially in the world of business, ought to not only provide great photography services but make you feel happy by his/her mindset.\nOur lives on this earth are short-lived, but photographs are timeless! Leave a piece of you with those you love in still images. Give them something to remember you by, to keep, to value. I hope that after reading this you will think about hiring a professional photographer for all your photography needs. carry out some research! Find a photographer who\u2019s style you like, and take some time to connect with them. Finding and selecting the correct photographer will leave you with incredible memories and beautiful photographs to enjoy for a life time.\nLynn Haven is a city in Bay County, Florida, United States, north of Panama City.

    "text": "Perhaps you make a good point there bizaro. My past experience in following FFH's investments has made me gun shy of doing that. These guys are in a different game and this could be a sound idea.\n1) Lundin is a much larger company (by market cap) than Yamana. They have more financial resources to fund the $250 million expansion projects at Chapada (throughout increase and Sucupira pit pushback).\n2) Lundin is a copper-focused company. Chapada is primarily a copper mine with significant gold credits. Lundin spends a lot of money aggressively exploring for copper at its properties. The Yamana copper reserves and resource growth will likely ramp up under Lundin's exploration team.\nThis is more or less the entire argument, if you ask me. Just can take a LOOOOONG time to play out given how long cycles last and how long it takes to get a mine from idea to production.\nBHP makes a strategic investment in Midland, way above current market price. C$5.9 million raised at 1.70 a share.\nBHP gets right of first offer on Mythril. If the drilling hits BHP wants the project because it is potentially a very large copper deposit (based upon the IP surveys).\nLundin conference call emphasizes that they have no capital constraints compared to Yamana. They plan to bring copper production forward in an aggressive manner. I expect the gold-only Suruca deposit to be shelved, while Chapada expansion timeline will be accelerated. Yamana had been slowplaying the major expansion spending to try to keep a cash flow positive profile for a few years.\nI can imagine the conservatives putting political pressure on the utilities to delay the coal power plant conversions a few years to save thousands of coal mine or coal power plant related jobs. Phaseout is inevitable but the exact timing is still up in the air, especially for the Genesee plants.\nWolfden Resources cutting timber for forest management has been kicking out revenue to Altius. Altius gets 20% of the sales receipts from timber sales. Altius received C$92,232 in timber revenue in 2018, and has received C$66,299 so far in 2019. See Wolfden\u2019s most recent MD&A. I believe these sales receipts become part of Altius\u2019s project generation revenue.\nThese regular sales are separate from what will eventually be a total sale of the Mt. Pickett timber rights (for at least US$5 million).\nBecause the total sale of timber rights didn\u2019t happen by November 2018 Altius can now, at any time, demand the return of what it paid for the Mt. Pickett royalty, C$7.663 million, in cash or shares of Wolfden.\nWolfden was a speculative royalty deal but Altius built some excellent protections into the deal.\nStrong Q1 performance and raised guidance. Potash is performing very well.\nAltius should be in striking range for C$90 million total revenue in 2019 (royalty and project generation revenue). This preliminary Q1 royalty number doesn\u2019t include ~C$300K from Voisey\u2019s Bay and PG revenue (timber sales etc). LIF must keep paying out and Chapada should have a big second half of the year with the improved recovery circuits installed this quarter. Maybe a couple hundred thousand extra revenue from Excelsior in Q4.\n90 million would be quite a reach. I will stick with 80 million for the year. Lundin buying Chapada, UCP win, highest quarter royalty revenue record, raised guidance and Altius barely moves. I think CapitalCities comment about the market not caring sums it up nicely.",

    "text": "Between Pride of the Clouds and Thunderclap Wyvern, I'd try and go all-in on the flying theme! Favorable Winds , Warden of Evos Isle and Esper Stormblade would all be useful additions to that end.\nThe decklist looks cool, some suggestions. If you are going to run Delver of Secrets Flip you are gonna need a lot more spells and scrying so that it can be flipped more consistantly (Also run 4 of Delver, and 4 Pteramander. Cut out Mistcloaked Herald). That also works well with Pteramander so you can adapt it a bit easier. The one thing that you REALLY should run is Remand , it is a great tempo play, and you also draw another card. Spell Pierce is great. Serum Visions for the scrying. A great budget option for blue is Nimble Obstructionist , since it is a flying threat with flash AND can counter any activated or triggerd ability you do not control. Depending on your budget you really cannot go wrong with Snapcaster Mage , since you can reuse any spell. Vendilion Clique is great for tempo, another threat in the air and lets you take an important card from your opponents hand it is great against combo decks. I would take out Favorable Winds since it is a bit slow and Pteramander , Tempest Djinn and Delver of Secrets Flip are great finishers, seems a bit redundant. Not so sure about the Unstable Mutation but i do se the appeal of it. These are just some suggestions and it kinda depends on what direction you want to take it in, your budget and if you want it to be competative. Hope this helps in any way.\n-2 summary judgment +2 Favorable Winds +1 though for running W/U without a Tbag in it.\nGood start. To pump your fliers use Favorable Winds . I would replace Curiosity for Curious Obsession if your budget permits. And maybe Jace's Phantasm as a cheap solution for graveyard decks. Good luck!",

If you wanted true performance, you had to reach a little deeper into your pocket, and pull out a bit more of that hard earned money.\nWith Netgear being an industry leader in network storage solutions, it seems only fitting that they would offer top to bottom storage solutions for every sector of the market. Today, on this crisp winter morning, we will be looking over the Netgear ReadyNAS 104. The RN104 is a four bay NAS appliance that caters to the needs of consumers that want personal cloud storage. It offers standard features like a home media and file server, coupled together with low entry cost.\nThe RN104 is built upon the Marvell ARMADA 370 platform, clocked at 1.2 GHz, with 512MB of memory to accompany it. Across the front of the unit, we have four 3.5\" drive trays that support tool-less installation. Total storage capacity is listed at 16TB, with dual gigabit LAN ports at the rear of the unit.\nFor quick management of the NAS, we have a two line LCD screen on the front of the unit, with dual USB 3.0 ports, and eSATA for additional storage options. Power consumption is listed at 45 watts for operation, and 1.4 watts with WOL enabled.\nPricing of the four bay Netgear ReadyNAS 104 is listed at $319.99, without drives. The unit carries a three-year warranty from Netgear.",

But, other than the name, you\u2019d be hard pressed to connect the new SUV with the rough-and-ready truck from yesteryear.\nBlazer is five-passenger, two-row crossover that fits between the compact Equinox and three-row Traverse.\nIt is attractive \u2013 much better looking \u2013 than the original, and displays far superior road manners. Its smooth and quiet ride is a credit to unibody construction, instead of the old body-on-frame. It\u2019s also more fuel-efficient, thanks to stop/start technology, cylinder deactivation in the V6 and a smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic that always seems to know the right gear.\nIts frisky RS trim level is the hot rod of the family. It has the boldest look, with a blacked-out front end and black up-sized 21-inch wheels (from standard 18-inch). It looks especially good on a bright red body colour. Its engine growl is just loud enough to let you know the optional 3.6-litre V6 means business, cranking out a respectable 305 hp and 269 lb.-ft. of torque.\nThe Premier trim level is more dignified, with generous chrome treatment on the outside and quality accented leather interior treatment. Automatic heated steering wheel and heated/ventilated front seats tie in with the automatic climate control system. The windows can be opened remotely to let cabin heat out as you approach the car.\nAll models have HID headlamps mounted low and LED daytime running lights.\nCargo space is an impressive 1,818 litres with the rear seated folded. A rail-based system allows the space to be configured and blocked off as needed to secure items, and the rails store neatly in front of the spare tire when not needed.\nThere are some nifty touches to this vehicle \u2013 like a hands-free power liftgate with a light that shines a Chevy emblem on the ground to show you where to swing your foot. Inside, the rear seat slides forward to allow more cargo space and tilts back to allow extra headroom \u2013 unnecessary, since a six-footer can easily fit with the seat upright.\nChevrolet\u2019s updated Infotainment 3 system comes with 8.0-inch touchscreen, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. There are up to six USB ports \u2013 even the new USB type-C standard \u2013 wireless phone charging, and a subscription-based 4G LTE WiFi hot spot. Active noise cancelling is standard on all trim levels. The rearview camera \u201chitch view\u201d makes hooking up to a trailer a one-person job.\nChevy started with the platform found on the XT5 and Acadia models, but it moved the wheels 44 millimetres further out to gain a squatter, planted feel, said Larry Mihalko, Chevy\u2019s vehicle performance manager.\nThe sporty RS also has high rate suspension springs, heavy stabilizer bars, sport-turned dampers and oversized shock absorbers. Although a relatively tall vehicle, the clever engineers have made this SUV feel very sportscar-like.\nIts frisky RS trim level is the hot rod of the family. It has the boldest look, with a blacked-out front end and black up-sized 21-inch wheels (from standard 18-inch).\nThe active yaw control system inputs traction data 100 times per second and adjusts power to each wheel. In hard cornering, it sends up to 80 per cent of the power to the outside rear wheel to push the SUV in the right direction.\nDrivers can also switch to front-wheel drive to cut fuel consumption under highway conditions. Fuel economy ranges around 9 litres/100 km in combined city/highway driving. The stock 2.5-litre turbo-charged four-cylinder offers a marginal gain in fuel economy over the six, and delivers 193 hp and 188 lb.-ft. of torque.\nA trip to the hills east of San Diego, Calif., confirms that this is an able highway cruiser, but no off-road bruiser. It comes equipped with street tires and a low front end that would whither at the first sight of a rock.\nEven so, there\u2019s much to like in this revived Blazer. The entry-level basic model starts at just over C$30,000 in Canada, is well-equipped and offers good value. The highest trim levels, however, are more than C$50,000 \u2013 definitely pushing the limits of the category, which includes Mazda CX5, Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and Toyota Highlander.\nYou don\u2019t have to go high-end to get a fun ride with the Blazer. Whatever configuration you choose, it feels like a sturdy and stable vehicle designed for city and highway driving.\nThe Blazer is available for order across North America now.",

This port is one of the most ideal locations for provisioning, crew change, lubricants supplies, minor electronics repairs, etc., because it is on the crossroads of numerous international shipping lanes, including the Gibraltar Strait-Black Sea route, Adriatic Sea-Suez Canal or Black Sea route, and various other main sea lanes to/from the Adriatic Sea. The deviation required to reach Vatica Bay is can be as little as 3-5 nautical miles. The port offers safe anchorage (recommended anchorage position: 36\u00ba30'N /23\u00ba01'5''E) with good depths and no pilotage requirement for arrival or departure.",

    "text": "Unlike many of his peers, Crane is quick to let down his hair [not literally, of course].\nYou might know Ben Crane best from his YouTube videos, in which he speeds up his pace of play by donning Rollerblades and being towed by a golf cart; raps about barely qualifying for the FedEx Cup playoffs (\"I'm a bubble boy/buh-buh-bubble boy\"); and shares his mental-game secrets, Golf in the Kingdom\u2013style (\"I experience zone. I'm speaking to you from the now, in the middle of the now.\") Crane also croons with his fellow Golf Boys bandmates Rickie Fowler, Hunter Mahan and Bubba Watson (with lyrics by Mat Kearney, the singer-songwriter who, like Crane, hails from Oregon). But the 37-year-old funnyman also has an intense side. You've heard of the 10,000 hours it takes to master a pursuit? Crane has logged 35,000 hours honing his game. (He counted.) If you think that's odd, consider that Crane believes he's no more innately talented at golf than you are. The main reason he chose this career path was because as a kid he could beat his five buddies. The Tour's biggest ham talks about the 100 percent commitment required to excel at both golf and comedy, his infamously slow pace of play, and why he won't let the bad back that knocked him out of the 2013 FedEx Cup playoffs diminish his enthusiasm -- or his sense of humor.\nIn the media center after you won the 2010 Farmers Insurance Open, you broke into an impersonation of your southern-fried, former-college-football-coach agent Tommy Limbaugh. It got quite a laugh, even among the cynical press. Was that when you realized you could bring your act to a wider audience?\nIt's been a slow progression, no pun intended, where things have just worked. The more you show your personality, the more fun everyone else has. I'm watching tennis last night, I'm watching Rafael Nadal play a guy, and it was 6-0 in the first set, and in the second set the guy is just trying to score a point. He finally thought he scored one; they did the shot-spot thing, and it was out by an inch. It was the moment where he should have gone, like, What do I gotta do to score a point against this Nadal guy? But he didn't. Athletes get so stuck in competition sometimes that we just can't let go of it.\nHas your game improved since you've been expressing this lighter side?\nWell, 2010 and 2005 were my best years, but it's been a battle with my body. I have a lot more potential now, and I have a bigger team around me. Instead of no one following me, now I'll have friends who are following me, and sometimes they'll walk up to a random person and say, \"Who are you following?\" In a few cases the person has said, \"Ben Crane. He's my favorite player.\" And my friend will go, \"Why?\" And the kid will say, \"You don't know? You don't know about the videos?\" [Laughs] That is so fun right there.\nYour fans definitely get your sense of humor. When your caddie decided to take a day off on a Wednesday, and you told people to apply on Twitter for the one-day job to replace him, you got interesting responses, like, \"I have a rough tongue like a cat and can clean the grooves of a wedge in seconds. My tics are mostly silent.\"\n[Laughs] That deserves to be written somewhere in this magazine! That is so good. We've opened up the job twice, actually. We did it at the Byron Nelson and at the Travelers. For the Nelson, we found a guy who had played in college. It was his birthday. And for the Travelers, we did it for a cause called Charity: Water, and the guy bid a couple of thousand bucks. He was awesome. We really hit it off.\nDo you think most Tour pros could stand to loosen up?\nI don't think, I know. I mean, I'm very serious between the ropes at times, especially when it's not going well. I can feel like I can't let myself have a good time. But guys need to pick their chin up a little bit and look around. Dude, you're on the PGA Tour! You've probably dreamed about this since you were a kid. It's so fun. I don't care if you just made double; you have the opportunity to look at a kid and throw him a ball and make his day. I try to remember that.\nYou show full comedic commitment in your spoof videos, which you have to do to make them work. Your wardrobe gets laughs, too. Where did the helmet come from? In the video where you offer exercise tips, it's a crucial prop, along with the unitard.\nMy buddy went to Goodwill and found it. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" It's a low-end ski helmet. I never picked up on that until the fifth video. That whole outfit is like five bucks at Good-will. It's awful. It's so tight. It doesn't breathe. It would be great in the Oregon fall, for surfing.\nWho are your favorite comedians? Have you seen Borat?\nI have not seen Borat. Honestly, the stuff that Joel [Stock], my caddie, and I have seen -- he has a great sense of humor and a great memory for funny lines -- would be \"Coming to America,\" \"Spies Like Us,\" \"Caddyshack\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\"\nRight. Kind of like \"Life of Pi.\" At the end you go, \"Ah, now it makes sense.\"\nUnfortunately, \"Planes.\" It was a big letdown. \"Shrek\" was amazing. \"Cars\" was amazing. \"Planes\" was not. And \"Finding Nemo\" was great.\nYou have three kids, so it's obvious who's picking the movies. What TV shows do you watch?\nYou know, I'm trying to think if I've turned on the TV this year for something other than sports. I watched the Bible documentary. When you have three kids under 6, you have to ask, am I going to space out on the couch for an hour and a half, or am I going to hang out with my kids? When your kids are grown up and out of the house, everyone says, \"It happened so fast. I wish they were back.\"\nMusician Mat Kearney helped with the lyrics on Golf Boys 2.0 and the Bubble Boy video, which poked fun at you for being 125th on the money list at the Barclays. Which video took the longest to make?\nGolf Boys 2.0 was six weeks of talking to the production crew and doing some of the writing with Kearney, and giving feedback and stuff. The shoot only took two days, but afterward, editing and stuff, it was a couple of months. We shot it at Vaquero here in Dallas.\nDid everyone stay at your house?\nThey did, except for Hunter, who lives here. Bubba bought my daughter her first Elmo. He's awesome with kids. And Rickie was on the floor rolling around with them. It was funny; we were driving to the course and one of Kearney's songs came on the radio. I was sitting there thinking, What do you do when you're sitting right next to a guy whose song is on the radio? Do you sing along?\nDo you ever play money games with Ryan Palmer or Todd Hamilton or any of the other pros who live and play at Vaquero?\nI should, but it's really just practice. I like playing in the Phil money game, the Mickelson game on Tuesdays. It's competitive. I've played in that a few times, and you're so ready to play in the tournament after that.\nMickelson loves to get in guys' ears. Give us your best Phil smack-talking story.\nA few months back, Phil and I were playing a match in an off-week, and we were on the 10th green, both about eight feet away for birdie. He said, \"I found the secret to putting.\" And I said, \"Really?\" Well, I make my putt and he misses, and because he's always jabbing me, I say, \"Looks like I had the secret to putting on that one.\" He thinks about it for about 10 seconds and says, \"Yeah, but I had the secret to putting at the British Open.\" [Laughs] Yes, he did.\nYou rapped with Bubba Watson on the 16th tee during the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Were you more nervous for that or the golf?\nI was going to do it anyway. I had the helmet in the bag and everything. And then Bubba and I got paired together. I mean, are you kidding me? It was perfect. And there's a guy who stands up there and says, \"Hey, crowd, be quiet,\" and so we went over and grabbed his microphone. But, yeah, I was nervous.\nRory Sabbatini famously left you in the dust at the 2005 Booz Allen at Congressional. Have you gotten much faster with your pace of play since then?\nRory and I are friends, and I've tried to get better. Last year I talked to Jon Brendle, a Tour official, and they see everything. I said, \"Hey, how am I doing?\" His reaction was very positive. He said, \"Just keep up with the group in front of you.\" I don't want guys to get bummed out when they get paired with me. I didn't even know in high school and college golf that I was slow. No one ever said anything.\nYou beat Rory Mcllroy 8 and 7 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play in 2011, and later that year you made eight birdies in the last 11 holes to force a playoff with Webb Simpson in the McGladrey Classic, which you then won. Were you hotter when you thumped Rory or when you beat Webb?\nWhen I made those eight birdies, I got so hot with the putter. Webb told me he went back and watched the broadcast, like, six months later. He said, \"I got so mad. They were going in from across the green!\" With Rory, I was playing some of the best golf of my life, but my back went out the next morning on the range.\nYou finished the year 139th in driving distance. Was that because of your back?\nMy clubhead speed on the Nation-wide Tour was about 124 miles an hour. If I saw the front lip of a bunker 300 yards out, I wouldn't even think about it -- I'd just fly it. I was so long. I was No. 1 in driving distance for the first five months of the season out there, but then I got injured and stopped working on being fast, and now I'm way down in driving distance. [Laughs] I can't smoke it anymore.\nDid that inspire you to become a better short-game player?\nIt contributed to it. Plus, when you're not feeling well you can at least work on your chipping and putting, which I did. I would swing on a launch monitor and think about how I could get faster. I went from 115 mph to 124 mph in about a year.\nYou've worked with short-game coach James Sieckmann for a few years. How much of your short-game prowess do you owe to him? Why do you two click?\nI was having some trouble with my chipping and pitching, with my contact, especially on Bermuda grass with tight lies. I was like, \"I'm missing something.\" I spoke to Tom Pernice, who said, \"You should go see my guy.\" I said, \"You've got a guy?\" It's been dynamite. I think I'm top 10 in bunker play. He really understands the mental game, too.\nHave you also seen improvement in your wedge play?\nI'm much more confident with that 50-yard shot, the 60-yard shot, just because he's taught me proper technique and how to practice for that shot. The difference between the best player in the world and the guy who finishes 100th on the money list is not much -- maybe one shot a round.\nIt's a fine line out there. \"It's a fine line between clever and stupid.\" Do you know what that's from?\n\"This Is Spinal Tap.\" Have you seen that film?\nYou have to see \"Spinal Tap\"! For a comedy lover, it's an absolute must.\nOkay, it's on my list. I'll write it down.\nYou used to not look at the Tour pairings to see who you were playing with the next day, in case it was someone you grew up idolizing. Do you still not look?\nI still don't look. The Tour sends you your tee time for the next day, but it goes to my caddie's phone, it goes to my wife's phone, but not to my phone. Some guys will spoil the surprise and say, \"Looks like it's you and me tomorrow.\"\nYou learned the game at the age of 5 from your grandfather, right?\nYeah, my grandpa was like my best friend, and if I wanted to hang out with him we were going to play golf. The cool thing was, he had three old guys he played with, and one of his cronies died when I was 8 or 10, so I took his spot. We gambled a lot. We played a dime a hole, and double or nothing on 18, so it was big money. That was when I learned to love the game. That was at Portland Golf Club, which we live a block away from in the summer.\nAre you a member there?\nYeah, they gave me an honorary membership. They have a plaque saying that that's where I learned to play. There's a lot of history there. They had a Ryder Cup in . Hogan played there, and a lot of the greats, so they're like, \"Do you want us to put your plaque up?\" [Laughs] I'm like, \"No, no, in the ground is fine.\" So they put it in the ground next to the putting green.\nYou're a big tennis fan. What else did you play as a kid?\nI'd seen my dad going to work every day [he owned a small media-development firm] and I thought, That looks terrible. I've got to figure out professional sports. I played basketball until 10th grade, but I was vertically challenged and maybe the fourth-best player on my team. Soccer, I was the third-best guy on my team. Baseball, I'm kind of afraid of the ball. Golf, well, I was the best golfer of my five friends, so I decided to go for it. I quit everything else, practiced every day as hard as I could. The pro I worked with growing up used to say, \"I think if I worked a little harder I could've made it.\" I thought, I'll never say that.\nSo you got your 10,000 hours in.\nThirty-five thousand -- I added 'em up.\nSo you should be really good by now, given you've put in more than three times as much as the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell recommends in his book \"Outliers.\"\nI read \"Bounce\" [by Matthew Syed] and \"Talent is Overrated\" [by Geoff Colvin]. I think Bounce is the best one. He proved that guys like Mozart, Roger Federer -- it has nothing to do with genes; it's about putting in specific, intense hours of practice. Of course, you can't play post for the Houston Rockets if you're my size.\nSo you don't think you have any more innate ability at golf than a bogey golfer?\nNo. I think we all have unique gifts, but just about anyone can train to be just about anything.\nWell, that's both encouraging and discouraging. Four victories on Tour, two Web.com wins -- are you done? You're 37, and you've got a bad back. Is this it?\nNo. I'm planning to do the Steve Stricker thing. I'm planning to go to 47, and I'm planning to have the best decade of my career from 37 to 47. I am so confident that my best golf is in front of me -- and this is the shooter's mentality in basketball -- that I'm thinking of putting money down on myself in Vegas.",

    "text": "Which got me thinking about other things that have been forced down our throats by the zeitgeist, people, places, and trends that the pop culture puppeteers insist on making relevant. Here are ten items I could truly do without. If you know me, I'm not usually about spreading the hateration, but sometimes we all need a good vent.\n1. Julianne Hough - Thankfully I never saw that Footloose remake. However, I did catch this summer's Rock of Ages, and while I was entertained, this 24-year-old bobblehead came close to spoiling the whole musical enchilada for me. And she's still dating Seacrest? And getting more movie roles? Why, Hollywood, why?\n2. Fifty Shades of Grey - I picked up a copy at the L.A. Times Festival of Books back in April, read one page, and then felt the urge to bring it with me into a bathroom stall after eating a dozen shrimp tacos. The latest literary sensation will eventually become the next movie franchise sensation. Wake me up when it's over.\n3. Ke$ha - The second full-length album from this glitter tramp is scheduled to arrive before the year is over. In related news, I think I just contracted herpes from writing that last sentence.\n4. Adam Sandler - I did not need to see Jack & Jill or That's My Boy to realize that the King of Fart Jokes (and his entire production company) is running on fumes. It would be great if he went into hiding and then returned 20 years later to do a respectable cameo in a Tarantino flick.\n5. Big-budget comic book adaptations - The Avengers should have been the grand finale that hammered the final nail in the genre's coffin. It was one giant, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am way to lasso up all of our favorite superheroes and send them off in a spectacular farewell. But no, we're getting Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Ant-Man, Iron Man 3, and another Wolverine.\n6. Charlie Sheen - This gimmick is deader than the silent graveyard otherwise known as my love life.\n7. Anything labeled with the Kardashian name - Speaks for itself.\n8. American Idol - Usually, when people are jumping overboard, that means the ship is sinking. This voyage plummeted to the bottom of the ocean a while ago and is now a piece of driftwood floating aimlessly in a pool of muck. How many more interchangeable \"white guys with guitars\" do we need to crown before every light on the stage burns out? Mariah Carey, prepare that life vest.\n9. Movies based on the novels of Nicholas Sparks - Or, what I like to call The Notebook Effect. Forever fooling singletons into thinking they'll meet the love of their life during a war, in a car accident, on a beach, or in a torrential rainstorm. I think I liked these better when they were called Lifetime Movies of the Week.\n10. Kristen Stewart - I'm sure she's a cool chick once you get to know her, but 1.) she ain't fairer than Charlize Theron 2.) I worry that future generations of impressionable actresses will be studying her two methods of \"acting\" which are: Look Like You're Constipated and Look Like You Got Cramps and 3.) the girl needs to enroll in a few classes on public speaking.\nI'll stop there. And to those responsible for the above, I hope you will too.\nAmen to #10. Frankly they're all right on the $$$. With all the forcefeeding happening all the time, this list could easily go on a bit further ~ maybe there will be a sequel?\nI COMPLETELY agree with them all (esp Kristen Stewart, as there are already actresses mimicking her and getting big roles!), except the comic book movies. I can't help it, I love them!",

Ilhan Omar (D-MN-05) fired off dozens of tweets this week in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s Tuesday address to the nation, nearly outpacing the president himself in tweets about the southern border wall.\n\u201cTwo children died in ICE custody last month after 10+ years with no such deaths. There\u2019s blood on your hands,\u201d Omar tweeted Tuesday.\nTonight, while #Trump gets free airtime for propaganda on the \"humanitarian & national security crisis\" at the border, CHILDREN sit in cold cages in inhumane conditions. Two children died in ICE custody last month after 10+ years with no such deaths. There's blood on your hands.\n\u201cWe are literally watching a manufactured crisis, designed to divert attention from this criminal and dysfunctional administration. Stay woke America, Individual-1 is not one to sleep on,\u201d she later wrote. Notably, Individual 1 was a code-name used by federal prosecutors in the charges brought against Trump\u2019s former attorney, Michael Cohen, and it was later made clear that Trump and Individual 1 are one and the same.\nWe are literally watching a manufactured crisis, designed to divert attention from this criminal and dysfunctional administration.\nAfter Trump\u2019s remarks, Omar sought to fact-check the president, specifically taking issue with his numbers on unaccompanied minors who crossed the border and were suspected of having MS-13 affiliations.\n\u201cBorder apprehensions are at a 45 year low, down 75 percent from 1.6 million in 2000 to 396,579 in 2018. The facts don\u2019t lie, but Trump does. Not one dollar for his vanity wall,\u201d Omar added.\nThe facts don't lie, but Trump does.\n\u201cThe number one role a president has is to protect Americans and our homeland, and today\u2019s visit to the southern border by President Trump further illustrates his strong commitment to the safety of this great nation and its people,\u201d Minnesota GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan said in a Thursday press release.\nBackground Photo \u201cTrump Shutdown\u201d by Ilhan Omar.",

    "text": "The design is part of the complex set of upgrading and territorial innovation actions promoted at the Universal Exposition 2015, aimed at enhancing the Lombard territory as a whole and, in particular, at ensuring the necessary access roads.\nThe design pursues full integration of the exhibition center Expo 2015 with the territory, ensuring proper access to the site by means of an expressway with approx. 3 km length, located northwest of Milan, close to the new Exhibition Center in Rho-Pero.\nFrom a merely road perspective, the link is a natural continuation of the alternative route to the S.S. 11 'Padana Superiore' in the municipality of Milan, as it originates from the intersection of the latter with the S.S. 33 'del Sempione'.\nDuring the upgrading stage, the route initially develops in an artificial tunnel passing under the area of the Integrated Intervention Plan in Cascina Merlata; then it joins the design roads for the new junction on the A4 Milan-Turin as well as with a primary municipal road under development in the municipality of Milan (interdistrict road). Subsequently, passing over the FS railway station Milano Certosa of the Milan-Novara line, the A4 motorway and the EXPO 2015 area, it ends with a partial junction on the A8 'Milano Laghi' motorway in north direction.\nThe layout has been designed in such a way that, in the future, an extension would be possible to reach the S.S. 233 'Varesina' and the SP 40 'Rho-Monza'.\nThe main works included in the design are the artificial tunnel passing under the area of the Integrated Intervention Plan in Cascina Merlata and the viaduct originating south of the intersected railway line and ending at the A8 motorway.\nBuilt with the characteristic excavation method 'Milan type' (which allows to minimize construction times and impact on the territory during the works) and the innovative system of the 'white tank' (thanks to which waterproof concrete can be obtained already during processing), the artificial tunnel develops for approx. 1 km, bypassing the S.S.33 del Sempione and joining the roads leading to the Western by-pass road at Molino Dorino.\nThe system of bridges and viaducts is made of a series of steel arches: for the bridges on the A4 and A8 motorways, these elements have a structural function; while along the EXPO viaduct they only have an aesthetic function, aimed at making the whole project look organic and well fitted into the urban context of 'EXPO 2015' and creating the so-called 'Door of Milan' (a distinctive element for those who drive on the road from and to the city center).\nThe whole elevated system is made even more homogeneous and characteristic by the covering 'guard' of the decks, an external metal coating of Alucobond that ensures continuity among the works. Thanks to specific lighting studies, the presence of this element helps create an appealing play of light during the evening and in the night.",

    "text": "The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is delaying the effective date of the final regulations that require nutrition labelling of the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products and ground or chopped meat and poultry products.\nThe original effective date for these regulations was January 1, 2012, but the new effective date of the final rule is March 1, 2012.\nFSIS is taking this action in response to a request from eight trade associations, including AMI. The associations requested that FSIS exercise enforcement discretion for a six month period following the January 1, 2012, effective date of the final rule. FSIS, however, concluded that a two month delay in the effective date will allow industry sufficient time to comply with the requirements of the final rule. FSIS is also making a correction to the final rule to clarify an amendatory instruction.",

    "text": "Alan Beattie reported on Friday at the Financial Times Online that, \u201cBrazil said on Thursday that it would suspend sanctions on US imports in retaliation for illegal American cotton subsidies, temporarily defusing one of the most contentious disputes in international trade.\n\u201cThe deal will extend until 2012 a holding arrangement in which the US pays Brazilian farmers $147.3m a year and promises to cut subsidies in future. In return, Brazil will hold off imposing blocks on imports or ignoring patents and copyrights, which it is entitled to do after a World Trade Organisation panel declared the US cotton support programme illegal.\nDTN Political Correspondent Jerry Hagstrom reported on Friday (link requires subscription) that, \u201cAs USDA officials and crop insurance executives prepared to meet in Kansas City Friday to discuss USDA\u2019s final offer of a new crop insurance contract, Agriculture Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Jim Miller and Rep. Jerry Moran sparred Thursday over whether CBO will credit the farm bill baseline with $2 billion the Obama administration intends to repurpose from crop insurance to other programs.\n(FarmPolicy.com Note: At an April 21 House Ag Committee hearing, Sec. Vilsack indicated in a response to a question regarding crop insurance and the baseline that, \u201cAs it relates to the baseline, just simply let me say that our hope is that we can work with the chairman and others on this committee and conserve and preserve these savings so that you all have the flexibility to do what you need to do as you begin to address the 2012 Farm Bill and Rural Development Bill with as much flexibility as you possibly need.\u201d (Unofficial Farmpolicy.com transcript, at page 27)).\nWilliam Neuman reported on Friday at The New York Times Online that, \u201cThe Obama administration proposed new rules on Friday seeking to increase competition and rein in potentially unfair practices by large meatpackers and poultry processors. The move is aimed at helping small livestock and poultry farmers survive in an industry dominated by corporate giants.\n\u201cThe rules could give farmers and ranchers new leverage in suing meat companies that they believe have treated them unfairly. They would end practices among cattle and hog buyers that may lower prices paid to farmers and feedlot owners. And they would set new protections for poultry farmers, who often must go deeply into debt to build the chicken houses needed to win contracts from processors.\nThe Times article noted that, \u201cThe regulatory move comes as the Agriculture and Justice Departments have been holding a series of public workshops to discuss allegations of anticompetitive behavior in agriculture.\nFriday\u2019s article added that, \u201cGroups representing the meat industry criticized the proposed rules.\nThe AP reported on Friday that, \u201cPerhaps the most significant provision in the new rules is one that makes it easier for farmers to file suits under the Packers and Stockyards Act, said Peter Carstensen, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who has studied agriculture competition law for decades.\n\u201cFarmers who now sue under the act must show a company has not only harmed them but that it has hurt competition in the overall meat industry, Carstensen said.\nBob Keefe reported on Friday at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that, \u201cThe rules could have a significant impact on farmers in Georgia \u2014 the nation\u2019s biggest poultry producer \u2014 and potentially affect how much consumers pay for chicken in the future.\nThe AJC article noted too that, \u201cThe proposed rule changes also raised a red flag at the Senate Agriculture Committee, where Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia is the ranking member.\nReuters news reported on Friday that, \u201cSmall-farm groups applauded the proposed rule. \u2018As long as the companies can arbitrarily cut off deliveries of birds to contract growers or cancel growers\u2019 contracts at any time, we will always be at the mercy of the companies\u2019 whims,\u2019 said Mike Weaver, president of the Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginias.\nIn other livestock related Farm Bill issues, Lyndsey Layton reported in yesterday\u2019s Washington Post that, \u201cUnder the Obama administration and the 2008 farm bill passed by Congress, the USDA is shifting attention to small and mid-size farms, encouraging organic and sustainable agriculture, and investing in projects to bring locally grown meat and produce to consumers.\n\u201cThe agency is promoting small meat producers in part by funding and approving more mobile slaughter units, staffing each one with a federal inspector, educating farmers and USDA employees about the units, and setting clear guidelines for farmers who want to build one. In December, the department set up a toll-free help line dedicated to small producers.\nAlexandra Zavis reported on Saturday at the Los Angeles Times Online that, \u201cWith concern growing in Sacramento about the millions of Californians struggling to get sufficient nutrition, advocates for the poor had hoped for progress this year on recommendations to improve access to federal food stamps.\nTom Zeller Jr. reported on Friday at The New York Times Online that, \u201c[P]ower generated by burning wood, plants and other organic material, which makes up 50 percent of all renewable energy produced in the United States, according to federal statistics, is facing increased scrutiny and opposition.\n\u201cThat, critics say, is because it is not as climate-friendly as once thought, and the pollution it causes in the short run may outweigh its long-term benefits.\nMr. Zeller noted that, \u201cBiomass proponents say it is a simple and proved renewable technology based on natural cycles. They acknowledge that burning wood and other organic matter releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just as coal does, but point out that trees and plants also absorb the gas. If done carefully, and without overharvesting, they say, the damage to the climate can be offset.\n\u201cBut opponents say achieving that sort of balance is almost impossible, and carbon-absorbing forests will ultimately be destroyed to feed a voracious biomass industry fueled inappropriately by clean-energy subsidies. They also argue that, like any incinerating operation, biomass plants generate all sorts of other pollution, including particulate matter. State and federal regulators are now puzzling over these arguments.\nErik Eckolm reported on Friday at The New York Times Online that, \u201cThe Obama administration has opened a broad campaign of enforcement against farmers who employ children and underpay workers, hiring hundreds of investigators and raising fines for labor and wage violators.\n\u201cBut to make deep inroads, Congress would first have to change the law. A proposal to ban the hiring of 12- and 13-year-olds, cap working hours by 14- and 15-year-olds and keep teenagers out of hazardous jobs is gaining support in Congress. Some 91 representatives have co-sponsored the Care Act, put forth by Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California.\nAnd Robert Rodriguez reported on Saturday at the Fresno Bee Online that, \u201cOvertime pay after eight hours is the law for wage earners across California \u2014 except for those who do some of the hardest work, harvesting fruit and vegetables in the state\u2019s fields and orchards.\n\u201cNow Sen. Dean Florez, D-Shafter, is trying to change that.\nJonathan Weisman reported on Friday at the Washington Wire Blog (The Wall Street Journal) that, \u201cPresident Barack Obama\u2019s meeting next Wednesday with senators to get energy legislation back on track will likely include discussing a climate change component that caps carbon emissions only from electric utilities, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said today in an interview.\nMr. Weisman added that, \u201cSen. Lamar Alexander (R, Tenn.), who has expressed some support for controlling utility carbon emissions, coupled with expanded nuclear power, is also expected to attend, along with Sens. Kerry, Lieberman, Jeff Bingaman (D, N.M.) and Richard Lugar (R, Ind.).\n\u201c\u2018The president\u2019s view is for inviting a wide range of people who have ideas.\u2019 Emanuel said.\nBen Geman reported yesterday at The Hill\u2019s Energy Blog that, \u201cSen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) said Sunday that he sees 20 swing votes in play for including greenhouse gas limits in energy legislation that the White House and Senate Democratic leaders hope to advance this summer.\n\u201cLieberman, appearing on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union,\u2019 [transcript] said there are 50 senators that want to put a price on emitting carbon, 30 against it and 20 members who are undecided.\n\u201cMurkowski instead touted bipartisan energy legislation that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a year ago. It contains a suite of provisions to boost energy efficiency and alternative energy development but lacks carbon provisions,\u201d The Hill update said.\nThe New York Times editorial board noted in today\u2019s paper that, \u201cTo anyone watching the oil spew into the Gulf of Mexico, the argument for curbing this country\u2019s appetite for fossil fuels could not be clearer. President Obama was right last week when he called on America to unify behind a \u2018national mission\u2019 to find alternative energy sources, sharply reduce its dependence on oil and cut its greenhouse gas emissions.\nScott Kilman repoted in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal that, \u201cTwo years after the global food crisis peaked, grain shortages are turning into surpluses that could create their own problems.\n\u201cSome traders and economists are speculating that if the U.S. and world economies don\u2019t heat up soon, surpluses could turn into price-depressing gluts. While cheap grain is good news for consumers and livestock producers, excessive supplies increase a government\u2019s cost for farm subsidies and tend to ignite trade fights between the big farming powers.\nThe Journal article stated that, \u201cWith world grain production this year expected to exceed demand for a third consecutive year, many grain traders and farm economists are beginning to debate the prospects for two starkly different outlooks.",

    "text": "Glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB) is a technique useful in patients with a reduced vital capacity owing to respiratory muscle paralysis, for example following poliomyelitis or in tetraplegic. It is a trick movement that was first described by Dail (1951) when patients with poliomyelitis were observed to be gulping air into their lungs. It was this gulping action that gave the technique the name 'frog breathing'.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient's voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation. The most common use of GPB is in patients who are able to breathe spontaneously but whose power to cough and clear secretions is inadequate. The technique may enable these patients to shout to attract attention and it may help to maintain or improve lung and chest wall compliance (Dail et al 1955).\nTo breathe in, a series of pumping strokes is produced by action of the lips, tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx. Air is held in the chest by the larynx which acts as a valve as the mouth is opened for the next gulp. Before starting to teach a patient glossopharyngeal breathing it is helpful for him to inflate his chest using an intermittent positive pressure ventilator with a mouthpiece. He can practice holding the breath while removing the mouthpiece and avoiding escape of air through the larynx or nose. The most important step in learning GPB is the up and down movement of the cricoid cartilage while keeping the jaw still. The patient can practice by watching the movement in a mirror and feeling the cartilage with his fingers.\nThis sequence should be practised slowly at first and then gradually speeded up until the movement flows. A leak of air may occur through the nose and, until it is prevented by the soft palate, a nose dip may be required.\nThe next stage is to take a maximum breath in and, while holding this breath, to add several glossopharyngeal gulps, to augment the vital capacity. When correct, the patient will feel his chest filling with air, and the physiotherapist can test the 'GPB vital capacity' by putting a mouthpiece attached to the expiratory limb of a Wright's respirometer in the patient's mouth before he exhales.\nThe respirometer can be used to measure the volume per gulp; the patient will require less effort and reach his maximum capacity more quickly if he develops a bigger volume per gulp. A study by Kelleher & Parida (1957) reported a group of patients in whom the average volume per gulp varied from 25-120 ml, and when teaching GPB an attempt should be made to achieve at least 60 ml per gulp. When used for clearance of secretions, 10-20 gulps may be required to obtain a maximal vital capacity, but if GPB is being used continuously as a substitute for normal tidal breathing approximately 6-8 gulps may be taken before breathing out.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing would normally be taught with the patient in a comfortable sitting position, but when mastered should be practiced in positions useful for the patient to clear his bronchial secretions. After filling his chest to capacity he signals to the physiotherapist who compresses his chest as he lets the air out The patient may have sufficient muscle power to apply compression himself or carers can be taught to give assistance.\nGPB is learnt easily by some patients, but others need time and patience to acquire this skill and must be motivated to practise frequently during the learning period. It is a valuable technique to consider when treating tetraplegic or poliomyelitis patients with a vital capacity of less man 2 litres. Instruction can begin when the patient has reached a stable condition, but it is inappropriate in the acute phase or during an acute chest infection. When successfully learnt it is invaluable during a period of chest infection to assist in the clearance of secretions. For a patient with a chest infection nursed in a 'tank' ventilator ('iron lung'), assisted coughing (Higgens 1966) may be more effective if the patient uses GPB to augment the inspiratory volume received from the ventilator before chest compression is applied.\nIt is possible to teach Glossopharyngeal breathing to patients with an uncuffed tracheostomy tube, provided there is an effective seal round the tube to avoid air leaks.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing should not be attempted in patients with neuromuscular disorders affecting swallowing, and, in patients with a progressive disorder, intermittent positive pressure breathing ( I P P B ) may be more appropriate than GPB. The technique is contraindicated in patients with airflow obstruction or pulmonary disease.\nFran\u00e7ois Maltais \"Glossopharyngeal-Breathing\", American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Vol. 184, No. 3 (2011), pp. 381.\nAssociation of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care.

    "text": "Happy Halloween: Smiley\u2019s Dog Costumes!\nOur first event came up unexpectedly, the Bridge and Tunnel Brewery was just a five minute walk from our apartment but we had no costume! I quickly cut out an avocado out of Dollar Tree cardboard paper and it was a success! Smiley won some toys and we got a growler for our fun last-minute costume.\nYou may have noticed the dog pictures on my Instagram, or read the two posts I wrote about our rescue Smiley \u2013 you may have even read the viral Dodo article about his rescue story! Our unexpected adoption (it only took two weeks of fostering to realize that Smiley belonged with us forever) changed all our plans. All those crazy Halloween parties we wanted to go to turned into us going to dog-friendly pub events, the dog parade and tonight we\u2019ll be going to the big NYC Halloween Parade with Smiley in tow.\nWe ended up going to another last minute event, the Tompkins Square dog parade, so Smiley wore his same avocadog costume and got outshined by popes and other crazy intricate creative costumes! It was a lot of fun and we\u2019re definitely going again next year with a better costume. Although most dogs wore hot dogs, delivery costumes and they rocked them, as a crafter I got inspired to do something a little more creative!\nTonight, the parade is mainly for people but Smiley will hopefully steal the show \u2013 as long as he actually wears the costume I made him and it doesn\u2019t fall apart. Stay tuned for photos of tonights shenanigans.\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 31, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags Avocadog, Halloween, Halloween parade, Halloween party, New York, Smiley, TompkinsLeave a comment on Happy Halloween: Smiley\u2019s Dog Costumes!\nTwo days ago we sent a $300 adoption fee to Pound Hounds Res-Q, the place that pulled Smiley from Brooklyn\u2019s high kill shelter, NYACC. We had originally planned on fostering Smiley, the cute 6 year old pit mix who was abandoned because his former owners got pregnant. We were in no position to get a dog \u2013 we don\u2019t make enough money and live in a small apartment, but we couldn\u2019t let Smiley die.\nWe ended up adopting Smiley after just two weeks of fostering, mostly because we fell in love with our foster boy and also because of Pound Hounds Res-Q. In addition to the fee, we also gave a small donation because of everything the rescue has done for us. Donating to rescues helps them save more dogs so I encourage everyone to do the same!\nThe amazing thing about fostering, is that it\u2019s practically free and saves lives! Shelters such as the NYACC become overcrowded and put animals on the kill list very quickly. They barely get a chance to get adopted! If you foster a dog, a rescue will cover the vet bills and any necessary training. Then you help the dog get decompressed, preferably crate trained and then you help them find a new forever home.\nFostering is a great way to help animals without making a lifetime commitment, that many people can\u2019t do. If we hadn\u2019t ended up adopting Smiley, we would have likely kept fostering, because it has been so rewarding. Let me tell you a bit about it!\nSmiley went from the NYACC to the vet to get neutered, then a special service was hired to bring him to us. We had never met him or even see him in real life! Smiley was friendly and curious but he wouldn\u2019t look up at me or make eye contact. He also didn\u2019t respond to commands, although we were told that he knew to sit, stay and come.\nWhen I brought him inside, he explored the place, sniffing every corner and demanding to know what was behind every door. It took over an hour to get him to slow down and rest on his doggy bed. He lay there for a while until I tried to put his harness on for a walk. He wouldn\u2019t let me put it on I\u2019m and bared his teeth, so I backed off and let him sleep. A few hours later, after my husband came home, he let us put the harness on without any fuss.\nOn his first walk with us, he pulled like crazy, giving us rope burn. He was so strong and wouldn\u2019t listen at all outside. We immediately ordered a front pulling harness, but got dragged around painfully for three whole days. We also watched some videos on how to get a dogs attention on walks and we tried to implement them, which only half worked.\nThe first evening while we watched TV, we saw him watching us from his bed. It was the first time he looked at us. Not surprising after being handed off from one person to another for ten days. He was scared and confused.\nWe crated him that first night as instructed by the rescue. People want to adopt crate trained dogs and we had to try our best although we didn\u2019t like the idea of him being in a small cage. He barked a bit but quickly went to sleep. The next morning he woke up wagging his tail at us, it was progress!\nThe second day he acted like a spoiled child, pushing his boundaries. He would jump on the sofa, demand treats and he pulled me even harder outside. I may have had one or two breakdowns that day because I couldn\u2019t connect with him. I couldn\u2019t see anyone adopting a dog that was this crazy and I also didn\u2019t know how long I could spend with him, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him like humans have in the past.\nThat night he barked more in his crate at night, and I was stressed knowing that we would have to leave him alone for up to six hours the next day. Everyone reassured me that he would be okay, as long as he wore a cone \u2013 he was recently neutered and could rip his stitches.\nWhen we came home after our trip, that we couldn\u2019t cancel although we had wanted to, we found his cone out of shape and he was practically hanging by it because a piece got stuck in his crate. It was around his neck so tight that he coughed when I cut it off. He seemed fine otherwise and extra friendly, but I was traumatized by the experience. I was too scared of putting him back in the crate while he had his cone, so we let him sleep in our bedroom on his bed.\nWhen he woke up that Sunday (we had gotten him in the afternoon on Thursday) he was a completely different dog. He was so calm at home, looked at us, asked us for pats and actually listened when we gave him commands. That day we took him to a beer festival because we didn\u2019t want to leave him home alone.\nWe had been told that he shouldn\u2019t be around other dogs or kids so we were extra careful. But he was calm around kids, accepting treats gently and he wagged his tail when he saw other dogs. We let him sniff a few and it seemed fine, we were starting to doubt everything that the kill shelter had said about him. We found a quiet spot at the chaotic festival and he sat with us, observing. People came over to meet him and he was so friendly and loving to everyone. No one believed that we had just rescued him.\nThe next day we had received a front clipping harness and the moment we put it on him, he stopped pulling on walks. He still got distracted outside but he was so much better at walking calmly. We let him sniff more dogs and discovered that he was super friendly but couldn\u2019t tell between dogs that wanted to play or fight.\nThe following week he started to feel at home. We let him sit with us on the couch but still kept him out of bed. He behaved better every day. Except the one time he jumped on the bed when I screamed because I saw a spider \u2013 but that\u2019s because I screamed and I assume that he was trying to protect me.\nDuring the week we also let him play with some dogs while leashed. He seemed to get along with everyone, ignoring the dogs who were aggressive and he backed away when an angry cat jumped out at him. He was clearly a good gentle boy!\nThat second weekend we had him, we took him to an amazing day care Petbuddy Services for a trial day. We were nervous to see how he would get a long with other dogs but it went really well! After a day of playing with dogs, he was even calmer on walks and less jumpy when he met new dogs.\nThe day he spent at doggy daycare we went out, but came home before picking Smiley up. Our home felt so empty without him even though he had only been there for ten days! That\u2019s when we decided that we\u2019d be keeping him. But we wanted to wait in case there were any issues with our landlord, although those were unlikely.\nOn Wednesday we took him to the vet again, and even though the rescue knew we were 99% likely to adopt him, Pound Hounds Res-Q paid his bill. Later that evening, we officially paid his adoption fee and he became a part of our family. The next day, I let him play off leash with a bunch of friendly dogs at the park and he did so well, people didn\u2019t believe me that he was a new rescue.\nSince getting Smiley there has been more stress in my life \u2013 we need to figure out where he will be while we\u2019re on holiday. We need to worry about him getting sick, hurting himself or feeling lonely when he\u2019s alone at home. I also have a companion at home now, a smiling face that makes me happier and I can\u2019t walk him down the street without him getting compliments left and right. Oh, he also gets me out of the house more and breathing that fresh New York air! I\u2019ve even met a few local dog owners that are quickly becoming friends.\nOf course I\u2019m already worrying about Smiley dying one day, but that\u2019s just how my brain works. He has already made my life so much better and more worthwhile. As much as I think that everyone should adopt a dog, or five, immediately, I understand that not everyone is int he position to do so.\nFoster! If you can\u2019t adopt. Donate to rescues, if you want to help but can\u2019t foster. Dogs, and animals in general, bring so much happiness and unconditional love to our hectic lives. They deserve our help and love, they should all feel safe and happy \u2013 the same way they make us feel. Please consider donating to Pound Hounds Res-Q today, without them we wouldn\u2019t have this beautiful dog as a part of our family!\nWe\u2019ve been to Tonsai twice now \u2013 once in December and the second time in July. December was hot, dry, lively and exciting! In July it was dead, everything was closed, the weather was miserable! Tonsai is a great place that\u2019s still pretty empty compared to Phi Phi Island and even neighboring beaches.\nWhile it\u2019s the perfect getaway during high (and dry) season, it\u2019s really not enjoyable during the low (monsoon) season. Unless you enjoy being one of 10 tourists on a hard to get to spot with only two available restaurants that mainly serve fried food. If you come any other time, you can enjoy a long tail boat ride to the beach, a choice of many restaurants, food vendors and bars, there are lots of people hanging out on the beach or at the hostels but there are also thieving mischievous monkeys!\nWe\u2019re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\nSmiley was pulled from the NYACC by Pound Hounds Res-Q. We are considering adopting him ourselves because he\u2019s such a good boy. The Dodo wrote about him a week ago with the hopes that his story will inspire others to adopt, foster and rescue dogs in need!\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 23, 2018 October 22, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags dog saved, foster, fostering, kill shelter, Pound Hounds, Pound Hounds Resq, rescue, rescue dog, SmileyLeave a comment on We\u2019re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\nThe second time we visited Thailand was the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away \u2013 but clearly not all of them.\nThe first time we visited Thailand was during the dry winter months when it\u2019s hot, overpopulated with tourists and low tied can ruin boat rides, kayaking and other water adventures. The second time we came in the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away \u2013 but clearly not all of them.\nA week before we arrived the famous case of football camp boys who were stuck in a flooded cave and a ferry had sunk, drowning many on board. We didn\u2019t know about this when we booked and it was quite scary to be there. We got lucky and the weather ended up clearing up, but all ferry and boat rides were rough, scary and puke-inducing.\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\nIt\u2019s prime mushroom picking season but it\u2019s quickly cooling down. You might be seeing mushrooms all around you, even in city parks and on the side of highways! There\u2019s still some time to go out and forage before winter chases us indoors for Netflix, hot chocolate and hibernation. However, most mushrooms take a lot of experience to identify which can be scary and discouraging.\nIt is also extremely dangerous to eat anything that you\u2019re not certain about. Although there are many YouTube videos and Facebook groups are not always a reliable way to be sure that you will be safe. Even after you read this article, go talk to experienced mushroom pickers, join a mycological society and always be overly careful.\nIt is not legal to pick mushrooms everywhere. Ask a police officer, park ranger or at the info center where you can pick them. If you go anywhere else, you risk getting a hefty fine. In NYC it can be up to $250!\nWild mushrooms are not like the ones you buy at the store. Some people might experience an allergy to a specific type even though they are not allergic to others. Some edible mushrooms have skins that certain people might react to with a stomach ache. Although I am lucky to be allergy free and tolerate everything I\u2019ve tried so far, I\u2019m aware that I might eat a perfectly good edible mushroom that might make me feel sick.\nLet\u2019s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The giant puffball (tiny ones are good too) is really easy to identify, grows to be huge so it\u2019s satisfying to find and it\u2019s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\nPuffballs come in round shapes and in various sizes. They don\u2019t have any gills, or stems, they grow right out of the ground. The regular kind is small, round, white/grayish/yellowish with tiny bumps and they get dark and dry when they are ready to release their spores. When they are dry, you can stomp on them and they will puff out dark-colored spores, which is why they are called puffballs.\nGiant puffballs don\u2019t taste any better than small ones, arguably they taste worse. But one big puffball can feed a family of three for a day. They can grow to be larger than your head! In their prime they are pure white on the outside and inside.\nIf they are any there color, or have any markings, be cautious.\nUnlike the hen-of-the-woods that I wrote about earlier this week, giant puffballs do have a very poisonous lookalike, but it\u2019s extremely easy to differentiate them! Once you pick a puffball, cut it down the middle from top to bottom, an edible puffball will have firm purely white firm flesh without any markings. It should look like sliced mozzarella!\nIf the mushroom is off-white, it\u2019s an edible kind that\u2019s past it\u2019s prime. Don\u2019t eat it! There are several stages of a puffball going bad. First, the inside will get yellower but will remain firm. Then it\u2019ll get wetter and darker, at this point the outside might be getting yellower too. Finally, it dries up and releases dark gray/black spores.\nEven when a puffball is yellow, it\u2019s technically not poisonous. The only type of puffball that is poisonous, is one with black lines that look like intricate designs. These will be on the outside and on the inside. These puffballs are very poisonous and should NOT be consumed.\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! Just make sure to cut every single mushroom in half, and throw any puffball that isn\u2019t pure white on the inside. The rule of thumb with mushrooms is, if there is any doubts, leave it behind.\nIf you thought that the hen-of-the-woods had many recipes, just wait until you bring home a haul of puffballs. You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\nAll you need to do is cut 3/4 inch slices, fry them in the oven or on the pan with some coconut oil and cinnamon and serve with maple syrup. If you cook them long enough you can barely taste the difference \u2013 they are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Delicious. Here are some other recipes.\nJust a quick reminder, some people don\u2019t react well to the skin of puffball mushrooms (or any mushroom skins). Some mushrooms have tough skin that\u2019s supposed to protect the mushroom from being eaten, this skin can be hard to digest and some people are more sensitive than others.\nIt\u2019s very similar to the skin on certain nuts, if you\u2019ve ever pooped out an intact almond, you know what I\u2019m talking about. Personally, I eat the skin but please be aware that you might have a reaction to it! You can always start by eating a small piece with the skin on, wait a few hours and see how you feel. It can be scary to feel sick after eating a wild mushroom and not know why.\nDo you have any stories to share about puffballs? What\u2019s your record find (size or amount)? What\u2019s your favorite recipe? Share your puffball stories with us in the comments below!\nI find these mushrooms the most rewarding to pick, because even a small one is enough as a side dish to any meal and the bigger ones can feed an entire family! Every time I\u2019ve looked for hens, I found at least one and usually had 2-4 kilos (4-9 pounds) in just 30 minutes of searching. Of course, you can also find a single mushroom that weighs 13+ kilos (30+ pounds).\nLet\u2019s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The hen-of-the-woods (maitake) doesn\u2019t have any poisonous look alikes, grows to be huge so it\u2019s satisfying to find and it\u2019s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\nThe hen-of-the-woods looks a little like the fluffy feathers of a hen, hence it\u2019s name. Here are some photos of how they can look at different stages of growth.\nDon\u2019t confuse the hen-of-the-woods with the chicken-of-the-woods. Chickens can grow higher up on the tree, they are orange and they grow in layers. I have heard a lot about these mushrooms and I\u2019m told they\u2019re delicious, however I haven\u2019t found any yet and I don\u2019t know how to tell them apart from the many other orange mushrooms that grow on trees! Stick with hens at the beginning, you can\u2019t go wrong with them and there are plenty to go around!\nHen-of-the-woods mushrooms typically grow on oak trees, so if you see acorns on the ground you\u2019re in the right spot. If you look at the roots of an oak, you\u2019ll notice that they have a clumpy shape with many little lumps which is very similar to the hen mushroom. From a distance, you might confuse a hen mushroom with some dried leaves. Always go check it out, and take a look around the entire tree. They tend to grow on bigger, wider oaks and there can be a several clusters of them around a single tree!\nHen-of-the-woods are either off-white, kind of beige/grayish or more brownish, especially around it\u2019s rounded edges. They always grow in clumps, so from a distance you could confuse them with clustered mushrooms \u2013 remember that even though it looks like a cluster, it\u2019s one big mushroom that spreads out and looks fluffy. If you cut it at the stem and you see many individual mushrooms, it\u2019s not a hen. If you see any gills (pictured below) it is NOT a hen.\nHens are smooth, fluffy looking, single-stemmed mushrooms.\nRemember, the picture above is NOT a hen-of-the-woods. It\u2019s an example of gills, that hens do NOT have.\nSometimes, the hen-of-the-woods grows on trees other than oaks. If you want to be extra safe, you can stick to only eating the ones that you find on oak trees, although like I already said, there isn\u2019t any dangerous look-a-like. Hens are very unique looking.\nDon\u2019t forget to bring some common sense with you to the forest. If there are too many bugs on the hen, if it looks dry or off-color, then it\u2019s probably not good for eating. While most insects are pretty safe to eat if cooked correctly, you should stay away from unintentional entomophagy. Plus, insects can cause allergic reactions in people who are also allergic to shellfish.\nAnother common sense move is to avoid picking mushrooms in forests where there\u2019s a mark on the tree, or a colorful rope tied around an area. These could mark a protected area, a sick tree, some sort of pest, pollution, disease, etc. If it looks questionable, don\u2019t go there.\nSame goes for roadside mushrooms. Think about the pollution that they are exposed to. Would you like some car exhaust with your mushrooms? I don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t pick anything that looks unclean (not including natural forest dirt) or could be polluted. Similarly to road exhaust, some places could be using pesticides or other chemicals in the area. Although most of us are already exposed to them from the food we buy in supermarkets, the less chemicals we consume, the better.\nWhen you find a hen and bring it home, watch a video on how to clean it correctly. It has many layers, the thick white stem isn\u2019t as yummy as the rest of it so you want to cut that off and if possible, clean it outside or in a large tub to avoid clogging your drain with forest debris. If you see any holes, cut into them and remove any insects, spiders or slugs.\nHow do you cook a hen?\nThere are so many ways to cook these mushrooms! Chop them into tiny pieces and stir fry, with other veggies, or if you\u2019re not vegetarian then maybe some meat, lard or eggs to make the perfect mushroomy omelette.\nThe nutritional value of hens varies depending on the website, but everyone agrees that they have very little fat or protein and lots of vitamin D. Some websites claim that they have very few carbs, others claim that they are 70% carbs. Almost everyone agrees that they are a healthy addition to a balanced diet!\nI tend to use too much olive oil and caramelized onions to make a fatty, crispy, scrumptious meal but there are much healthier alternatives. You can cook them in the oven with coconut oil, you can steam them, boil them, grill them probably even air fry them. Whatever you chose to do, make sure to cook them well as they can be a bit chewy and hard on the stomach if you undercook hens, although this is true for mushrooms in general. You can find various recipes here.\nIf you didn\u2019t manage to find any, or didn\u2019t want to risk picking the wrong mushroom, you can still enjoy eating wild hen-of-the-woods. Check out your local farmers markets from August until November and I guarantee that you\u2019ll find some hens \u2013 generally for $1 per pound!\nDo you enjoy picking mushrooms?

    "text": "Gingerbread and scones are two of those things that really get overlooked. I mean, I\u2019ll be the first person to admit that I\u2019ve never been a scone person. I know they make a great on-the-go breakfast for busy days, but I always thought they would taste a little bit dry and boring. Then, I made these Gingerbread Scones for a holiday-themed brunch and I was blown away. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong! These delightful breakfast pastries are light, soft, and tender. Not to mention that they\u2019re full of festive flavor, thanks to the molasses and gingerbread spices.\nYou can also feel pretty good about eating these tasty treats. We were able to make them without adding any processed sugar, but they taste sweet and satisfying just like your favorite coffee shop treats. Even with swapping in some healthy ingredients (like Greek yogurt, skim milk, and coconut sugar) these pastries bake up with a crisp exterior and a moist, tender crumb inside. And they\u2019re perfectly portion-sized, too. That\u2019s always a good thing for me around the holidays when I need to control my sweet-tooth cravings.\nLike I said, gingerbread often gets overlooked this time of year, thanks to the more-popular flavors of Pumpkin Spice Lattes and pecan pie. People still make gingerbread houses for Christmas, but I don\u2019t think a lot of people are baking up the flavors of gingerbread \u2013 which is a shame! It\u2019s time for us to change that by making these Gingerbread Scones for our friends and family. They\u2019ll be hooked after the first bite, just like me.\nOriginally, people made gingerbread as a way to preserve ginger during Medieval European times. To make the cakes sweeter and more edible, people started heavily flavoring the cakes with molasses. This dark, sticky substance gives a rich and slightly smoky flavor to the cake, along with a punch of nutrition. Blackstrap molasses is full of vitamins and minerals, too, like iron, vitamin B6, selenium, and magnesium. These days, it\u2019s also a popular sweetener for those with diabetes because it helps stabilize blood sugar!\nEventually, gingerbread cakes turned into cookies, muffins, pies, and more. They\u2019re most commonly found as crackers to build gingerbread houses during the holidays, but a recent surge in gingerbread-flavored products is making the spicy cake trendy again. We\u2019re pretty happy about that, especially after eating these Gingerbread Scones.\nAlmost all good scones are topped with a sugary glaze. It\u2019s usually sinfully sweet because it\u2019s little more than powdered sugar and milk. We wanted to capture the spirit of the glaze without putting anyone into a diabetic shock. Luckily, Greek yogurt makes a perfect substitute!\nBy the time you whip the tangy yogurt together with the maple syrup and vanilla extract, it will be completely transformed. No one will know it used to be yogurt. If you have a hard time finding plain Greek yogurt, feel free to swap-in one of the flavored varieties. Try to find neutral flavors that will go well with the Gingerbread Scone, though, like vanilla, honey, or coconut flavors.\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, coconut sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Note: add 2 cups floor, then add a little at a time until it makes a cookie dough like consistency.\nGrate the butter on a box grater and mix it into the flour with your hands until the mixture resembles lumpy, wet sand.\nGently mix in the molasses, 1/2 cup of the yogurt, and milk. Once the mixture comes together, turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and gently knead it using your hands until a dough comes together.\nForm the dough into a large circle about 1-inch deep. Cut the circle into 8 equal slices.\nPlace the slices on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, until lightly browned on the outside. A toothpick inserted into the center of the scone should come out clean.\nMeanwhile, make the drizzle by whisking together the remaining tablespoon of Greek yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag.\nAllow the scones to cool for 10 minutes before drizzling the glaze over the scones.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for healthy holiday recipes or something for everyday eating, we have a recipe for you!

YES Coconut Milk is a suitable substitute for skim milk. Use the same amount that the recipe indicates. Have a great DAY!\nAny substitutes for coconut sugar? Wheat flour?\nDiane, Cane sugar, date sugar, or brown sugar will work. All purpose flour will work in place of wheat.\nCan you please recommend the best Gluten Free flour or Gluten free flour blend ( any recommendation but rice flour though, and no blends that contain rice. I\u2019m *super* allergic to rice\u2026.)that would work for this recipe, for those of us that have to eat gluten free?\nHi Alli, There aren\u2019t too many without rice. I found this brand for all-purpose, gluten-free flour on amazon.",

    "text": "The day is drawing near when the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church will celebrate the fourth centenary of the union between the Bishops of the Metropolia of Kievan Rus' and the Apostolic See. The union was effected at the meeting of representatives of the Metropolia of Kiev with the Pope on 23 December 1595 and was solemnly proclaimed at Brest-Litovsk on the River Bug on 16 October 1596. Pope Clement VIII, in the Apostolic Constitution Magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis,1 announced the union to the whole Church and in the Apostolic Letter Benedictus sit Pastor2 he addressed the Bishops of the Metropolia, informing them that the union had taken place.\nThe Union of Brest opened a new page in the history of the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine.4 Today that Church wishes to sing with joy a hymn of thanksgiving and praise to the One who, once more, has brought it back from death to life, and it wishes to set forth with renewed enthusiasm on the path marked out by the Second Vatican Council.\nJoining the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in this thanksgiving and petition are the Greek Catholic Churches of the diaspora which date back to the Union of Brest, together with the other Eastern Catholic Churches and the entire Church.\nAs the Bishop of Rome, I too wish to unite myself to the Catholics of the Byzantine tradition in those lands. For many years, during my pastoral ministry in Poland, I sensed a physical as well as a spiritual closeness with that Church, which was then undergoing such difficult trials. After my election to the See of Peter, I considered it a pressing duty, following the example of my Predecessors, to speak out in defence of its right to exist and freely to profess its faith, at a time when both these rights were being denied. I now have the privilege of joyfully sharing in its celebration of these days of regained freedom.\n2. The celebrations commemorating the Union of Brest must be seen in the context of the Millennium of the Baptism of the Rus'. Seven years ago, in 1988, that event was celebrated with great solemnity. For the occasion I published two documents: the Apostolic Letter Euntes in mundum of 25 January 1988,5 for the whole Church, and the Message Magnum Baptismi donum, of 14 February of the same year,6 addressed to Ukrainian Catholics. It was an occasion for celebrating a moment of fundamental importance for the Christian and cultural identity of those peoples, a moment of unique significance, since at that time the Churches of the Byzantine tradition and the Church of Rome were still living in full communion.\nAfter the division which damaged the unity between the West and the Byzantine East, frequent and intense efforts were made to restore full communion. I wish to mention two particularly significant events: the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, and above all the Council of Florence in 1439, when protocols of union with the Eastern Churches were signed. Unfortunately, various causes prevented the promise and potential of those agreements from being realized.\nThe Bishops of the Metropolia of Kiev, in restoring communion with Rome, made explicit reference to the decisions of the Council of Florence, a Council which had numbered among its participants representatives from the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nIn this context, the figure of Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev stands out. As a faithful interpreter and defender of the decisions of that Council, he had to endure exile for his convictions.\nThe Bishops who promoted the union and the members of their Church retained a lively awareness of their original close ties to their Orthodox brethren, together with a full consciousness of the Oriental identity of their Metropolia, an identity which was also to be upheld after the union. In the history of the Catholic Church, it is a highly significant fact that this just desire was respected and that the act of union did not involve passing over to the Latin tradition, as some thought would happen. Their Church saw an acknowledgment of its right to be governed by its own hierarchy with a specific discipline and to maintain its Eastern liturgical and spiritual heritage.\n3. After the union, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church enjoyed a period in which its ecclesiastical structures flourished, with resulting benefits for religious life, the education of the clergy and the spiritual commitment of the faithful. With remarkable farsightedness, great importance was attached to education. Thanks to the valuable contribution of the Basilian Order and other Religious Congregations, there was a great growth in the study of the sacred sciences and the nation's culture. In the present century, a figure of extraordinary prestige, in this regard as well as in his witness of suffering borne for Christ, was Metropolitan Andrii Sheptyckyi, whose education and fine spiritual qualities were combined with outstanding organizational gifts. He founded schools and academies, supported theological studies and the human sciences, the press and sacred art, and sought to preserve historical memories.\nAnd yet, all this ecclesial vitality was continually marked by the tragedy of misunderstanding and opposition. An illustrious victim in this regard was the Archbishop of Polock and Vitebsk, Josaphat Kuntsevych, whose martyrdom merited the unfading crown of eternal glory. His body now lies in the Vatican Basilica, where it is continuously venerated with devotion and gratitude by Catholics from throughout the world.\nOutstanding among the heroic witnesses to the rights not only of the faith but also of human conscience in those difficult years is the figure of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj: his courage in enduring exile and prison for 18 years and his indomitable confidence in the resurrection of his Church make him one of the most powerful figures among the confessors of the faith in our time. Nor should his many companions in punishment be forgotten, particularly Bishops Hryhory Khomyshyn and Josaphat Kocylowskyj.\nThese tempestuous events shook the Church in the homeland to its roots. But Divine Providence had already begun to make it possible for many of its members to find a way of escape for themselves and their people. From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, great waves of emigrants began to cross the ocean, settling above all in Canada, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The Holy See took care to be close to them, by providing assistance and establishing pastoral structures for them in their new homes, including the establishment of their own Eparchies. At the time of trial, during the atheistic persecution in their native land, the voice of these believers could thus be raised, in full freedom, with strength and courage. In the international forum they defended the right of their persecuted brethren to religious freedom, and thus strengthened the Second Vatican Council's appeal for religious freedom,8 and the efforts made in this regard by the Holy See.\n4. The whole Catholic Community recalls with deep emotion the victims of such great suffering: the martyrs and confessors of the faith of the Church in Ukraine offer us a magnificent lesson in fidelity even at the price of life itself. And we, the favoured witnesses of their sacrifice, are aware that they helped to maintain the dignity of a world which seemed overwhelmed by atrocities. They knew the truth, and the truth set them free. Christians in Europe and throughout the world, pausing in prayer before the concentration camps and prisons, should be grateful for the light which they gave: it was the light of Christ, which they caused to shine in the darkness. For long years the darkness seemed in the eyes of the world to prevail, but it was not able to extinguish that light, which was the light of God and the light of man, wounded but not laid low.\nThis inheritance of suffering and glory today stands at a historic crossroads: now that the chains of imprisonment have been broken, the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine has begun again to breathe in freedom and to regain fully its own active role in the Church and in history. This task, difficult yet providential, today calls for particular reflection, that it may be carried out with wisdom and farsightedness.\n5. The celebration of the Union of Brest should be lived and interpreted in the light of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. This is perhaps the most important aspect for understanding the significance of the anniversary.\nIt is well known that the Second Vatican Council made a special point of studying the mystery of the Church, and that one of the most important documents which it produced was the Constitution Lumen gentium. Precisely because of this detailed study the Council takes on a particular ecumenical significance. This is confirmed by the Decree Unitatis redintegratio, which presents a very enlightened programme of activities to be carried out in the work for Christian unity. Thirty years after the conclusion of the Council, I wished to reiterate this programme with my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint, published on 25 May of this year.9 This Encyclical traces the ecumenical progress which has been made since the Second Vatican Council and, at the same time, looking to the third millennium of the Christian era, it seeks to open up new possibilities for the future.\nPutting the celebrations of the coming year in the context of a reflection on the Church, as proposed by the Council, I am anxious above all to encourage a deeper understanding of the proper role which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is called to play today in the ecumenical movement.\nTo promote dialogue with the Byzantine Orthodox Churches, there was set up, after the Second Vatican Council, a special Mixed Commission which also included among its members representatives of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\nIn various documents efforts have been made to arrive at a deeper and greater understanding between the Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches, efforts which have not been without positive results. In my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen11 and in my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint12 I have already written of the elements of sanctification and truth13 common to Eastern and Western Christianity, and of the desirable path to follow in the search for full communion between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches, in the light of the greater ecclesiological understanding brought about by the Second Vatican Council: \"Today we know that unity can be achieved through the love of God only if the Churches want it together, in full respect for the traditions of each and for necessary autonomy. We know that this can take place only on the basis of the love of Churches which feel increasingly called to manifest the one Church of Christ, born from one Baptism and from one Eucharist, and which want to be sisters\".14 The deepening of knowledge of the doctrine on the Church, brought about by the Council and continuing since the Council, has marked out what can be called a new path on the journey to unity: the path of the dialogue of truth nourished and sustained by the dialogue of charity (cf. Eph 4: 15).\n7. The shift from an underground existence has meant a radical change in the situation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church: this Church has found itself facing the grave problems of rebuilding the structures of which it had been completely deprived and, more generally, it has had to commit itself to rediscovering itself fully, not only from within, but also in relation to the other Churches.\nThanks be to God for having enabled it to celebrate this jubilee with religious freedom regained. Thanks be to God also for the growth of the dialogue of charity, whereby significant progress has been made on the road to the much desired reconciliation with the Orthodox Churches.\nNumerous migrations and deportations have redrawn the religious geography of those lands; many years of official State atheism have profoundly affected people's minds; there is still not enough clergy to respond to the immense needs of religious and moral reconstruction: these are some of the more dramatic challenges facing all of the Churches.\nIn the face of these difficulties a common witness of charity is required, in order that the proclamation of the Gospel may not be impeded. As I said in my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen, \"today we can co-operate in proclaiming the Kingdom or we can become the upholders of new divisions\".15 May the Lord guide our feet into the way of peace.\n8. In the new-found freedom we cannot forget the persecution and martyrdom which the Churches of that region, both Catholic and Orthodox, suffered in their own flesh. This is an important aspect for the Church of all times, as I recalled in my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente.16 It concerns a particularly significant heritage of the Churches of Europe, which remain profoundly marked by it: this needs to be studied in the light of the Word of God.\nRemembrance of the martyrs cannot be erased from the memory of the Church or of humanity: whether victims of the ideologies of the East or of the West, all of them are brought together in fellowship by the violence whereby hatred for the faith violated the dignity of the human person, created by God \"in his image and likeness\".\nPope John XXIII was fond of repeating: \"What unites us is much greater than what divides us\". I am convinced that this attitude can be a great benefit to all the Churches. More than 30 years have gone by since the Pope made this statement. In this period of time there have been many indications which suggest to us that Christians have made progress in this direction. Eloquent signs of this progress have been the fraternal meetings between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I, and those which I myself have had with the Ecumenical Patriarchs Dimitrios and, more recently, Bartholomaios, and with other venerable Patriarchs of the Churches of the East. All this, together with the many initiatives involving meetings and dialogue which are being promoted everywhere in the Church, encourages us to have hope: the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of unity, does not cease to work among Christians still separated from one another.\nAnd yet human weakness and sin continue to resist the Spirit of unity. Sometimes one even has the impression that there are forces ready to do almost anything in order to slow down, and even put an end to, the movement towards Christian unity. But we cannot give in: daily we must find the courage and strength, which at one and the same time are the gift of the Spirit and the result of human effort, to continue on the path already undertaken.\n10. In recalling the Union of Brest we must ask ourselves what this event means today. It was a union which concerned only a particular geographical region, but it is relevant for the entire field of ecumenism. The Eastern Catholic Churches can make a very important contribution to ecumenism. The Council's Decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum reminds us that \"the Eastern Churches in communion with the Apostolic See of Rome have a special role to play in promoting the unity of all Christians, particularly Easterners, according to the principles of this sacred Synod's Decree on Ecumenism: first of all by prayer, then by the example of their lives, by religious fidelity to ancient Eastern traditions, by greater mutual knowledge, by collaboration, and by a brotherly regard for objects and attitudes\".20 From this it follows that Eastern Catholics are to commit themselves to living profoundly what the Decree lays out. They are asked to make a confession of faith full of humility and gratitude to the Holy Spirit, who guides the Church towards the fulfilment promised her by the Redeemer of the world.\n11. Prayer will therefore be the fundamental element which should mark the celebration of this jubilee. Such prayer above all involves giving thanks for all that has been accomplished, down the centuries, by commitment to the Church's unity, and especially for the impulse given to the search for unity as a result of the Second Vatican Council.\nThis prayer is one of thanksgiving to the Lord, who guides the unfolding of history, for the situation of new-found religious freedom in which this jubilee is being celebrated. It is also an appeal to the Spirit-Paraclete, that he may cause to flourish everything which promotes unity, and may give courage and strength to all those who commit themselves, according to the guidelines of the Council's Decree Unitatis redintegratio, to this work blessed by God. It is a plea for the gift of brotherly love, and for the forgiveness of offences and injustices suffered in the course of history. It is a petition that the power of the living God will bring good even out of the cruel and many-faceted evil caused by acts of human malice. This prayer also expresses hope for the future of the ecumenical journey: the power of God is greater than all human weaknesses, whether old or new. If this jubilee of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, on the threshold of the third millennium, marks a step forward towards full Christian unity, this result will be first of all the work of the Holy Spirit.\n12. The jubilee celebrations should also be a time of reflection. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church must first of all ask itself what full communion with the Apostolic See meant for it in the past, and what it will mean for it in the future. In a spirit of humble thanksgiving, the Greek Catholic Church will give glory to God, for its heroic fidelity to the Successor of Peter and, under the action of the Holy Spirit, it will understand that today this same fidelity commits it to fostering the unity of all the Churches. This fidelity cost it sufferings and martyrdom in the past: this is a sacrifice offered to God in order to implore the hoped-for union.\n13. We cannot fail to entrust the yearning for full Christian unity to the Mother of Christ, she who is ever present in the work of the Lord and of his Church. Chapter Eight of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium points to her as the one who goes before us on our earthly pilgrimage of faith and is tenderly present to the Church which, at the end of the second millennium, is working to re-establish among all those who believe in Christ that unity which the Lord wills for them. Because she is the Mother of the one Christ, she is the Mother of unity. Since Mary, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gave birth to the Son of God, who received from her his human body, she ardently wills the visible unity of all believers who make up the Mystical Body of Christ. The veneration of Mary, which unites East and West so intimately, will serve, I am convinced, the cause of unity.\nThe Most Holy Virgin, already present everywhere in our midst both in so many sacred buildings and in the life of faith of so many families continuously speaks of unity, a unity for which she constantly intercedes. If today, in commemorating the Union of Brest, we recall the marvellous wealth of veneration that the Christian people of the Ukraine have offered to the Mother of God, we cannot but draw from this admiration for the history, spirituality and prayer of those peoples the consequences for unity which are so closely linked to those treasures.\nMary, who has inspired in their trials fathers and mothers, young people, the sick and the aged; Mary, the column of fire capable of guiding so many martyrs of the faith, is certainly at work in preparing the hoped-for union of all Christians: in the light of this, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church certainly has its own role to play.\nTo Mary the Church offers her thanks and asks her to make us share her concern for unity. With filial trust let us abandon ourselves to her, that we may be with her where God will be all in all.\nTo you, dear Brothers and Sisters, I impart my Apostolic Blessing.\nFrom the Vatican, on 12 November, Memorial of Saint Josaphat, in the year 1995, the eighteenth of my Pontificate.\n1) Cf.

    "text": "Gestational Diabetes Mellitus - Home Treatment.\nJust like any type of diabetes, gestational diabetes needs more than medicine to get it treated successfully. It needs you, for you are the person who determines the health of your pregnancy.\nYour registered dietitian, diabetes educator, your doctor and other members of your healthcare team can teach you about proper care for yourself and your baby so that both of you are protected from any complications that may arise. If you have all the necessary knowledge available on gestational diabetes, there can be no problem during and after your pregnancy. Once you know the effects of exercise and food on your blood glucose levels, you can avoid gestational diabetes complications.\nTesting your blood glucose level, regular exercise and changes in the time, amount and types of food you eat are important in gestational diabetes home treatment.\nChanging the type of food you eat, eating at regular times and the quantity consumed at each meal can ensure that your blood glucose level remain in a safe range. After your gestational diabetes diagnosis, a registered dietitian will help you to plan meals suitable for you. You may be required to keep a record of the foods you consume and your weight. Your dietitian will also show you how to carbohydrate counting so that you eat almost the same amount at each meal to reach a certain total at the end of each day.\nModerate exercise done regularly throughout the pregnancy improves the sensitivity of your body towards insulin and this helps blood glucose level control. Most of the time, eating the right foods and exercise are sufficient for gestational diabetes treatment. There should be a minimum of two and a half hours of moderate exercise each week. To accomplish this takes only 30 minutes of exercise each day for five days or more a week. You can even do 10 minute sessions so long as you get a total of 2\u00c2\u00bd hours each week.\nFor pregnant women who have been leading a sedentary life or have no regular exercise before pregnancy, they need to discuss with their doctor before any regular exercise. Suitable exercises for pregnant women are those that do not strain the lower part of the body. So, it is fine to exercise the arm muscles by using a machine known as the arm ergometer; or exercise the leg muscles by using a recumbent bike which has a chair-like seat that is suitable for women who are pregnant. There are also exercise classes especially for women who are pregnant. Walking and swimming are two low-impact exercises which are also suitable.\nIf it is possible for you to get your blood glucose to remain in the safe range through changes in your eating and exercise, it will not be necessary for you to take any diabetes medication. However, if you need insulin, keep ready with you some sugary food like 4 glucose tablets or some hard candy so that you can use them if you get low blood glucose symptoms such as confusion, blurred vision and sweating during exercise. If you believe your blood glucose level is too low, stop the activity, test your blood glucose level, and consume the sugary foods you have.\nDoing home blood glucose level testing is a necessary part of gestational diabetes treatment. You will need to do blood glucose checking at home at least once every day. It can be tough when you have to check your blood glucose frequently but from such testing, you will know you have no need to worry as your blood glucose level is in the safe range. Find out from your doctor how often you should check your blood glucose.\nDaily insulin injections may be necessary if your blood glucose level cannot be managed through exercising and the way you eat.\nDo not attempt to reduce weight during pregnancy if you were already overweight before the pregnancy. Find out from your doctor the possible weight increase during your pregnancy.\nYou may be taught by your doctor to count the number of kicks by your baby. You are required to notify your doctor if there is less than the usual number of kicks from the baby.\nYour blood glucose level can go lower than the safe range if you use insulin for your gestational diabetes. Although women with gestational diabetes seldom experience low blood glucose, you should know its symptoms and be prepared with sugary foods throughout the day.",

    "text": "The Walt Disney Company Announces its Intention to Launch a Tender Offer for all Remaining Euro Disney Shares and a mandatory buy-out if the 95% threshold is reached.\nThe Walt Disney Company released a Press Statement this morning advising of Disney\u2019s intention to purchase all the remaining shares in Euro Disney S.C.A. and support a recapitalization of up to \u20ac1.5 billion for the Euro Disney group of companies to enable the Group to continue implementation of improvements to Disneyland\u00ae Paris, reduce debt and increase liquidity.\n\u2013 The Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201c) announces the acquisition of 90% of Kingdom Holding Company\u2019s (\u201cKingdom\u201d) interest in Euro Disney S.C.A. (\u201cEuro Disney\u201d), representing 9% of Euro Disney\u2019s outstanding shares.\n\u2013 The proposed transaction will increase Disney\u2019s interest in Euro Disney to 85.7% from 76.7%.\n\u2013 The price for the transaction is \u20ac2.00 per share and will be paid in shares of Disney common stock.\n\u2013 Disney also announces its intention to make a cash tender offer for all remaining outstanding shares of Euro Disney at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, representing a 67% premium to Euro Disney\u2019s trading price at its close on February 9, 2017.\n\u2013 Subsequent to the completion of the tender offer, Disney is committed to support a recapitalization of up to \u20ac1.5 billion for the Euro Disney group of companies (\u201cGroup\u201d) to address the Group\u2019s financial needs.\nPARIS, Feb. 10, 2017 \u2013 Today The Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201c) announced that it will acquire through one of its subsidiaries 90% of Kingdom Holding Company\u2019s (\u201cKingdom\u201d) shares in Euro Disney S.C.A. (\u201cEuro Disney\u201d) at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, increasing its interest in Euro Disney to 85.7%. Disney also announced that this subsidiary intends to make a cash tender offer for all remaining outstanding shares of Euro Disney at a price of \u20ac2.00 per share, representing a 67% premium to the trading price at the close on February 9, 2017. Moreover, Disney has informed Euro Disney that it is committed to support a recapitalization of up to \u20ac1.5 billion for the Euro Disney group of companies (\u201cGroup\u201d) to enable the Group to continue implementation of improvements to Disneyland\u00ae Paris, reduce debt and increase liquidity.\n\u2013 If Euro Disney remains a listed company, Disney would expect the recapitalization to take the form of a subscription by the applicable Disney subsidiaries of their pro-rata share of a \u20ac1.23 billion rights offering by Euro Disney together with a backstop of (and at the same price as) the rights offering by one or more of such subsidiaries, ensuring that Euro Disney will be able to raise the full amount contemplated by the rights offering, combined with a direct \u20ac270 million cash investment in equity at the level of Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A., the main operating subsidiary of Euro Disney, and contribution of the proceeds of the rights offering by Euro Disney to Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A. to maintain the ownership level of Euro Disney Associ\u00e9s S.C.A. by Euro Disney at its current 82%. Proceeds would be used to enable the Group to continue implementation of improvements to Disneyland Paris, repay most or all of the Group\u2019s indebtedness and increase liquidity. The rights offering described above would be subject to the prior approval of Euro Disney\u2019s shareholders at a shareholders\u2019 meeting.\n\u2013 If Euro Disney is delisted, Disney would expect the recapitalization to be in the same amount and to also consist entirely of equity contributions to the Group, but the allocation of such contributions between Euro Disney and its subsidiaries could vary compared to what is described above. The proceeds would be used for the same purposes as described above.\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading diversified international entertainment and media enterprise with the following business segments: media networks, parks and resorts, studio entertainment, and consumer products and interactive media.

    "text": "Let\u2019s take a dive into some of the things we\u2019re working on behind the scenes!\nWe\u2019re looking at ways to make battling, building, and moving in Fortnite feel great on controller. We took an initial step with Builder Pro and feedback from you to create a better experience for console players swapping between building pieces.\nWe heard your feedback about Builder Pro feeling inconsistent. Sometimes after quickly switching to a building piece, it would not place when you pressed the button. Similarly, Turbo Building could force you to let go and re-press to start building again, making it unreliable. We\u2019ve fixed these issues, and Builder Pro should feel consistent.\nIn the v4.3 update we\u2019ve fixed various reported problems with the Turbo Building feature, such as building being cancelled while cycling through traps or after pressing certain combinations of buttons.\nWe\u2019ve also made Turbo Building faster so that gaps won\u2019t appear in your structures when aiming quickly. The first time you begin building it takes 0.15 seconds to build, but each piece after that is faster (0.05 seconds). Combined with Builder Pro, this gives you enough time to select a piece and rotate or edit it before placing.\nWhen playing with a controller and using Edit Mode to modify your buildings, aim assist will kick in and pull your crosshair toward the closest square. It will also try to confine your aim to the building piece you're editing. We've heard that some players find this feature uncomfortable to play with, so you'll be able to toggle Edit Mode Aim Assist off in the v4.3 update.\nLooking to the future, we want to provide for the best experience on console and that involves giving you the options to play however you wish. We\u2019re investigating giving you ways to bind actions to whichever buttons you would prefer to use. Additionally we\u2019re investigating other aspects like stick axis remapping. We\u2019re not sure when this will land, but we\u2019ll give you more info once its fully tested!\nWe\u2019ve been using LTMs to take existing aspects of the game and try new things with them (i.e. legendary loot in Solid Gold or faster games in Blitz). We look at LTMs as a space that allows us to explore different tweaks to the main game mode (e.g. Building Resources) and do things we wouldn\u2019t normally do in standard playlists.\nWe\u2019ve heard you about your love for 50v50 and we\u2019re currently evaluating keeping a larger squad mode live at all times for those who enjoy that type of battling more!\nWe took our first step into what a competitive playlist may look like with Solo Showdown. Creating a separate space for players who wanted to compete towards a prize while exploring how competitive play might look in Fortnite.\nWe introduced the Jetpack this week as our a Limited Time Item. Our goal is to introduce items that change gameplay in big & unique ways. We\u2019re going to keep a close eye on your feedback and the data we collect. You\u2019ll also see the Jetpack featured in our Close Encounter LTM going live tomorrow!\nThe Playground LTM will load you into the Battle Royale Map with some adjusted settings.\nBattle and build to your heart's content with an extended period of time to roam around the map as well as increased resource generation. All treasure chests and ammo crates will be spawned, try droppin\u2019 in different spots and scope out the loot. Friendly fire is on so you can scrimmage with your squad (up to 4 friends per match), but fear not you\u2019ll respawn immediately.\nOh \u2026 and Lloads of Llamas.\nThis represents our initial step into what a creative mode looks like in Fortnite. Practice, strategize and enjoy yourself. We can\u2019t wait to see what you do!\nWhen you hop on to play Fortnite after a long day at work or in classes we want that first match to feel as good as the last one. Performance is an aspect of the game that is very important to us and something we are committed to improving over time. Here are a few of the ways we\u2019re working to smooth out your daily play!\nIn the v4.1 update we issued a hotfix to address some long hitches, but we\u2019re still seeing reports of these hitches in our data. We\u2019ve added additional logging and diagnostics to help us track down issues that can cause the game to freeze. When you use in the in-game feedback report feature, it will allow us to diagnose these issues.\nWe know that many of the hitches happen because the game is stopping to load content at unexpected times in the middle of the match, instead of smoothly streaming the data in the background. The game will now be able to directly report these loading problems to our team. We've also added a new system to more reliably pre-load content before the match starts, so that new loading hitches don't sneak back into future updates.\nWe want to get you into a match in as short a time as possible after you hit play! We\u2019ve been working to improve file performance, ensure cosmetics are loaded in time, and reducing overall load times. By optimizing order of assets in our patches we reduced load times on console by 15-30 seconds in the v3.5 update. Each major release we regularly update the order of assets in order to keep load times down.\nWe recently boosted the server tick rates from 20 Hz to a solid 30 Hz in standard game modes. This means the server is updating the game 50% faster than before and should improve the responsiveness of your actions in the game. But we still have work to do. Fast and consistent server performance is extremely important to us, and we\u2019re still working hard at it.\nOur next goal is to ensure that \u201clarge team\u201d LTMs like 50v50 are hitting 30Hz for the entire match.\nFor large team modes we\u2019ve made optimizations to adapt and update players based on what they\u2019re doing in game. Players who are standing still don\u2019t need to update everyone around them very frequently compared to players who are running and gunning. Similarly, very distant players are updated less frequently, especially players that aren't visible to you. These optimizations allow our servers to handle larger numbers of players.\nCurrently the game throttles the frequency that your player's movement data is sent over the network to 20Hz for roughly the first half of the game. This is reduce strain on the server's physics system, allowing it to maintain frame rate. As the number of players participating in the match reduces to 24, we increase the frequency of updates to 33Hz. Over time we\u2019ll improve performance of server physics calculations, and we expect to be able to remove this throttling in a future update.\nWe\u2019re continuing to improve the core gameplay experience, and have a number of features in progress!\nStarting in v4.3 there will be in-match pop ups to highlight your challenge progress. Track what you\u2019ve completed and plan out your strategy for the remainder of the match or your next one!\nMarking positions on the map is a great way to communicate with your squad, but often the marker on the compass isn\u2019t enough to get you to your location. We\u2019re investigating ways to display an in-world marker to allow for easier navigation around the island.\nGetting a Victory Royale should be a memorable experience, and the victory screen should support that. We want to freshen up the celebration and make it a bit more rewarding.\nThe ability to zoom in on the map was added in a recent update, but the resolution of the image isn\u2019t quite as good as we want it to be. Our goal is to capture the world with as many details as possible to make it easier when figuring out where you're droppin\u2019!\nOur v4.2 update had some footstep audio improvements, where we added slightly more variation to above/below sounds. We recognize it\u2019s still difficult to identify enemy position in high-density locations (such as Tilted Towers) and we\u2019ll continue to iterate on this.\nAll outfits and cosmetics have value. We want to add ways for you to gain additional goodies through collection over time! This is work in progress - and it\u2019s a little further out.\nIn preparation for our Celebrity Pro-Am at E3 we've been hard at work making some improvements to the replay system.\nWe\u2019re developing new camera features that allow you to orbit around any point of your choosing as well having the camera automatically track the action for you by focusing on a group of players, rather than just one person.\nWe\u2019ve also been refining the map view in replays to add more functionality to the playerlist and to add bullet trajectories to the player markers on the map. Additionally, player nameplates have been tweaked to avoid overlapping where possible.\nFinally, we\u2019ve also been looking at improving player outlines and adding an x-ray view for when players enter buildings or actively building themselves so that you always have the best view of what\u2019s happening.\nWe're excited to get these new features and improvements into everyone's hands and will be releasing them as part of the game as soon as they are battle tested and ready! Keep an eye on our patch notes for all the details.",

    "text": "We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriously.\nIf the people of that time were so gullible or credulous or superstitious, then we have to be very cautious when assessing the reliability of witnesses of Jesus. As Thomas Jefferson believed when he composed his own version of the gospels, Jesus may have been an entirely different person than the Gospels tell us, since the supernatural and other facts about him, even some of his parables or moral sayings, could easily have been added or exaggerated by unreliable witnesses or storytellers. Thus, this essay is not about whether Jesus was real or how much of what we are told about him is true. It is not even about Jesus. Rather, this essay is a warning and a standard, by which we can assess how likely or easily what we are told about Jesus may be false or exaggerated, and how little we can trust anyone who claims to be a witness of what he said and did. For if all of these other stories below could be told and believed, even by Christians themselves, it follows that the Gospels, being of entirely the same kind, can all too easily be inaccurate, tainted by the gullibility, credulity, or fondness for the spectacular which characterized most people of the time.\nEven in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.\nBeyond the bible, the historian Josephus supplies some insights. Writing toward the end of the first century, himself an eye-witness of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D, he tells us that the region was filled with \"cheats and deceivers claiming divine inspiration\" (Jewish War, 2.259-60; Jewish Antiquities, 20.167), entrancing the masses and leading them like sheep, usually to their doom. The most successful of these \"tricksters\" appears to be \"the Egyptian\" who led a flock of 30,000 believers around Palestine (Jewish War, 2.261-2; Paul is mistaken for him by a Roman officer in Acts 21:38). This fellow even claimed he could topple the walls of Jerusalem with a single word (Jewish Antiquities, 20.170), yet it took a massacre at the hands of Roman troops to finally instill doubt in his followers.\nTwenty years later, a common weaver named Jonathan would attract a mob of the poor and needy, promising to show them many signs and portents (Jewish War, 7.437-8). Again, it took military intervention to disband the movement. Josephus also names a certain Theudas, another \"trickster\" who gathered an impressive following in Cyrene around 46 A.D., claiming he was a prophet and could part the river Jordan (Jewish Antiquities, 20.97). This could be the same Theudas mentioned in Acts 5:36. Stories like these also remind us of the faithful following that Simon was reported to have had in Acts 8:9-11, again showing how easy it was to make people believe you had \"the power of god\" at your disposal. Jesus was not unique in that respect.\nMiracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!\nMiraculous healings were also commonplace. Suetonius, another biographer writing a generation after Plutarch, reports that even the emperor Vespasian once cured the blind and lame (Life of Vespasian 7.13; this \"power\" being attributed to the god Serapis--incidentally the Egyptian counterpart to Asclepius; cf. also Tacitus, Histories 4.81). Likewise, statues with healing powers were common attractions for sick people of this era. Lucian mentions the famous healing powers of a statue of Polydamas, an athlete, at Olympia, as well as the statue of Theagenes at Thasos (Council of the Gods 12). Both are again mentioned by Pausanias, in his \"tour guide\" of the Roman world (6.5.4-9, 11.2-9). Lucian also mentions the curative powers of the statue of a certain General Pellichos (Philopseudes 18-20). And Athenagoras, in his Legatio pro Christianis (26), polemicizes against the commonplace belief in the healing powers of statues, mentioning, in addition to the statue of a certain Neryllinus, the statues of Proteus and Alexander, the same two men I discuss in detail below.\nBut above all these, the \"pagans\" had Asclepius, their own healing savior, centuries before, and after, the ministry of Christ. Surviving testimonies to his influence and healing power throughout the classical age are common enough to fill a two-volume book (Edelstein and Edelstein, Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies, in two volumes, 1945--entries 423-450 contain the most vivid testimonials). Of greatest interest are the inscriptions set up for those healed at his temples. These give us almost first hand testimony, more reliable evidence than anything we have for the miracles of Jesus, of the blind, the lame, the mute, even the victims of kidney stones, paralytics, and one fellow with a spearhead stuck in his jaw (see the work cited above, p. 232), all being cured by this pagan \"savior.\" And this testimony goes on for centuries. Inscriptions span from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. and later, all over the Roman Empire. Clearly, the people of this time were quite ready to believe such tales. They were not remarkable tales at all.\nThis more general evidence of credulity in the Roman Empire shows the prevalence of belief in divine miracle working of all kinds. I will now present you with three historical individuals who truly flesh out the picture.\nApollonius, Peregrinus, and Alexander are three rather interesting religious founders about whom we know even more than we do of Jesus. The first, Apollonius of Tyana, is often called the \"pagan Christ,\" since he also lived during the first century, and performed a similar ministry of miracle-working, preaching his own brand of ascetic Pythagoreanism--he was also viewed as the son of a god, resurrected the dead, ascended to heaven, performed various miracles, and criticized the authorities with pithy wisdom much like Jesus did.\nNaturally, his story is one that no doubt grew into more and more fantastic legends over time, until he becomes an even more impressive miracle-worker than Jesus in the largest surviving work on him, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written by Philostratus around 220 A.D. This work is available today in two volumes as part of the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, a set that also includes the surviving fragments of Apollonius' own writings (if only Jesus had bothered to write something!) as well as the Treatise against him by the Christian historian Eusebius. There were other books written about him immediately after his death, but none survive.\nEven Eusebius, in his Treatise against Apollonius, does not question his existence, or the reality of many of his miracles--rather, he usually tries to attribute them to trickery or demons. This shows the credulity of the times, even among educated defenders of the Christian faith, but it also shows how easy it was to deceive. Since they readily believed in demons and magical powers, it should not surprise us that they believed in resurrections and transmutations of water to wine.\nWe also know that the cult that grew up around Apollonius survived for many centuries after his death. An inscription from as late as the 3rd century names him as a sort of pagan \"absolver of sins,\" sent from heaven (Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., 1996). The emperor Caracalla erected a shrine to him in Tyana around 215 A.D (Dio Cassius, 78.18; for a miraculous display of clairvoyance on the part of Apollonius, see 67.18). According to one account, the ghost of Apollonius even appeared to the emperor Aurelian to convince him to stop his siege of Tyana, whereupon he also erected a shrine to him around 274 A.D. (Historia Augusta: Vita Aureliani 24.2-6).\nLater Arabic sources even discuss the fame and potency of certain relics associated with him, which remained in use well into the sixth and seventh centuries, the last of them apparently destroyed by crusaders in 1204 A.D. So popular was the belief in the power of these \"talismans\" that the Church was forced to accept their use, even while condemning Apollonius and his shrines as demonic (see sources below). And so, we see here an independent confirmation that blind belief in the divine status and miraculous powers of mere mortals easily captivated the people of this time, a fact that even modern Christians must admit.\nAn even more colorful story is that of a crazy fellow called Peregrinus, nicknamed \"Proteus,\" who set himself on fire during the Olympic games in 165 A.D. to prove his faith in reincarnation. The notion of suicide as a proof of such faith was not new. Indian Brahmans had immolated themselves before Western audiences on several occasions before, the most famous being Calanus, at Susa, in front of Alexander the Great, and Zarmarus, at Athens, in front of Augustus (Plutarch, Alexander 69.8). What is most relevant, however, is the fascinating story told about him by the skeptic Lucian in his satirical work, \"The Death of Peregrinus.\" Lucian knew Proteus personally, and he gives us a look at what the story of Jesus might have been had a skeptic been around to give us a different account.\nWhile Aulus Gellius had also met this man in Athens, and was impressed enough to call him a man of \"dignity and fortitude\" (Attic Nights 11.1-7), Lucian had another point of view. He describes the vainglorious motivations of Proteus, and the duped mobs clamoring for a miracle. He also mentions the gullibility of Christians, who, he says, were easily duped by scam artists (13). Indeed, after the death of Peregrinus, people reported that he was, like Jesus, risen from the dead, wearing white raiment, and that he ascended to heaven in the form of a vulture (40). The punch line is that this latter story may have been a deliberate invention of Lucian himself (39), told to gullible followers, and later recounted to him as if it were fact, showing the effects of the rumor mill at work. Indeed, even people who were in the same city at the time were ready to believe that an earthquake accompanied his death, reminding us of the absurd miracles surrounding the death of Jesus recounted without a blush in Matthew 27:51-54. How easy it was for such stories to be believed! Even if this tale is filled with rhetoric on the part of Lucian, his criticism of gullibility would have no weight if it did not ring true.\nPeregrinus also had a small cult following after his death. His staff was treated as a religious relic (Lucian, The Ignorant Book Collector 14), his disciples preached his doctrine (Lucian, Runaways), and his statue healed the sick and gave oracles (Athenagoras, cited above). But his bid for religious glory was not as successful as another man, Alexander of Abonuteichos. Lucian dedicates an even longer and more vicious account of his personal contacts with this man, whom he calls \"the quack prophet.\" The account alone is detailed and entertaining, but for our present purpose it illustrates how easy it was to invent a god and watch the masses scurry to worship it. His scam began around 150 A.D. and lasted well beyond his death in 170 A.D., drawing the patronage of emperors and provincial governors as well as the commons. His cult may have even lasted into the 4th century, although the evidence is unclear.\nThe official story was that a snake-god with a human head was born as an incarnation of Asclepius, and Alexander was his keeper and intermediary. With this arrangement Alexander gave oracles, offered intercessory prayers, and even began his own mystery religion. Lucian tells us the inside story. Glycon was in fact a trained snake with a puppet head, and all the miracles surrounding him were either tall tales or the ingenious tricks of Alexander himself. But what might we think had there been no Lucian to tell us this? So credulous was the public as well as the government, that a petition to change the name of the town where the god lived, and to strike a special coin in his honor (Lucian, Alexander 58), was heeded, and we have direct confirmation of both facts: such coins have been found, dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius and continuing up into the 3rd century, bearing the unique image of a human-headed snake god. Likewise, the town of Abonuteichos was petitioned to be renamed Ionopolis, and the town is today known as Ineboli, a clear derivation. Even statues, inscriptions, and other carvings survive, attesting to this Alexander and his god Glycon and their ensuing cult (Culture and Society in Lucian, pp. 138, 143).\nAs for his influence, Lucian tells us that Severianus, the governor of Cappadocia, was killed in Armenia because he believed an oracle of Alexander's (27), and Rutilianus, the governor of Moesia and Asia, was also a devout follower, and even married Alexander's daughter. Indeed, Alexander's \"god\" was so popular that people rushed all the way from Rome to consult him (30), and even the emperor Marcus Aurelius sought his prophecy (48). From this it is all the more apparent that religious crazes were a dime a dozen in the time and place of the Gospels, helping to explain why a new and strange religion like Christianity could become so popular, and its claims--which to us sound absurd--could be so readily believed.\nThe final lesson from the case of Alexander and Peregrinus is that Lucian's skeptical debunking never persuaded any believers, showing that even the rare skeptic, no matter how convincing his arguments and evidence, could have no practical effect on the credulous. The vast majority would never read or hear anything he wrote, and most of those who did would dismiss it. Indeed, believers were hostile to critical thought and would shout the skeptics down and drive off even suspected doubters in their midst, as actually happened in the case of Alexander: before every ceremony, the congregation would cry \"Away with the Epicureans! Away with the Christians!\" (and atheists and unbelievers in general: 38) since these two groups had a reputation for trying to debunk popular religion (this hostility could even come to slander and violence: 25). In effect, this was like clamping their hands over their ears and humming, deliberately refusing even to hear reasonable arguments, much less to consider their force.\nFrom all of this one thing should be apparent: the age of Jesus was not an age of critical reflection and remarkable religious acumen. It was an era filled with con artists, gullible believers, martyrs without a cause, and reputed miracles of every variety. In light of this picture, the tales of the Gospels do not seem very remarkable. Even if they were false in every detail, there is no evidence that they would have been disbelieved or rejected as absurd by many people, who at the time had little in the way of education or critical thinking skills. They had no newspapers, telephones, photographs, or public documents to consult to check a story. If they were not a witness, all they had was a man's word. And even if they were a witness, the tales above tell us that even then their skills of critical reflection were lacking. Certainly, this age did not lack keen and educated skeptics--it is not that there were no skilled and skeptical observers. There were. Rather, the shouts of the credulous rabble overpowered their voice and seized the world from them, boldly leading them all into the darkness of a thousand years of chaos. Perhaps we should not repeat the same mistake. After all, the wise learn from history. The fool ignores it.\nGlenn Miller has written a rebuttal to this essay (\"Were the Miracles of Jesus invented by the Disciples/Evangelists?\" 2002), in response to which I changed some of the language above so as not to give a mistaken impression of my meaning. Miller's title has little to do with my essay, since I am not arguing here (even if I do elsewhere) that anyone in particular \"invented\" the miracles of Jesus. Rather, I am merely presenting a survey of the social and intellectual context in which those miracles came to be believed.\nAs to the remainder of Miller's criticism of this essay specifically, I plan to respond in a future rebuttal (which will be announced here). But one simple point must be made even now: almost all of Miller's relevant evidence comes from the educated or even scholarly elite (like Lucian), and thus in no way represents the average man or woman in antiquity, who by their very circumstance wrote nothing for Miller to examine. I would guess that skilled skeptics and skeptical viewpoints like those Miller finds probably could not be found in much more than 10% of the population of the time, if even that--but whose existence I acknowledged even in the original draft of this essay.\nThe fact that pagan miracle working is not much heard of today is in large part due to the more effective Christian propaganda during the Empire and, of course, a thousand years of censorship afterward. An excellent discussion of the former, and how it contributed to the eventual success of the Church, is given by Thomas Matthews in The Clash of the Gods: A Reinterpretation of Christian Art (1993). For a broad comparative study of holy men of all faiths (Christian, pagan, and Jewish) in the time of Jesus, an excellent source is Sage, Saint, and Sophist: Holy Men and their Associates in the Early Roman Empire, by Graham Anderson (1994). Both are highly recommended.\nThe most extensive study on the historicity of Apollonius as well as his cult and legend can be found in the otherwise dry work by Maria Dzielska, Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, translated by Piotr Pienkowski (L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1986). Interested scholars should begin there. In particular, the source tradition on his magic \"talismans\" is a complicated affair, but their history and reluctant acceptance by the Church is discussed at great length by Dzielska in chapter 3. As for Lucian, his works about Peregrinus and Alexander are available in a very readable and engaging English translation in Lionel Casson's Selected Satires of Lucian (1962). These two stories are a very fun read, and well worth seeking out. An excellent survey and analysis of Lucian's works and his surrounding culture is available in Culture and Society in Lucian by C. P. Jones (1986). This is, in fact, a must-read for anyone interested in the contrast between free thought and gullibility in the Roman Empire. It has entire chapters dedicated to Peregrinus and Alexander. Finally, Lucian's Philopseudes (or \"Lover of Lies\") is a virtual treasure trove of examples of ancient credulity and superstition that is a must-read source on the subject (it can be found in vol. 3 of Lucian's works in the Loeb Classical Library).",

Sorry.\nI started a new RftG, and invited the people I think were interested. If I invited you by mistake, sorry, don't feel obligated to play, and if I missed you, double sorry. I hope this system is the next thing the admins decide to overhaul.\nI'll try the other failed ones again soon.\nNew game! Nippon is open for 3 others to join here. I've never played it before, but looking forward to learning.\nNote: We figured out recently that RftG will let you create a six-player game, but will not let the sixth player join if you don't have the final expansion loaded.\nThank you for the note, I booted you, and moved it down to 5 instead.\nYep. I didn't join the second tourney because I lost all but one of the matches that I played because of running out of time.\nI feel like the guy I was playing against was TRYING to make me run out of time, but it may have just been in my head.\nThere are absolutely people who do this.\nhttps://en.boardgamearena.com/#!table?table=36649836 - 1 person come play Hanabi with me!",

    "text": "When we hear the word patience, we probably think of the virtue that enables us to wait. That\u2019s one way of looking at it, but Spirit-led patience is also much more. Patience is longsuffering. It involves more than passive waiting; it is active forbearance. It is a deliberate willingness to put up with disagreeable things in pursuit of higher goals.\nThe best example of patience in the Bible is God himself. A number of times, God is described as being \u201cslow to anger\u201d (see Exodus 34:6; Psalm 103:8). This phrase captures what true patience is. Patient people do more than just wait. They actively restrain their rightful anger and frustration. For a higher purpose, they put up with things that they know are wrong.\nThis is the attitude our longsuffering God has toward sinful people. For Paul, the \u201cimmense patience\u201d of Jesus meant that God put up with all his wickedness for a long time before showing mercy to him. Paul calls himself \u201cthe worst of sinners,\u201d reflecting back on the time of his life when he persecuted Christians (see Acts 7:54-8:3). But God had other plans for Paul (Acts 9:1-31; 13:1-28:31). That could easily be the testimony of every believer.\nHow wonderful that God\u2019s love rests on his own capacity for goodness, and not our own!\nDear Lord, thank you for being patient with us. Forgive us for all we do wrong, and help us to be living testimonies of your mercy. In Jesus&rsquo; name, Amen.",

    "text": "According to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there has been a recent increase in food allergies among US children ages 18 and below. The data suggests that kid\u2019s food allergies have increased from 3.4% in 1997 to 5.1% by 2011. Skin allergies increased from 7.4 percent to 12.5 percent in that same time span.\nResults from the CDC survey indicate that African American children are more prone to skin allergies when compared to Caucasians. On the other hand, the latter have a higher risk of developing respiratory diseases. Children of Latin American descent have the smallest chances of developing skin reactions when compared to many other races.\nStudies also revealed that the income level of the family is an influential factor. Though there is no known cause for the correlation between income and allergies, researchers have speculated that differences in diet and frequency of antibiotic use could be factors. It is also possible that allergies are simply reported more frequently by affluent families who tend to visit the doctor more often.\nIn further findings, children ages 5 or less are more likely to develop skin allergies when compared to children over 5 years of age. Statistics also revealed that older children are more prone to respiratory problems.\nIn spite of this increase in children\u2019s allergies, there is hope. AllergyEasy offers sublingual immunotherapy for patients of all ages. This no-shots, no-hassle allergy solution treats symptoms with under-the-tongue drops. They are prescribed by a physician but can be taken at home because they have a higher safety profile than allergy shots. Contact AllergyEasy at (877) 276-3393 for more details.",

    "text": "This DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation) and after correction for difference in exposure conditions and between respiratory rates under standard conditions and under conditions of light activity (1/0.38 m3/kg x 7d/5d x 6.7 m3/10 m3).\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal) and after correction for difference in absorption and in exposure conditions (50%/5% x 7d/5d). The oral and dermal absorptions are estimated to be 50 and 5% respectively.\nOccupational exposure limits (8-h time weighted average) of 10 ppm (49 mg/m3) have been adopted in Austria and Germany (DFG) or of 25 ppm (125 mg/m3) in Belgium, Denmark and Great Britain. Short-term OEL of 10 ppm is in force in Austria, of 20 ppm in Germany (DFG) and of 25 ppm in Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden and UK.\n\u201cCarcinogenicity studies with hexylene glycol are not available. However, the genotoxicity studies provide no evidence of a carcinogenic potential. In animal studies of limited validity, 40 mg/kg body weight and day was found to be the NOEL for systemic toxicity after oral administration of the substance. The critical effect of hexylene glycol, however, is the eye irritation, which was observed in animals treated with the undiluted substance. Hexylene glycol does not seem to be a very powerful eye irritant as 25 % solutions were not irritating. In an early study, eye irritation developed in most of the 12 male and female test persons exposed for 15 minutes to hexylene glycol vapour in a concentration of 50 ppm (approximately equivalent to the saturation concentration at 25\u00b0C). No NOEL was determined in this study. The eye irritation seems not to have been very severe, a fact which is also suggested by the steepness of the dose-response curve seen in the Draize test data. The MAK value was established provisionally at 10 ml/m3. Because the eye irritation was not severe, for the restriction of exposure peaks hexylene glycol was classified in Peak limitation category I with an excursion factor of 2. Then, even during the permissible peak concentrations up to 20 ml/m3, no marked irritation is expected. Because of the lack of adequate data for the irritant potential of hexylene glycol, the MAK value must be considered provisional and requires confirmation in further studies. Assuming that 100 % of the inhaled substance is absorbed, exposure to concentrations in the range of the MAK value could result in a daily dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight which is still below the NOEL determined in animal studies with oral administration, assuming 100 % absorption here too. As there are no reproductive toxicity studies, hexylene glycol is listed in Section II of the List of MAK and BAT Values. The sensitizing potential is low and so the substance is not designated with an \"Sh\". The solubility of the substance suggests that it would be readily absorbed through the skin, but as the toxicity after repeated dermal application to experimental animals is low, the substance is not designated with an \"H\"\u201d.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation x 1/1.15 m3/kg). The absorption by inhalation is expected to be of the same order than the absorption by oral route.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal, x 50%/5%). The oral and dermal absorptions are estimated to be 50 and 5% respectively.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a).",

    "text": "1) The development of screw conveyor can be divided into two process, shaft type auger conveyor and shaftless type auger conveyor.\na. Shaft type auger conveyor consists of screw, U type trough, cover plate, inlet, outlet and drive device, which has three types of installation mode, horizontal, inclined and vertical mounting.\nb. Shaftless type auger conveyor uses shaftless spiral blade to replace screw, and U type trough is equipped with replaceable lining. The structure of shaftless type auger conveyor is simple, the material is fed into inlet and moving towards outlet by spiral blades. The whole conveying process is made in a fully closed trough.\n2) GX type auger conveyor is appeared in early phase of screw conveyor and is the earliest universal equipment in China. It mainly transports powdery, granular and small lumpy material, and is not suitable to convey perishable, viscous, easily caked and large chunks of material, because these material are easy to bond on the spiral blades, or block at the position of hanger bearing, which will cause inconvenience to the transportation process. The advantages of GX screw conveyor are energy-saving, low consumption, dust prevention, good sealing, low noise, well-adapted, easy operation and maintenance, flexible arrangement of the positions of inlet and outlet. The disadvantages are huge power consumption, quick wearing of conveyor parts, serious material crushing in the transportation process.\n3) LS type auger conveyor is new generation of screw conveyor, which is designed and improved on the basis of GX type auger conveyor. The advantages are novel structure, reliable performance, advanced technology, wide range of application, significant energy saving and consumption reducing.\n1) Large capacity, high speed and long service life.\n2) Low energy consumption. Most of the energy for screw conveyor is spent on abrasion.\n3) Intelligent development. The future auger conveyor should be closely connected with computer. It will be suitable for program control and intelligent operation. The material handling, equipment installation and maintenance should be intelligent management.\n4) Screw conveyor can be curved transportation.\n5) Combined, compound and large-scale transportation mode. Screw conveyors are co-used with various kinds of continuous conveying equipments to finish complicated material handling. Large-scale transportation includes large capacity, the length of single conveyor and high angle conveying, etc.\n6) To expand the scope of application. At present, the usage range of auger conveyor is restricted. The scope of application should be expanded, to design the auger conveyors that can be operated in corrosive, radioactive, flammable material environment in the condition of high and low temperatures, as well as the conveyors which can transport molten, explosive, easily coking and viscous materials.\n7) To design auger conveyor using environmental awareness, and reduce the pollution to achieve the goal of green design.\nPK Machinery is a professional manufacturer of vibrating screen, screw conveyor, belt conveyor, bucket elevator and scraper conveyor, further information, please click:www.pkmachinery.com.",

This has been fixed.\n\u2022A critical error in the system service has been fixed: In some cases the spam detection stopped working. This is no longer the case.\n\u2022A critical error in DNS-based spam tests (e.g. blacklists) that caused a drop in the spam detection rate has been fixed. All external blacklists are now queried again.\n\u2022SpamAssassin for Windows 3.4.1 (includes Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.1) has been integrated.\n\u2022Please note: Support for Windows XP and Server 2003 has been dropped.\n\u2022More than one IP address can be specified as a ListenIP in file SpamD.config.\n\u2022The service considers open connections to clients. Periodic restarts of the SpamAssassin daemon are delayed accordingly.\n\u2022Proxy settings are respected in all cases.\n\u2022Several minor improvements and minor fixes have been incorporated.\n\u2022For bayes and rules files SpamAssassin now uses the paths configured in the file \"path.config\" to access Bayes filter and rules files.\n\u2022SpamAssassin for Windows 3.4.0.30 (includes Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.0) has been integrated.\n\u2022The CPU load of the SpamAssassin daemon was reduced significantly. This was achieved by using a set of native compiled anti spam rules (\"Rule2XSBody\" plugin).\n\u2022A problem that caused the service to stop itself sometimes, has been solved.\n\u2022Under certain conditions a wrong scan date was shown in the spam report. This problem has been solved.\n\u2022The bayes files are no more persisted in the user profile but in the %programdata% directory instead.\n\u2022On certain systems, the service didn't start automatically with the system. This problem was solved.\n\u2022The maximum size of the service log file (Service.log) can now be specified in the Service.config.\n\u2022The integrated SpamAssassin was updated to version 3.4.0 (RC5).\n\u2022XML-based files can now be used for configuration instead of the Windows registry.\n\u2022The service can now be configured via the \"Service.config\" file. Please refer to the \"Configuration\" topic for more information.\n\u2022The SpamAssassin daemon is now configured separately via the \"SpamD.config\" file. Please refer to the \"Configuration\" topic for more information.\n\u2022The log file (SpamD.log) of the SpamAssassin daemon is no longer reset at each restart of the daemon but each day instead.\n\u2022In addition to the EventLog, each message from the service is now also written to a separate text file \"Service.log\" that is located in the application data directory.\n\u2022The setup now queries for a contact address for users whose mails were identified as false positives.\n\u2022A problem has been solved which could lead to a handle leak of the service.\n\u2022The firewall rules are now deleted when uninstalling the application.\n\u2022A new copy protection was integrated. Please note that old installation keys are no longer valid. You will find your new installation keys in the customer area.\n\u2022Numerous further improvements and a few minor bug fixes have been incorporated.\n\u2022The spam reports generated by SpamAssassin in a Box are now compatible to hMailServer.\n\u2022Mails that have been parsed by SpamAssassin are now correctly displayed in mail clients like Windows Live Mail.\n\u2022When starting up, the service now checks if the required ports for the Razor module are open.\n\u2022SpamAssassin for Windows 1.2.1 (contains Apache SpamAssassin 3.3.2) has been integrated.\n\u2022The service now adapts to the CPU usage: if this value is too high, the SpamAssassin daemon will not reboot.\n\u2022The automatic update of SpamAssassin rules has been improved.\n\u2022Setup will now add exceptions for SpamAssassin and SpamD at the Windows firewall.\n\u2022Improved the Windows Event Log functionality.\n\u2022First release of SpamAssassin in a Box.\n\u2022Based on SpamAssassin for Windows Version 1.1 (Apache SpamAssassin Version 3.3.1).\n\u2022Provides SpamAssassin as a Windows service that can easily be controlled via Windows Service Control Manager.\n\u2022Monitors the SpamAssassin daemon 'SpamD' for automatic restart in case of failure.\n\u2022Periodically updates the SpamAssassin anti-spam rules.\n\u2022Properly shuts down SpamD by sending a signal instead of killing the process (which can cause temporary files to be left on the system).\n\u2022To consider possible changes in SpamAssassin configuration and to prevent potential memory leaks, SpamAssassin in a Box periodically restarts the daemon.\n\u2022SpamAssassin default rules plus several additional anti-spam rules included.\n\u2022Fully configurable via the Windows registry.",

    "text": "CLEMSON, S.C. \u2014 Jaron Blossomgame scored a season-high 29 points to lead Clemson to a 93-65 victory over SC State on Tuesday, the Tigers\u2019 fifth straight win, all at home. Blossomgame moved into the top 20 in Clemson history in career scoring, surpassing 1,300 points. Clemson moved to 7-2 with the win, while SC State dropped to 2-8 overall. In all, the Tigers had four scorers in double figures, including Shelton Mitchell (14), Donte Grantham (13) and Avry Holmes (10). The Tigers had just two turnovers for the game, the second-lowest figure in program history. Clemson had 17 assists on 36 baskets and outscored the Bulldogs by a whopping 52-28 margin in the paint. Blossomgame provided early energy, going upstairs to land a couple of high-flying alleyoops. He posted 15 of his points before intermission, helping Clemson to a lead of as many as 13 in the opening frame. The Tigers saw SC State hang around, as the Bulldogs converted 50 percent of their field goal attempts in the opening 20 minutes of play. Clemson stretched its second-half advantage to 20 for the first time when Grantham emphatically followed a Holmes miss, throwing down a one-handed slam to bring the crowd to its feet. The Tigers take to the road against a pair of SEC foes, playing Alabama on Sunday, Dec. 18 in Birmingham, before facing rival South Carolina three days later in Columbia.\n\u201cThis was a really good offensive performance. Certainly, having 17 assists and only two turnovers were big stats, as well as the 23 offensive rebounds. We knew, especially when they played small, that we could hurt them inside.",

That\u2019s why Hallmark has created a back-to-school confidence checklist!\nLet them hold onto your words.

Challenge the entire family to support each other by passing around the encouragement bug \u2014 Hallmark\u2019s Bug \u2018Em. One person starts by filling Bug \u2018Em with treats, a coupon to do something nice (e.g., make their sibling\u2019s bed) or a kind note of encouragement, and then leaves Bug \u2018Em where the recipient will find it. Once the recipient finds Bug \u2018Em, he or she is charged with surprising another family member and spreading the encouragement bug.\nWe have done the homework for you and want to give you a jumpstart on the school year.\n*BONUS* Hallmark Recordable Storybook - Recordable Storybooks allow you to record your voice, and your little ones can read along with you even if you\u2019re far away. They are also great for encouraging your kids to read and building confidence for reading aloud!\nPrint your Quiznos coupons before they are gone!\nDecoding Coupon Barcodes - Is It Wrong?\nI was shopping in Harris Teeter yesterday and ran into an interesting situation. Because I am often recognized at the stores, people always ask me questions. I am more than happy to help. However, when I have to tell someone their doing something \"Wrong\" I feel bad. I had to deal with that yesterday.\nFirst of all, I was asked if there was a way to read the coupon bar code to see if they can use it on other products than what it was intended for. I answered \"No, I don't teach that practice\". Then I was informed that a customer in the store told them about it and was doing it regularly. I was a little upset about this. Practices like that is the reason stores are tightening up their coupon policies and making it harder for us to get great deals.\nSimply put, it is deciphering the bar code on a coupon to see if it will work on different (preferably less expensive) items.\nLook at coupon barcode decoding this way: It is like using counterfeit money to pay for your purchase! Although the cashier may not notice you are paying with a counterfeit bill, it will eventually reveal itself and the store looses out. A coupon is a form of payment and by not getting what the coupon says it is for is the same as paying with counterfeit money.\nSo, please read your coupons, get exactly what it says it is for and follow the parameters given by the coupon. Please don't use the barcode to determine what you can get because you know the register won't beep. Just because the register does not beep, does not mean that it is OK.\nThere are plenty of other websites and blogs that teach this practice and believe that it is OK. Please Be Aware! They believe they are right and have no problem teaching others to do the same. Taking advantage of a glitch in the bar code to get around the text of the coupon is fraud.",

The resort is about 5 minutes outside of downtown Puerto Vallarta.\nQ: What makes Dreams Villamagna such a great place for a destination wedding?\nA: We celebrate our weddings on a private beach area inside the property, so we can guarantee that couples will have a beachfront wedding without people crossing over in the way. Also, we only celebrate one wedding per day, so all our locations can be used by the couple (for example, if they want to do the ceremony on the beach, then cocktail hour in our terrace and reception on the garden).\nA: When a wedding can come together in person! It can be difficult to plan a wedding without seeing the areas and doing everything by email, so when a wedding is what the couples want; it is my favorite part.\nQ: What are the challenges brides face when planning their destination wedding at the resort?\nA: What time to end the event. Our outside events must ends at 10:00 pm. As a suggestion we offer to continue the party in our bar that closes at 12:30 am (not as a private event, as this bar is part of the all-inclusive) or to hold the event in our ballroom so it can run until 01:00 am. Extra-hours services may have additional costs.",

Our showroom is located at 3 Ubi Avenue 3, Crocodile House (rear lobby), #05-02B, Singapore 408857 (by appointment).\nSolid. But a spare rubber base at $9 is too costly.\nBought this for my Dad at the request from his OT. Excellent product especially when paired with the Sky Med Quad Cane Tip. With this the cane is able to stand on its own plus it gives extra grip to the floor too.",

    "text": "As summertime fun fades into memory and the world outside turns golden and nippy, consider taking a tour that will warm you from the inside out this fall. Whether you\u2019re thinking a bike ride for beer in the mountains of Washington or a mezcal excursion in Mexico, there are many options for you to have a tipple (or five) al fresco before winter hits. Here are seven delicious drinking tours across North America to celebrate the new season with a little bit of revelry.\n1. Experience history on the Urban Bourbon Trail in Kentucky.\nResponsible for 95 percent of the world\u2019s bourbon supply, Kentucky is Bourbon Country, and in Louisville, you\u2019ll be able to try the drink in all its forms at 44 bars and restaurants along the Urban Bourbon Trail. Established in 1999, this drinking experience is one for the books. Collect enough stamps on your official Urban Bourbon Trail passport and you\u2019ll receive a commemorative t-shirt.\n2. Sip beer at the beach in sunny South Florida.\nTrade fall leaves for palm trees this year and head to a seaside destination in South Florida to explore an emerging craft beer scene. Fort Lauderdale recently revealed the Ale Trail, a map of 47 breweries (and 500 beers) all located a short distance from the beach. With 300 choices at The Brass Tap Craft Beer Bar alone \u2014 and 200 beers from around the world at Old Hollywood Beerhouse \u2014 touring the pubs and beer gardens of the Fort Lauderdale Ale Trail will bring a range of fermented flavors, from horchata to Florida mango.\n3. Bike for beer in the Cascade Mountains in Washington.\nWork off your hops as you bike through the Cascade Mountains and enjoy local craft brews at the oldest continuously operated bar in Washington. The Pints & Bikes Tour at Suncadia Resort in northwestern Washington state is a five-mile journey through 6,000 acres of forest land with a pit stop at the Brick Tavern for a flight of local craft beer. Also known as the Brick Saloon, this legendary watering hole was established in 1889 and even has an original 23-foot running water spittoon and a basement jail cell.\n4. Try cider, beer, and cycling in Santa Fe.\nLearn about microbrews and ciders on the Brews Cruise, a 10- to 13-mile bicycle tour through the historic neighborhoods and scenic streets of Santa Fe. Along the way, you\u2019ll meet brewmasters and cider makers and get VIP tours of brewery backrooms. Bring your own bike for a discount on your tour.\n5. Explore Niagara Falls wine country.\nCombine a trip to Niagara Falls with a tasting tour of fine wines in a quiet countryside region. Book a Taste & See tour by Amore di Vino and choose which wineries, breweries, hard cider mills, or distilleries you want to visit. Or take the Discover Niagara shuttle to self-tour near the Niagara Wine Trail. The hop-on/hop-off trolley connects Niagara Falls to Old Fort Niagara. Purchase the Vino Visa Passport ($40) for steep discounts on local lodging, restaurants, and transportation.\n6. Do the Great Pumpkin Beer tour of North Carolina.\nWelcome the fall season Charlie Brown style and hop on the Port City Brew Bus for the Great Pumpkin Beer Tour of Wilmington. Along the way, you\u2019ll sample pumpkin beers and visit local breweries. Earn points through activities like a costume contest, Great Pumpkin trivia, pumpkin carving, and other challenges for the chance to win prizes on this perfect celebration of fall.\n7. Take a Mexican mezcal tour.\nChase the sun and get schooled on all things mezcal during a mezcal distillery tour in Oaxaca. Mezcal Educational Excursions of Oaxaca offers an up-close look at how mezcal is made, as well as the history of agave and culture of the palenqueros who produce mezcal, bringing participants to small, family-owned distilleries off the tourist path. During the tour, you\u2019ll witness both clay-pot distillation processes and the use of traditional copper stills, as well as get a chance to sample a number of mezcal variants.",

    "text": "Installed over 200+ 7450's with ip phones and cameras connected to switches. Currently we have several that are \"working\" sort of. Essentially POE is working great until I had to replace a camera the other day. Put new one up plugged in no POE, Tested with a Fluke Tester no POE, so I was like weird I guess I'll reboot the stack pull power and maybe that will fix it. Used CLI to check config on port 1/1/8 everything was good enabled and inline power. Still was not working and still not working to this day trying to figure out if there is a POE defect that needs to be updated to fix. It is all ports on the switch not just 2/1/6, 7 ,8. I unplugged a working device and then plugged back in and it would also not come back online with POE. We are using LLDP as well.\nHere is running config of stack with issue and poe details.\nThanks in advance for any help that anyone can give.\nI'm unclear on the steps you've taken so far. Did you try to disable and re-enable inline power on the port? When I've had inconsistent behavior with PoE ports, I'll disable the port, disable inline power to the port, re-enable the port, and re-enable inline power to the port. And usually that fixes the issue unless the hardware itself failed.\nAlso try another port that you know is working.\nAs mentioned above, show inline power would be helpful.\nYes to all of the above troubleshooting steps.\nPower Capacity: Total is 1496000 mWatts. Current Free is 1082046 mWatts.\nPower Capacity: Total is 1496000 mWatts. Current Free is 1158111 mWatts.\nAs for other troubleshooting steps we have reloaded the switch stack, pulled power from switches, moved to a working poe port and the port we move to also will not work even when plugging back in the old device that was currently working. The only thing I have not tried is to update the poe firmware to a newer version.\nAnd I asked tech support to get in touch, after I released your post from possible SPAM folder due to the length of your config. Case 794153 is your ticket with Ruckus. I'll keep this thread open if you don't mind sharing a 'show inline power' output please?\nIt seems like it is the first 8 ports but I can confirm plugging into port 10 >> on it would not power the device i get a link from my tester and no power though. resetting the switch usually fixes the issue but this time it didn't. Our current firmware does not allow that command to try it we would need to update our switches in this closet to test this. Thanks for the input Larry.\nI would strongly suggest taking a patch, there have been a few POE fixes since 8030h, 8030q is now available.\nHi, I faced same issue before. It was PoE firmware issue which you are using 01.6.7 Build 013.\nI solved it by upgrading 1.8.8.b001. You should upgrade boot code and FI image as well.",

Previously there has been relatively little growth in this space, but with Facebook pumping swathes of cash into developing their online advertising, improvements are being released more and more frequently.\nFacebook is becoming an increasingly friendly advertising platform for retailers and e-tailers. However, the latest update for Facebook ads links retailers\u2019 Facebook ads to their offline, in-store products.\nThis means that Facebook can show more relevant stock to more relevant customers with up-to-date prices and stock levels.\nFor example, say your Brisbane donut store has baked 50 donuts for today, 30 Vanilla Swirl and 20 Face Invaders \u2013 because everyone loves donuts right? After the lunch rush you update your stock levels using your stock management system to show that you only have 10 Vanilla Swirl and 5 Face Invaders left.\nGet into our Brisbane store quick! Only 5 Face Invader donuts left for today.\nDepending on your advertising campaign approach you could run a price discount using your dynamic Facebook ads.\nOnly 5 Face Invader donuts left in our Brisbane store. 50% off until sold out.\nThe beauty of the dynamic Facebook ads is that your advertising campaigns can be updated as frequently as you like to encourage more customers to convert, depending on what that means to your business. Once you\u2019ve defined what your marketing priorities are (and these will vary depending on the business), you can include these as calls to action (CTA) and include them in your Facebook ads.\nYou might want to encourage your prospects to call your business, visit your store, make a booking, or purchase online. These CTAs can be included in your dynamic Facebook ads.\nExtensions can be added that include: click-to-call links, location-based information, or links to landing pages with enquiry forms.\nCan Facebook Dynamic Ads Help My Business?\nGet in touch with us at Excite Media to discuss how Facebook ads can help your business.",

    "text": "(1) The scope of the individual services is based on the current service description in force at the time of placing the order.\n(2) If no other agreement has been expressly reached, the provider shall also be entitled to instruct expert staff or third parties to provide the services incumbent upon him. If active co-operation is required on the customer\u2019s part on another server, e.g. during the transfer of a web space package or other data stored on the provider\u2019s servers, the customer shall provide such co-operation in accordance with the provider\u2019s instructions and within the stipulated time.\n(3) If no other agreement has been reached the provider shall be entitled to demand payment in advance for all services ordered by the customer for the respective period.\nAll webhosting packages (\u201cvirtual servers\u201d) offered by the provider (Tomattos) assume a minimum service period of twelve months with an automatic extension of the agreement and the corresponding domains/servers for twelve months.\nAll server packages (dedicated servers, colocated servers, VPS, game servers) offered by the provider (Tomattos) assume a minimum service period selected by the customer when placing the order with an automatic extension of the contract and the corresponding domains/servers for the minium service period chosen by the customer.\n(4) Once the payment which had been made by the customer in advance for the agreed term has expired the contract is automatically terminated.\nThe domains associated with the packages/servers however, are charged for the complete contract period (this is dependent upon the domain extension and can be seen here) and must be terminated at least 4 weeks before expiry of the contract period in order to prevent automatic extension of the agreement (an extension is equivalent to renewed registration in respect of the contract period). If the package/server is terminated before the end of the contract for the relevant domain(s) or if the contract has not yet ended or has not yet been renewed, you will be charged separately to cover the remaining months of the domain service. The amount charged depends on the extension of the domain (for a complete list, please click here).\n(5) Given that the customer is placing the order as a private customer (as defined by \u00a7 13 BGB), the following applies: The customer has to pay the provider an appropriate fee which equals the the ratio of the services already rendered in relation to the total services intially intended for the contract, up to the point when the customer informed the provider about the enactment of his right of revocation regarding the contract. This is true in particular for yearly costs of ordering Internet domains. The reason for this is that these Internet domains are ordered individually according to the customer\u2019s wish from the responsible registry and such orders have to be paid by the provider for one year in advance. This is why advances rendered by the customer will be withheld, in general. Due to the installation and start of operation of the hosting services ordered by the customer (setup and configuration of the web space or server, the domain or the colocation space as well as the Internet uplink required, setup of upgrades, etc.), which the provider is contractually obligated to perform, the provider explicitly reserves the right to demand appropriate compensation for lost value if the costs for the services rendered by the provider in relation to the total services intended for the contract are not covered by advances made by the customer.\n(6) Should the provider be commissioned by the customer to provide services that are over and above the duties and responsibilities detailed in these General Terms and Conditions and in the service description (e.g. software-configuration, correction of errors or problems etc., that were not caused by the provider) the provider shall be entitled to demand adequate remuneration. In this case, a standard payment of \u20ac 25.00 per 15 minute unit of work shall be agreed. The provider may vary from this payment for the benefit of the customer as he sees fit.\n(7) The responsibility for backups of his data lies with the customer, not the provider.\n(8) The provider shall be entitled to to increase fees up to once per quarter. Such an increase requires the agreement of the customer. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks. As long as the main obligation, i.e. the obligation of payment of the basic usage-independent monthly remuneration, is not concerned, the provider determins the remuneration according to equitable discretion.\n(9) In case the value-added tax is increased, the provider shall be entitled to adjust the remuneration for goods and services, which are adduced or delivered within a continuing obligation, accordingly, starting at the point of time the value-added tax-change comes into effect.\n(10) It is agreed that payments made by the customer will not be refunded regardless of their original purpose \u2013 except in the case of an effective revocation, but then by inclusion of \u00a7 1(5). In case the customer made a payment higher than the amount of fees being required until the end of the contract and the fees for ordered services until then, it is agreed that the balance will not forfeit. Instead of a refund, the balance will be used for the provision of other / new services which the customer can order from the provider at any time.\n(1) The customer expressly assures that the provision and publication of web page content created either by himself and/or web pages created for him by the provider based on information provided by the customer neither infringes Bangladeshi law nor any other law applicable in the customer\u2019s country of residence, in particular copyright, data protection and competition law. The provider reserves the right to remove any pages from storage on his server that appear to be of dubious content. The provider shall immediately inform the supplier about any intended deletion of pages. The same shall apply if the provider is requested by third parties to change or delete contents of web pages because they allegedly violate third party rights.\n(2) The provider shall be entitled to delete any such web pages from hard disk storage on his web server if such pages are likely to infringe third party rights. He shall also be entitled to prevent access by third parties by taking any appropriate action. The provider undertakes to notify the customer immediately about any such measure. Should the customer be able to provide proof that there are no concerns regarding infringement of third party rights the provider shall make the web pages concerned available again to third parties. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from the content of materials on the customer\u2019s website(s).\n(3) The clauses 1 and 2 are also applicable for all other products offered by the provider which are suitable for publishing data, such as VPS or colocated servers.\n(1) Should domain registration or domain hosting form part of the services offered to the customer, the provider shall act only in the capacity of mediator between the customer, DENIC, InterNIC or other domain registration authority. Agreements with such organisations have the sole purpose of governing the customer\u2019s rights and obligations.\n(2) The provider has no influence on the delegation of domain names. He therefore cannot warrant that the registered domain names are not subject to claims by third parties or that they are unique or permanent. This also applies to sub-domains allocated within the provider\u2019s domain.\n(3) If the customer should be requested by a third party to surrender a domain because it may infringe third party rights, he shall inform the provider immediately. In such cases the provider shall be entitled to surrender the Internet domain on behalf of the customer. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from disputes regarding inadmissible use of domain names.\n(4) The customer hereby warrants to the provider that the address information (consisting of at least his name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) provided during registration or setting up a new account is correct and complete. Should this information change then the provider must be notified immediately in writing (letter, e-mail, fax). This and under certain conditions further information, will also be used for domains ordered by the customer from the provider.\n(1) If the provision of e-mail addresses or e-mail services forms part of the services offered by the provider, the limitations set out in \u00a7 3 shall apply analogously to e-mail addresses provided for the customer. The provider reserves the right to delete the customers e-mail messages if they are not retrieved from the mail server within 4 weeks of receipt.\n(2) If provision of access to public discussion forums (newsgroups) forms part of the services offered by the provider the time period over which public news is stored shall depend upon operational considerations of the provider.\n(3) The provider shall not be responsible for the e-mail addresses he provides; their use and management is outside the control of the provider. In the case of misuse, the provider shall be entitled to suspend all or individual e-mail addresses. The customer shall be informed immediately about such measures.\n(1) For webspace-packages, the following applies: The customer must ensure that his web site is designed such that the server is not excessively loaded, e.g. caused by CGI/PHP scripts requiring considerable computing power or above average memory usage. Excessive loading shall be defined as such usage of the aforementioned resources such that the operation of a Tomattos server is noticeably impaired or even crashes. Tomattos reserves the right to prohibit customers or third parties from accessing pages that do not comply with the aforementioned requirements.\n(3) For game servers, the following applies: Clan Servers will be supplied by the provider solely with password protection, so that players can only connect to them and participate in ongoing games after typing in a password. This password set by the provider may never be removed by the customer. Moreover, the password may never be completely or in part nor in any other way which will make it guessable or restorable be published in the server name or elsewhere. The password is to be kept secret by the customer and may only be passed on within his clan or a comparable community \u2013 to each player individually. The customer has to make sure that players who receive the password strictly adhere to this paragraph.\n(4) For game servers, the following applies: If the customer has ordered the upgrade \u201cTomattos branding\u201d for his game server, the name of the server will be extended by an advertisement supplied by the provider (e.g. \u2018by Tomattos.com\u2019). This extension by the provider may never \u2013 also not in part \u2013 be removed by the customer.\n(5) Should clause 1 to 4 be applicable, the provider reserves the right to immediately suspend the webspace package or server. This course of action will also be implemented should other sites stored on the server be affected by the customer\u2019s site. The customer shall be informed about any such suspension.\n(6) In case of such a suspension, solely the customer, not the provider shall be accountable for infringements of contracts. In any case the provider\u2019s claim of payment of remuneration remains, for the entire contract period.\n(1) The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on rented/colocated servers to the customer. Only the customer knows the individual administration-password of the server, not the provider. The provider is therefore unable to administrate the rented/colocated server. Hence the customer is solely and entirely responsible for administration and security of his servers, at his own expenses and risks. It is his duty to install necessary security-software and to inform himself constantly regarding security issues as well as to fix such by himself. Installation of maintenance software or other software does not absolve the customer from this duty.\n(2) Should customers receive fixed IP-addresses, the provider reserves the right to change these when technical needs arise and to inform the customer about his new IP-address.\n(3) If necessary and reasonable, the customer will assist at simple configuration changes, such as entering the login-data anew, or simple changes of his systems.\n(4) It is the customer\u2019s duty to configure his programs in such a way that they are restarted automatically when the hardware or the operating system is restarted.\n(5) For game servers, the following applies: The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on the rented game server to the customer, within the limits of the functional range of the web interface supplied by the provider. The customer, however, does not receive complete root or SSH access for the used game host server. The startup parameters of the game server cannot be changed by the customer.\n(1) The provider guarantees an annual mean 95%-availability of the physical connection of his webspace packages, dedicated, colocated, virtual servers and game servers. Exempted hereof are periods of time in which the servers are not reachable over the internet due to technical or other problems which do not lie within the provider\u2019s sphere of influence (force majeure, faults of third parties or of the customer).\n(2) The servers located in the datacenters of the provider are connected to the internet over a complex network infrastructure. Data traffic is routed over different active and passive network components (routers, switches, and other devices), which have a certain maximum data throughput. Therefore data throughput capacities can be limited for particular servers at particular points and not be equal to the maximum allowed data throughput of the respective switch-port. Unless otherwise agreed, the provider cannot give a guarantee for the amount of actually available bandwidth for individual servers, but makes available bandwidth depending on the technical capability of the datacenter, taking into account obligations towards other customers.\n(3) Customers can use the servers of the provider or own colocated servers for an manageable amount of different applications and use various software programms to this purpose, at their own discretion. Because of this, millions of different configurations are possible. The sheer diversity of these option does not permit the provider to give guarantees for the utilizability and compatibility of servers for a certain purpose.\nExcept for the specifications made in the description of the offer, the provider cannot give guarantees for the actual resources available for individual webspace packages, VPS and game servers. Rather, the provider makes available resouces depending on technical possibilities, taking into account obligations towards other customers.\n(1) The customer agrees that his personal data (basic data) and other information concerning use of the service (e.g. time, number and duration of connections, access passwords, uploads and downloads) may be stored by the provider during the period of the agreement should this be necessary for fulfilling the purpose of the contract, particularly for invoicing. The customer agrees to the storage of data. The provider may also processes and utilise such personal data that has been collected for the purpose of advising his customers, for advertising and market research for his own purposes and for structuring his telecommunication services in accordance with requirements. The customer shall be entitled to object to such use of his personal data.\n(2) Upon request by the customer the provider undertakes at any time and at no charge to provide full access to stored personal data pertaining to the customer. The provider shall not disclose this data or any of the customer\u2019s personal messages to third parties unless he is legally required to do so, in particular to government bodies or should this be required by internationally recognised technical standards.\n(3) The provider expressly points out that the protection of data privacy for data transmission across open networks such as the Internet cannot be fully guaranteed with current technology. The customer acknowledges and accepts that the provider is entitled at any time to view the websites stored on his server and, under certain conditions, any of the customer\u2019s data stored there if technical requirements so dictate. Other unauthorised Internet users may also be technically able to interfere with network security and control the flow of messages.\nThe customer warrants that all information he has given to Tomattos is correct and complete. Upon request the customer agrees to immediately inform Tomattos of any changes and to reconfirm that the data is currently correct within 7 days of receiving any such request.\n\u2013 and if the customer provides his own name server, the IP addresses of the primary and secondary name servers including the names of these servers.\n(4) The clauses in \u00a7 8 do not affect \u00a7 16(4).\nThe provider shall be liable for any damages caused by him or factors, servants and assignees through gross negligence or intent. In cases of violation of essential contractual obligations and slight negligence which lead to financial losses liability shall be limited to a liability insurance procured by the provider (with regard to the amount of liability) and to predictable, imminent losses (with regard to the type of liability).The limitations of liability stated above do not concern claims of the customer regarding product liability and especially do not apply for damage caused to the customer\u2019s health (or loss of life) attributable to the provider. Otherwise, liability is excluded.\nThe customer indemnifies the provider against all possible third party claims arising from any illegal action by the customer or from errors in the information provided by the latter. This applies in particular to copyright, data protection and competition law violations. Tomattos shall not be obliged to check the customer\u2019s websites for possible legal violations.\n(1) Applicable law is that of the The Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.\n(2) Any dispute resulting from this agreement shall be referred solely to a court of competent jurisdiction at the place of business of the provider.\n(2) In the case of incorrect direct debits/credit card debits (possibly caused by an overdrawn account, incorrect account data etc.) additional bank charges and increased administrative costs will arise for the provider. The provider will therefore charge a flat fee of \u20ac 15.00 for an incorrect direct debit and a flat fee of \u20ac 30.00 for an incorrect credit card debit.\n(3) In the case of a failed debit collection, the provider may immediately claim default interest fixed by law. Additionally, the provider shall be entitled to discontinue the service contract until payment is made. The provider shall be entitled to suspend the contract and reallocate the rented capacities. Data loss cannot be ruled out in this case. A one-time-fee of \u20ac 30.00 is computed by the provider when re-activating the service for the customer.\nIn the case of a non-payment until the second date mentioned in the demand note an additional fee of \u20ac 58.00 is computed for mandating a lawyer.\n(4) The provisions set out in paragraph 3 shall also apply in the case of non-payment if the customer has selected the payment option \u201cbank transfer\u201d, \u201cPayPal\u201d, \u201cSkrill\u201d, \u201cWestern Union\u201d or a similar, comparable payment option. Delay of payment is the case when, at the first of a given month, the services of the provider have not been prepaid for the entire month.\n(5) In case of NGO/NPO offers there is no refund or credit back. Any claim of such refubd or credit back will be not entertained. In additional lawyer charges may applicable in case of any legal procedure needed to perform.\n(6) In case of custom quoted servers, the non-refund and no credit back will applicable too.\n(7) Payment Policy Page terms will be also applicable except special cases.\nThe customer thus agrees to comply with the corresponding provisions and is responsible for observing them correctly.\nThese provisions may result in only having restricted or even not having the possibility to use otherwise purchased licenses of the customer with the servers of the provider. The provider will supply a license for all customer orders of Microsoft software products considering the Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement. This license allows the monthly use of the Microsoft software product on the server and limits its utilization permission with regard to some aspects. The customer particularly must not use Microsoft products which require additional or other licenses according to SPUR. The customer is obligated to comply with all these provisions on his own and is liable for violations against this usage policy to the provider and Microsoft.\n(1) The provider is obliged to enable a connection to the internet and a storing position for the server according to the respective product description.\n(2) The provider does not provide any guarantee for hardware damage which can result, for example, from transport to the datacenter, back to the customer or during going concern.\n(3) The provider grants the customer access to his server-system during the office-times published on the homepage of the provider in order to allow the customer to work on the server-system. This requires, however, a written request which has to be addressed to the support-department of the provider, at least 48 hours in advance. To access the server-system, the ID Card of the customer or a statement of authority signed by the customer is necessary. During the customer\u2019s presence in the datacenter, the provider has to fulfill various duties of supervision and control. Since this requires the attendance of the provider\u2019s personnel, costs of \u20ac 50.00 per started hour incur. With prior agreement, the provider can abstain from this at his sole discretion. If the appointment is not kept, the customer has to cancel it at least 2 hours in advance (if during office hours) or at least 12 hours in advance (if outside of office hours). If there is no cancellation within the stated time periods and the appointment is not kept, the customer will be billed for \u20ac 30.00.\n(4) Reboots are provided for free by the provider at the customer\u2019s request unless stated otherwise in the product description and unless the amount of reboots per month does not create disproportional effort.\n(5) Other technical support services are not included with the offer. If the help of a technician is required, costs of \u20ac 25.00 per started 15 minutes incur.\n\u2013 In case of an outage / non-availability of electricity, UPS or air conditioning, the provider will immediately, at the latest during the next working day, undertake all measures necessary to restore going concern.\n(7) Claims resulting from operational outage of peripherals (air conditioning, electricity) can only be asserted in case of violation of the guarantees mentioned in clause 6 up to the monthly amount for the colocated server and only if the outage has been lasting for over 72 hours (continuously, without breaks). If financial losses are claimed, these have to be substantiated and will be redeemed after verification up to an amout of \u20ac 500.00.\nIn case of an bandwidth-outage such claims are only valid if the guarantees regarding bandwidth made in \u00a7 7 clause 1 are undercut.\n(8) The provider does not assume liability for damage or loss of data.\n(9) The customer is responsible that the colocated equipment is flawless so that no negative impact for other devices can emanate from it.\n(10) The customer is liable for possible damages emanating from the server and is responsible for an adequate insurance.\n(11) If the provider informs the customer immediately, at least one month in advance, that he has decided to move to a different location, each party has a special cancellation right and can cancel the performances specified in this contract that are provided in the location which will change using written form. The cancellation will come into effect on the day the location is about to change. Given that the provider has informed the customer accordingly and neither party has made use of their special cancellation right, the contract continues unchanged at the new location. This clause does not come into effect if the reason for the change of the location is an instant dismissal of the rental agreement between the provider and his lessor. In this case, only clause 12 applies.\n(12) The customer is aware of the fact that the provider himself has to rent the datafloor. If this contract concerns the housing and bandwidth provided in the datacenter, the contract concerning this performance ends automatically at the point of time when the rental agreement between the provider and his lessor ends by means of an instant dismissal and the provider has been unable to find a suitable new location. The provider will inform the customer immediately. Other agreements remain untouched.\n(13) If the server of the customer needs more electricity or space than specified in the rented offer, additional housing-modules need to be rented \u2013 when only noticed later, this change will be retroactive. The number and price of the required additional modules is specified on the homepage of the provider.\n\u2013 The customer is informed immediately about such a change.\n\u2013 The customer has a special cancellation right for bandwidth and housing in the affected datacenter: He can cancel affected subscriptions within three months upon receipt of the message informing him about the change. This special cancellation right is valid during the mentioned three months-period. If it is not used, the contract continues under the adjusted conditions.\n(15) The customer agrees to the fact that the provider opens the case of the colocated server and adds a \u2018Web Resetter\u2019 to the reset-pin of the mainboard. Using this device, the provider is able to restart the server of the customer at any time if the customer requests it. Furthermore, the customer is able to reboot the server himself using the aforementioned device if he orders the necessary upgrade. In case the server is returned to the customer, the provider will remove the \u2018Web Resetter\u2019 again.\n(16) The customer is aware of and agrees to the fact that the provider publishes (Live-)video material and static pictures of his datacenter and that these videos/images might picture equipment or servers of the customer.\n(17) If the customer is in delay of payment for any performance between him and the provider, the provider has the right to keep the server and/or equipment of the customer in his posession until payment is made in full.\n(18) The customer grants the provider a lien on colocated servers and other equipment to back claims resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer. The lien only expires once all debt resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer has been paid and the contract has ended. Starting with the inception of treaty, the customer has to inform the provider immediately should the server not be or cease to be his property, be pledged or assigned. If the customer is entitled to other rights to the colocated server, especially expectant right, he assigns these to the provider in order to back debts resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer.\n(19) The lien and the contractual lien can also be asserted for claims resulting from former services or other claims.\n(20) If the provider excercises his lien, it shall suffice to send a written notice to the last known address of the customer. No further notice is required.\n(21) Legal liens are unaffected by these terms.\n(22) If the customer does not retrieve his server / other equipment within four weeks after the contract has ended, the provider will stock the items for a fee of \u20ac 10 per item and per month.\nThe provider has the right to change the subject terms of this contract as long as the changes are reasonable, taking into account the interests of the provider. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks.n.\n(1) Amendments or additions to this contract are only valid if they have been agreed to in writing. This also applies to any amendment of this clause relating to written notification.\n(2) All communications by the provider may be sent to the customer by electronic means. This also applies to invoices sent for services provided under the agreement.\n(3) The customer may only set off claims against the provider if such claims are established as undisputed or legally binding.\n(4) The provider is authorised to list the customer as a reference-customer without being obliged to pay a refund.\n(5) All prices quoted are not binding unless they are confirmed contractually. Errors and omissions in our prices excepted.\n(6) If any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or becomes invalid or if there are omissions in the agreement that require rectification, the remaining provisions of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision or omission shall be replaced by a provision which comes closest to the intention of both parties as would have been agreed by the parties had they knowledge of such issues in advance.",

The top 15 designs will be which will be presented to the City Commission for possible adoption as our official city flag. Voting is open until Sept 23rd at 5pm.\nHaving a city flag is important for several reasons, but most importantly a well-designed flag can become a graphic that unites us as a community. My design was inspired by our agriculture (wheat symbol), tech-industry (the wheat symbol has bold, modern lines), and cold winters (blue for the glacier that once covered Fargo, and lighter blue for the snow and ice every winter).\n1. Keep it Simple The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.\n2. Use Meaningful Symbolism The flag\u2019s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.\n3. Use 2-3 Basic Colors Limit the number of colors on the flag to three, which contrast well and come from the standard color set.\n4. No Lettering or Seals Never use writing of any kind or an organization\u2019s seal.\n5. Be Distinctive or Be Related Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.\nThis entry was written by Shane, posted on September 7, 2015 at 2:33 pm, filed under graphic design and tagged fargo, fargo flag, vexillology.

Being charged with a DUI is just the beginning of a long and traumatic process. Your best chances of getting a good outcome or even a DUI dismissal is to retain a good DUI lawyer in Arizona. They will be able to determine what defense strategies may be used in your case.\nWere you charged with a DUI based on one breath test result?\nVirtually all experts concede that one breath test alone is unreliable. Breath testing is subject to various inaccuracies, including a variance as much as +/- 10.0%. This could be increased due to other factors. Therefore, two breath tests must be conducted.\nThere are many DUI defense strategies that can be used to argue your AZ DUI case against the State and prosecution. This defense is just one of many involves breath testing. Below is an excerpt from the book \u201c101 DUI Defenses 101 DEFENSES TO BEAT YOUR ARIZONA DUI \u00a9\u201d written by James Novak, Arizona DUI and Criminal Defense Attorney. For more DUI defenses, the abridged version of this E-book can be downloaded free by visiting www.arizonacriminaldefenseattorney.com.\nArizona has earned the reputation for being one of the toughest states on DUI charges in the country. The DUI laws are strict and penalties severe. If charged or arrested for an Arizona DUI, you should contact an Arizona DUI Lawyer as soon as possible. Even for first time offenders, the penalties are designed to \u201cteach a lesson\u201d so that the defendant will avoid a repeat offense and to get the word out, that Arizona has zero tolerance for those driving \u201cimpaired to the slightest degree\u201d or who may be drunk driving in Arizona due to alcohol or drugs.\nPenalties for convictions of first time, misdemeanor DUI in Arizona, depending on the circumstances may include mandatory jail time, suspension of driver\u2019s license, fines, fees, probation, mandatory counseling, and court ordered interlock devices on your vehicle to be installed at your expense.\nArizona Felony DUI or Aggravated DUI, charges can include lengthy prison terms, suspension of driver\u2019s license, exorbitant fines, fees, probation, mandatory counseling at your cost, and court ordered interlock devices on your vehicle to be installed at your expense. The Arizona Courts are especially harsh on repeat offenders and Arizona penalties reflect this.\nMany people make the common mistake of trying to seek counsel of a friend regarding their DUI who is not a licensed Arizona DUI or criminal Defense Attorney in Arizona. Resist this temptation. They are not walking in your shoes. They were not arrested. They will rarely know the Arizona DUI laws inside and out, current legislation, changing laws, defense strategies, and be experienced in defending cases in the Arizona criminal justice system. They will not bear the consequences of your DUI charges if they are not properly defended by a qualified DUI lawyer in Arizona.\nAfter an arrest for drunk driving, or DUI with drugs or medication, you should consult an attorney as soon as possible, to discuss your charges and defense options. Be sure that the Arizona DUI lawyer is experienced and defends cases often in the jurisdiction or city where you were arrested and received formal DUI charges or criminal charges. For example if you were arrested in Mesa Arizona, by Mesa Police, but you reside in Phoenix AZ, your DUI charges will be filed in Mesa Arizona, and your case will be heard through the Mesa AZ City Court. Make sure your DUI attorney defends DUI or criminal charges frequently in Mesa Arizona. It will benefit your defense if your DUI Lawyer is familiar with the court system, prosecution, and judges to hear DUI cases on a daily basis in Mesa AZ through the criminal justice system.\nThe best Arizona DUI lawyers begin defending your case with the thought process of building defense strategies that will lead to getting your Arizona DUI dismissed. That is where a good Arizona DUI Defense Attorney starts. They will base their decisions on how and what defenses to utilize based on the individual circumstances surrounding your case. Top DUI defense Attorneys in Arizona will know when and how to present their compelling arguments in your favor to get your charges dismissed. Depending on the strength and/or weakness of the prosecutions case, your AZ DUI attorney will examine the evidence, to determine if any evidence can justifiably be suppressed (not used against you). If the charges can not be dismissed, they will then attempt to negotiate with the prosecution a way of getting the charges reduced to a lesser charge, for example: a criminal charge down to a non-criminal charge, a felony to a misdemeanor, an extreme DUI to a non-extreme DUI and reduce the DUI penalties against you. In other words, in absence of being able to get the Arizona DUI charges dropped, a good AZ DUI defense attorney will make every effort to get the best possible outcome in your case.\nIf you are stopped by police for Arizona DUI, generally the police officer will use a set of five-to-six common tests called Field Sobriety Tests (FST). One thing that top Arizona Criminal Defense and DUI attorneys agree on is that so many aspects of the FST can be challenged on behalf of your defense, in an effort to get your case dismissed or charges reduced.\nTool o determine if further breath or blood tests are needed. Then they will later use your performance of these tests against you. They will make it sound like you did poorly on the tests. But in fact, even a person unimpaired by drugs or alcohol may perform these tests to a \u201cpoor\u201d standard. That is why they are often challenged.\nWAS YOU BATTERY OF FST CONDUCTED WITH CLIMATE, ENVORNMENTA OR LANDSCAPING DISADVANTAGES TO YOU?\nThe roadside could be uneven and covered by debris. The climate conditions could cause inability to perform the tests well. Were you doing the tests a surface on a hill, or a surface that contained mud, rocks, melting tar or oil, ice, snow drifts or other rough or other unsmooth or level surface? NHTSA requires that the Walk and Turn & the One Leg Stand be performed on a smooth, level surface.\nDid the officer report that you failed or did poorly on the HGN test?\nThis is the \u201cfollow the pen with your eyes test\u201d actually has a very complicated name- the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test. This test is allegedly meant to measures the involuntary jerking of the eye when a person is impaired by alcohol. When medical doctors conduct this test they do so in an areas with good lighting, employing medical equipment that holds the patient\u2019s head still and clearly lists the angles. The officer, for one test, must determine whether he detects the onset of nystagmus prior to 45%. It is almost impossible without be accurate on the angle. The test can be challenged as invalid under almost all roadside and lighting conditions.\nDid the breath test operator possess a valid, unexpired operator\u2019s license?\nIf not, the DUI breath test result is inadmissible.\nWas your blood sample preserved properly?\nThe preservation process can be an issue. The blood vials must have been stored properly prior to its use. The blood vials must not be used beyond the expiration date. The blood vials must be preserved in order to provide your defense attorney with the opportunity to test the sample with an independent lab for purposes of objectivity in your defense.\nWas the blood kit and contents in the kit, within the expiration date period? Was it properly sealed, packed, inspected, and maintained at the required temperature? When the police take your blood they usually do so using a pre-packed blood kit. However, safekeeping and inspection of the kits must be routinely performed to ensure that tubes have not expired, are sealed properly and are kept in an appropriate place that is not temperature extreme like the trunk of the car in the summer heat of Arizona.\nWas your urine sample properly tested?\nThe urine taken for drug testing must also be properly tested according to required testing procedures and protocol, for timing, specimen handling, transport, labeling, and preservation, including the containers for which the urine specimen is stored.\nWas your blood drawn within three hours of consuming your last alcoholic beverage?\nIt can take up to three hours for alcohol to be absorbed in your blood stream. If the blood draw was outside of the three hour window, the results of the BAC may be challenged as invalid.\nThese are just a few aspects of items that can be challenged to your favor if you have received Arizona DUI charges. That is why it is important to hire an Arizona DUI attorney who defends cases in the jurisdiction for which you were charged with the AZ DUI, and challenges such issues on a daily basis. It takes experience, special skills, training, knowledge and a great amount of defense litigation experience to challenge these issues in your defense. The ultimate goal of your AZ DUI Attorney is to examine some of these issues to pave the way for flaws in the prosecutions case for total dismissal, or in the alternative reduction of charges, suppression of evidence, and getting the best outcome in your case.\nA Mesa \u201cFelony DUI\u201d is also known as \u201cAggravated DUI\u201d. If you\u2019ve been arrested or face Felony DUI (Driving under the Influence) charges in Mesa, AZ the best advice you can get now is to consult a good Arizona Criminal Defense Attorney or Felony DUI Defense Attorney who defends cases frequently in Mesa Municipal Court. All DUI charges are serious. But Felony DUI convictions are even more serious, and can have long lasting adverse impacts that follow you for life.\n\u2022\tDUI charges involving an auto accident that results in bodily injury or significant harm to another person.\n\u2022\tDUI manslaughter \u2013 When the DUI and Auto accident results in a fatality of another person.\n\u2022\tDriving impaired under the influence of alcohol or drug, with a minor, in Arizona (that is age 15 or under) in the vehicle.\n\u2022\tFour months in Jail or Prison, if you have no prior criminal record or felony convictions. If serious injury or a fatality has occurred, this sentencing will be significantly harsher for a felony DUI conviction.\n\u2022\tCourt ordered Ignition Interlock Device added to your vehicle at your expense.\nDUI and Felony DUI laws are constantly changing. Because the laws and penalties are constantly changing, it is important to hire an experienced, highly qualified Arizona Criminal or AZ DUI defense Lawyer who defends DUI charges often in Mesa Municipal Court.

The integration of ICT in teaching and learning, as well as its support to participatory practices, is defined as a wicked problem that can be best approached through the adoption of a design mindset. In this regard, this symposium presents 4 papers that explore ways to use design thinking and ICT in three different levels: (1) education policy-making, (2) facilitating participation in education (3) design of tools and methods that foster reflection about teaching and learning. The four papers presented in the symposium can be considered as use cases in which design thinking has been used to develop new services, tools and practices.",

    "text": "\u2013 For building bridges from deterministic, linear and Cartesian thought and word use, by exploring our observations of the environments and their living systems affecting our ideals.\nA diverse work group of 6 to 20 people would be assembled, helped by a facilitator, needing about an hour to just go through the basic 3Step process. It\u2019s NOT a discussion group, of people offering opinions, but a learning group of people offering connecting observations. During the session they\u2019d need to be able to write as they talk, building on each other\u2019s observations, starting from being given or choosing an ideal goal to work with.\nThey\u2019d use that ideal to lead them on an exploration of what people in the group already know from observing their cultural, economic & ecological environments, sharing with each other things they\u2019ve seen are happening that could affect achieving the ideal. The product is a large collection of freshly shared observations on what\u2019s happening and how it connects; they\u2019d need to work with to proceed to planning for investments in changing their environment.\nTo work well in the UN\u2019s OWG setting, a few work groups might be organized in the same space, to work at the same time, each with their own facilitator. A prior process of facilitator training is needed, on now how to recognize environmental systems at work and ways of raising productive questions to help work groups fully explore what they know.\nFacilitators should have a combination of interests in human and natural economies, social science and natural science, some management and organizing experience. A facilitator\u2019s guide to the method and the systems science behind it is in preparation.\nIt\u2019s easy for people to talk about the ideals they\u2019d like to see in the world, and talk endlessly about them. Ideals don\u2019t tell you much about how to change the world to bring out your ideals, though. So I designed a very simple way to draw people into exploring the working parts of their own cultural & economic environments, that their ideals will need to work with, to help suggest practical interventions designed to \u201cwork with nature\u201d to bring out their ideals.\nI call it the 3Step process, and have been developing it in part prompted by Ambassador Korosi having showed some interest in my efforts to steer the OWG process toward studying what SDG\u2019s need to work with to succeed. People tend not to be drawn into thinking about how the complex connecting parts of their environments actually work together, though, being more comfortable just thinking and talking about how their own values and how their own mental environment works. But, if we have important ideals, that can only be achieved working with the world around us, that can draw people into learning how to turn their ideals (SDG goals) into practical ways to get involved (SDI interventions) to bring out their ideals in their real environment.\n3) Possible ways to intervene and bring out that ideal, working with those environments.\nNote: While others are talking try to both listen carefully and take quick notes on thoughts that come up as they speak. Ask the guide to suggest other things to look for if the flow of ideas lags. Don\u2019t be sidetracked to dwell on any one subject.\nDuring and after the discussion collect everyone\u2019s notes on a common note page, like a TitanPad, a chalk board, a Wiki etc., to solidify the rich variety of ideas discussed, understood as valuably interconnected starting points to think over in further study.\nThe process both brings people with different viewpoints together to see how useful the different things they\u2019re aware of about how their environments work can be when combined, and also to draw people into exploring just how much they already know themselves, freed to explore with interest what they\u2019ve observed about how things work, without preconception for how the information will be used.\nI tried using it in a Commons Cluster conference call a couple months ago. It worked splendidly to bring out lots of productive observations no one person could have collected. Some work on the method is still needed, to make it more of a real tool to use rather than just a cool way to bring up interesting new issues.\nIt\u2019s a scientifically designed method for bringing out what groups of people can see they\u2019ll need to work with in their environments to achieve their ideals. If developed as part of a process for designing real interventions to invest in for changing the environment, it will also help greatly expand the discussion general discussion of how to work with nature\u2019s working parts.\n3. Instead of the 3rd step, a period for discussing possible interventions at the end, you could have people take 5 minutes to work independently and write down one or two suggested intervention ideas to propose, in 20 words or less. Then to end the meeting each person could read theirs. That would end the meeting with a sort of \u201csurprise package\u201d of forward thinking, and help motivate people to contribute their notes to the wiki or public pad.\n4. for youth groups, after coming to a focus on some ideal they feel passionately about, you could make the environmental observations of Step 2 a guessing game, with each person getting a turn to think of and give hints to others trying to guess something they know of happening socially, economically, politically or ecologically that is important to take into account.\n5. somewhat like #1, you could have a 15min \u201cworld witness\u201d period just before coffee hour as a regular part of a church service. Some places it would be \u201ca crazy idea\u201d, other places not. The 3Steps approach is highly flexible and versatile, if you prepare a bit and get people to \u201cjust bear witness\u201d to what they can see happening that their ideals have to work with to get anywhere, expressing their awe of the natural world\u2019s movements and changes it is ours to deal with.\nGlad you\u2019re thinking about it. I\u2019ve been hoping to get feedback each time I offered the basic idea of the 3Step SDG design process, using our ideals for the \u201cworld we want\u201d to help us explore the real \u201cworld we have\u201d, to see what we have to work with. It\u2019s like going to \u201cdesign school\u201d, where the big task for an artist learning how to draw is first learning \u201chow to see\u201d. To change a particular environment, a designer needs to first learn to discover what\u2019s in the environment to work with, and like anything, it takes learning new habits.\nIt does help to have a vague idea what you\u2019re looking for, like the ideal statement of an SDG, but having any other preconception of what you\u2019re looking for will blind you to what\u2019s really there. As one instructor put it once, \u201cevery design should begin with reading book zero\u201d. It\u2019s usually the most important step in a design, and leads to getting the best kinds of results, just getting to know what there is to work with, in its own right.\nIn that way it\u2019s not so different from how anyone goes about designing a child\u2019s Halloween costume. There may be some vague image to begin with, but the real work begins with looking through the materials available, and then trying out this and that till you find a way to make something wonderful. I\u2019m sure you can think of lots of times where someone has only the vaguest idea of what they\u2019re planning on making until they\u2019ve rummaged through all the things that they might use.\nThat\u2019s the idea, anyway, to just get people to rummage through their cultural and economic environments, as if seeing and exploring them as if for the first time, learning about what they\u2019ll either have or need to work with to advance the ideal they want to design for. It\u2019s critically important to get the steps in the right order, and explore the materials of the environment you\u2019d need to work with before making a plan for what to do.\nIt\u2019s like going to \u201cdesign school\u201d, where the big task for an artist learning how to draw is first learning \u201chow to see\u201d. To change a particular environment, a designer needs to first learn to discover what\u2019s in the environment to work with, and like anything, it takes learning new habits.\nThis \u201clearning \u2018how to see'\u201d is the key issue for me in \u201ctransforming\u201d an old educational system that actual seems to close down that \u201copen-seeing\u201d to \u201cdiscarding\u201d any idea that isn\u2019t immediately familiar to one\u2019s already habituated \u201cways of seeing\u201d and some of the \u201cblinder prejudices\u201d (and some actually are indeed prejudices) that one has not learn well to easily \u201cexcavate\u201d and thus remain aware of, especially in understanding a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d environment.\nKey, so key to that is the ability to \u201clisten openly\u201d to those from that different environment and understand the world through their \u201cways of seeing\u201d and \u201chearing\u201d and more their analysis of the problem(s) to address. This is that critical \u201cdesign\u201d process step that is so key for me as an educator trying to train minds/eyes/ears and hearts to \u201csee\u201d in \u201cglobal\u201d more creative, right brain ways because otherwise too much of the non-linear, non-verbal communication is missed and thus the problem(s) itself poorly or only partly understood. This is that critical mis-step that I think too often sets us from the outside trying to help, for failure: you cannot really help solve problems you didn\u2019t really fully grasp.\nTrue \u201copen-mindedness\u201d in a reductionist, linearly, overly-rationally trained world or previous education system is to me the hardest and least understood of the skill-sets needed to do this. What I call the \u201cemotional/social and cultural intelligence skill sets\u201d that most \u201celitely-educated\u201d Westerners are negatively trained in, if at all (in worst cases creating unintended arrogance and ego-investment in \u201ctheir\u201d ideas over all others).\nThis is also a skill set that needs to be explicitly \u201cre-taught\u201d to combat this tendency. It is my \u201chardest\u201d work in trying to explain the underlying \u201ctransformative\u201d premise of the new educational model the TEF is supposed to represent, given that I and most of us involved in these issues at these levels were so \u201cwell-trained\u201d in the \u201cold\u201d more limiting frames.\nFor myself, I spent years \u201cre-learning\u201d this from the children I taught, so much more willing to teach me gently and because I could not at first \u201cunderstand\u201d why how I was taught to teach was actually \u201churting\u201d their learning and their hearts.\nThat was motivation enough to get me to understand why and why emotional intelligence and that necessary empathetic listening is so critical to all true learning.\nI\u2019m a natural systems scientist, that studies both how the organizations of nature develop and operate and also how they\u2019re perceived by popular and professional communities. Maybe the most profound thing I\u2019ve found is that \u201cpopular social culture trumps objective science\u201d just about everywhere. It seems to be because, for various reasons, \u201cscience doesn\u2019t work socially\u201d.\nWe need **something that works socially** for a human society to establish itself and be sustainable, a very basic social requirement seeming to stem from how human societies first developed. So\u2026. it\u2019s the social networks which end up being responsible for defining the foundations of our beliefs, and deciding what is meaningful to the society, creating our common reality and the nature of our experience of it.\nThe miracle is that all social networks more or less equally *experience* the natural world and how it works, but generally don\u2019t study it. As a result\u2026 we end up defining our shared ideas about reality without actually studying how the natural world works too. That social role in defining our cultural reality evidently holds true **even within the scientific and business communities**, as the basis for the many \u201csilos\u201d of exclusive knowledge that permit only their version of reality of the wider social agreement on the nature of the culture\u2019s common reality.\n\u2026\u2026 So to give social networks a better foundation on which to build our common \u201crealities\u201d I devised a neat trick. It\u2019s for getting them to look at what\u2019s happening in the natural world\u2019s, without any preconception as to \u201cwhat it\u2019s for\u201d.\nIt helps people notice how much they actually knew about how their world works but never put together before, and discover what they need to use and work with to get it to work for them, but may have never really asked before.",

    "text": "Addiction Step Eleven: Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.\nWhat is your understanding of God and how would you characterize your relationship with Him? I can open up any number of books and read about God, or read the Bible and not know anything about His nature and character. Through these steps, how has your perception of God changed? We have talked a lot about establishing a relationship with God, but how can you have any kind of a relationship with someone you don\u2019t talk to? Through prayer and meditation we improve our conscious contact with God.\nPrayer is simply talking to God. In Steps 4-7 we were honest with ourselves, and turned to God for His help. Working through the steps, that greater power we have relied on is not just a transcendent being, someone who is unreachable, unknowable and uninterested in our recovery. When we get to the point where we surrender and rely wholly on God, we are ready to move forward into Step 11.\nThis passage shows that the person\u2019s relationship with God is a daily undertaking, that he is completely surrendered to God\u2019s leading and knows that God is always with him. In Psalm 25:4-5, the writer is asking God to show him His way.\nTrusting in God, and not yourself, implies a close relationship and the surrender that opens us up to God\u2019s leading.\nThe Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book offers some insight into this interesting journey. \u201cIn thinking about our day we are faced with indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while. (page 86)\u201d As the relationship grows, through prayer and meditation, the wisdom of God is channeled back and what we used to think was a good guess or a good idea, becomes a regular occurrence. We are open to the leading of God.\n\u201cSo I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened\u201d (Luke 11:9-10).\nEven in our indecision, God knows our needs and is ready to help. Once you are learning to communicate daily with God you\u2019re ready for the twelve and final step of your journey: When you have complete Addiction Step Eleven go to Step 12.",

    "text": "If you\u2019re a fan of fantasy-themed games, you\u2019ll no doubt be very much enchanted by the Novomatic release, \u2018Secret Forest\u2019. It\u2019s full of fairy, elf and gnome magic, providing players with a transportation to another world. It\u2019s a little unfortunate that the interface is set up to include much of what would be considered a traditional slot machine cabinet, otherwise the developer could have had some fun with providing a foliage-based background and surroundings. However, this is not the biggest mishap with this game. Instead, they still haven\u2019t seen the error of their ways, and have seen fit to incorporate their tired old arcade noises into this every time the reels spin. Audio should be concentrated on as well as the visuals, and it just seems like Novomatic haven\u2019t really bothered thinking about it too much. However, with this nuance put aside, Secret Forest offers up an easy and relaxing game to play.\nThere are a total of five reels in this game, and these are accompanied by three rows, which presents a standard layout for frequent online video slots players. Upon these reels, various icons relating to the game\u2019s theme can be found, including a griffin, a blonde-haired fairy, a golden-horned unicorn, trees with faces, white-spotted toadstools, two gnomes and a regal castle. Furthermore, the addition of A, J, Q, K, 9 and 10 icons can also be seen. These icons are wonderfully animated and very intricately designed, providing a very visually appealing product.\nIn addition to these reels and rows, Novomatic have added a total of nine separate pay lines. All of these are able to be easily altered, ranging from a single one up to three, five, seven and the maximum of nine. Furthermore, the value of a single credit in the game can be changed between $0.50 and up to $1 and finally, $2. Also, players are also able to change around the bet placed per line, which will range from its minimum of one and increase up to the maximum of 100. Overall, players are able to place a maximum wager per round of $900.\nA large amount of features are usually added in to the best games, and while Secret Forest does have a few, it\u2019s not overwhelmed by them. Its specialities start off with its wild icon, and this is represented by the previously mentioned blonde-haired fairy. She will act as a substitute for all other icons on the reels, except for the scatters, and in doing so, will contribute towards providing a winning combination. Not only that, but she\u2019ll also double the pay out of any winnings.\nIn addition to this, you\u2019ll be able to see a scatter icon in view, which is represented by the trees with faces. Should you manage to spin three or more of these into any location on the reels, you\u2019ll be rewarded with 15 freespins. During this round, any pay outs will be tripled and freespins can be re-triggered as well.\nNovomatic have also added their regular gamble feature to the game, which provides all players with the opportunity to try and increase their winnings. It is triggered after every winning round during the main game, and will offer you up the possibility of playing a side game to do so. Should you choose to do this, you will be taken to a new screen. This will present you with a deck of playing cards, and you will need to guess the colour of the next playing card to be turned over. If you manage to do this correctly, you will see your winnings doubled. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t guess correctly, your winnings will be lost.\nThis game presents a wonderfully magical game, which is filled with visually pleasing animations and graphics. It\u2019s a shame about the previously noted music and interface, but gamers will be pleased to spend their time gazing upon intricately crafted symbols as they spin the reels.",

    "text": "Ron Kroichick July 21, 2016 Updated: July 21, 2016 7:54 p.m.\nCurry offered a half-amused glare in return. That one hurt.\nBarely a month after his team fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, completing a shocking collapse from a 3-1 series lead, Curry made a very public appearance. He played 18 holes with four amateur partners in advance of this year\u2019s American Century Championship, the celebrity golf tournament starting Friday alongside Lake Tahoe.\nCurry invited The Chronicle to tag along and chat occasionally as he walked the emerald-green fairways on a breathtakingly gorgeous day.\nThree things became clear: The Finals loss still haunts him; he worried about needing surgery on his troublesome knee and ankle; and he\u2019s confident the Warriors will blend recently signed free agent Kevin Durant into the lineup, after a brief transition.\n\u201cI think about it all the time,\u201d Curry said of the Finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating feeling to not get the job done. But at the end of the day, for us to kind of keep that in our memory bank as we go forward will make us better.\nCurry looked spry as he smacked long tee shots around Edgewood, a picturesque tree-lined course. No limping, no hesitation, no sign of lingering trouble in the wake of knee and ankle injuries during the playoffs.\nMake no mistake: Those injuries limited his mobility in the Finals. That was plain to see. Curry lacked his customary explosiveness, and the Cavaliers \u2014 most notably Irving, their dynamic point guard \u2014 took full advantage. Irving scored 26 points in Game 7, including a key late three-pointer over Curry.\nCaddie Bryant Barr and Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry talk things over during the 2016 American Century Celebrity-Amateur Tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, California, on Thurs. July 22, 2016. His caddie Bryant Barr, (right) was his roommate back in their college days at Davidson.\nTo his credit, Curry didn\u2019t use the injuries as an excuse. He didn\u2019t Thursday, either, but he acknowledged fearing he might need surgery after the Finals. That\u2019s the main reason he reluctantly skipped joining the U.S. Olympic team as it prepares for next month\u2019s Summer Games in Brazil.\nThursday\u2019s outing represented the first time Curry offered his take on Durant\u2019s rock-the-league decision to join the Warriors. Curry was part of the recruiting delegation to visit Durant in the Hamptons, hoping to persuade the sought-after free agent from Oklahoma City to sign with Golden State.\nGolden State Warriors' Stephen Curry signs autographs during the 2016 American Century Celebrity-Amateur Tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, California, on Thurs. July 22, 2016.\nA few days later, on the morning of July 4, Curry woke up on vacation in Hawaii to discover his phone lighting up. Durant had left a voice mail. Draymond Green and other teammates had sent text messages.\nBut the first text Curry opened was from Warriors owner Joe Lacob. Curry figured Lacob was offering consolation, but then he read the message and realized Durant was now his teammate.\nThe weirdness will morph into a tantalizing challenge come training camp, as the Warriors try to spread shots among Curry, Durant and Klay Thompson. And maybe a few for Green, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a transition,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say guys will have to sacrifice \u2014 I want guys to be who they are, because that\u2019s what makes us so powerful. But there\u2019s a transition in how we see the game, how we see the floor, how the flow goes.\nBefore the Warriors embark on that quest, Curry waded into his new reality at Edgewood. The last time he played in this tournament, in 2013, he was not yet a two-time Most Valuable Player. The Warriors had not yet won the NBA title.\nCurry was popular, but he wasn\u2019t quite Steph Curry.\nSo the person with the biggest job Thursday probably was Ralph Walker, the retired Oakland police officer who serves as Curry\u2019s personal chief of security. Curry patiently signed hundreds and hundreds of autographs, while Walker helped him make his way between holes.\nThe circus was on full display. Several young women screamed in unison on No. 9, asking Curry to pose for a photo. He cleverly stopped, shouted \u201cPhotobomb!\u201d and spread his arms wide with a big smile, appearing in the background of their shot.\nLater, fans on the beach alongside No. 17 threw a football, Frisbee and Warriors hat for Curry to sign. He complied on all three counts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of chaotic, man,\u201d he said.\nAnd, no, it wasn\u2019t nearly as chaotic three years ago in Tahoe. Back then, Curry and a small group of family and friends went out for pizza and a movie to celebrate daughter Riley\u2019s first birthday. Few people bothered them.\nWednesday night\u2019s scene provided a striking contrast. Curry, his dad, Dell, caddie/college roommate Bryant Barr and Walker stopped at Safeway on the way back to their rental house.",

    "text": "\u2022 Fresh Dog \u2122 Dry Shampoo: If you\u2019ve ever used a dry shampoo on your own hair, you know it works by absorbing the oil and dirt from your scalp, leaving your hair looking like it\u2019s just been washed. Fresh Dog's dry shampoo does basically the same thing for your dog. It is a loose powder that you sprinkle directly onto your dog's coat for an instantly clean and freshen appearance.\nWhen applying the product, I found it best to sprinkle a small amount at a time, as using too much at once can cause a cloud of powder. I started at the base of the neck, sprinkling a bit of powder and massaging it in. I continued adding a bit more powder as needed, working my way down the back. A little powder goes a long way and my Schnauzer really enjoyed the massage. Note: I did not apply any product to the face, just to the body and legs.\nWhen I finished applying the product to the areas I wanted to cover, I took a soft bristle brush and brushed my dog out. This helped to distribute the powder even further and removed the excess along with small bits of dirt.\nI actually applied the powder to my dog while in the backyard. Since it was my first time trying out this type of product, I wasn\u2019t sure if the process would be messy or not. It wasn\u2019t. I did notice that my dog\u2019s coat appeared whiter, so dogs with a black coat might need a bit more brushing.\nThe dry shampoo powder is easy-to-use and smells, well\u2026 fresh! The powder is infused with essential oils and has a marvelous lavender rosemary scent. I even deodorized my Schnauzer\u2019s dog bed by sprinkling some onto it, too. It just smells so good. The dry shampoo powder is a good product to use as a quick way to remove odors and freshen up your dog's coat.\n\u2022 Fresh Dog \u2122 Waterless Foam Bath: If your Schnauzer is in need of a bath but you just don\u2019t have the time to do it, this waterless bath foam will solve your problem. Why it\u2019s a bath in a bottle and no water needed!\nJust dispense a few pumps of foam in the palm of your hand and distribute over your dog, taking special care not to get any into the eyes. Massage the foam fully into your dog's coat to loosen and break away any dirt and oils. Then towel dry your dog off... That's It!\nMy Schnauzer did not object to the foam bath at all and in fact, pranced around like \"I got it going on\" when we were done. I think he was just as happy as I was that he was clean and smelling fresh.\nI really like this product. There was no sticky residue and it smells great. I've tried squirt-on waterless shampoos before, but this foam bath is way better. The foam is thicker and richer and distributes the cleaning agent much more effectively, so you end up using less of it.\nnote: Although it is a waterless shampoo, the foam itself does dampen your dog's coat, but you do not need to rinse it out. Just allow the product to do its magic.\nOnce you towel dry your dog, it dries quickly and leaves the coat super soft and smelling great! I loved it!\nYour dog hates regular baths but could really use one about now.\nYour dog has been sick or is recovering from surgery and could use some spot cleaning.\nYou have an older or arthritic dog that has a hard time getting in and out of the tub.\nYou have company coming over and just no time to give your dog(s) a regular bath.\nYou have a multi-dog household and regular bath day becomes an all day job that's a nightmare.\nIt's great for cleaning dogs during those cold winter months.\nIt's a great product to carry along on trips or outings, just in case your dog gets into a smelly situation.\nIt's safe for dogs and puppies over 6 weeks of age.\nFor those who normally bathe their dogs at home: This no mess, no fuss, no back-breaking foam bath is easy to do and allows you to put off having to give your dog the traditional bath so often.\nFor those who usually take their dog to a groomer: Extends the time in-between regular visits to the dog groomer, thereby saving you time and money $$.\nSo for a great alternative to regular shampoos and the dreaded task of giving your dog a bath, try Fresh Dog \u2122! It will leave your dog's coat smelling fresh and clean.\nHow would you like to try out Fresh Dog on your Miniature Schnauzer... for FREE?\nThanks to the good folks at Fresh Dog, one lucky winner will win the set of shampoos to freshen up their own dog(s).\nPrizes: The Happy Dog Bundle - Both innovative dog shampoo products which include (1) 12oz dry shampoo powder and (1) 6oz bottle of the waterless bath foam. A $27 value.\nJust post a comment below, like: I want a Fresh Dog!\nA winner will be chosen at random from those who post a comment below on Friday May 18, 2012. So post a comment and Good Luck!\nAnd the winner is....... Fern Williams!\nAn easy-to-use deodorizing powder for dogs that extends time between regular washings. No water needed.\nWhy it's a dog bath in a bottle - No water needed! No sticky residue, repels dirt, and dries quickly.",

    "text": "In a city full of historic hotels, it can be hard to be the new property on the block. But when The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue debuted in 2013, it found its footing quickly around the Big Apple, distinguishing itself with modern, glamorous d\u00e9cor; an impressive contemporary art collection; crave-worthy Mediterranean fare at Ai Fiori from popular chef Michael White; and touches that Langham is known for, like the sweet ginger flower scent drifting through the building and the pink flowers adorning the lobby.\nThe Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star hotel eventually became the U.S. flagship for the brand, whose origins go back to 1865 with the opening of the opulent London outpost.\nAs The Langham, New York celebrates its fifth anniversary, we checked in with managing director Richard Bussiere, who shared how luxury has evolved over the years and where to find the best view in the Midtown hotel.\nHow has the hotel changed since opening five years ago?\nIn the five years since this hotel became The Langham, we have made some exciting cosmetic changes to the hotel in the form of new guest rooms, actually increasing our room count by 20 through some clever reconfigurations, and adding in two well-designed Penthouses and a Presidential Suite. We also completely revamped and expanded our event space, The Gallery at The Langham, to allow us to better host more signature events.\nAnd we installed a multimillion-dollar art collection by the famed New York painter Alex Katz \u2014 the largest private collection of his work outside of a museum that we know of in New York City.\nBut the most impactful change has been that, in transitioning an existing hotel to be a Langham, we have come to embody all of the best elements of the Langham brand, which has instilled a greater sense of pride in our employees, many of which have been here since the building first opened, and have made us better every day in the service we provide our guests.\nHow have the guests changed?\nWhen Langham took over this hotel, there was a lack of recognition among travelers in the U.S. about the Langham brand, and there was a perception that Midtown was not an ideal location for a luxury hotel.\nOver the last five years, awareness of the Langham brand name has grown, not only domestically but internationally, and Midtown has become a hot spot for hotel development, taking away the perception that this location isn\u2019t ready for a luxury hotel. Both of those factors have allowed our guest loyalty to grow stronger, so we have seen an increase in repeat guests as well as more guests coming from the cities in which our sister hotels are located.\nWhat does luxury hospitality mean to you?\nTwenty-five years ago, \u201cluxury\u201d had a very limited definition. It spoke to customers of a certain age, who drove a specific type of car, lived at a certain address, held a certain position in life. There were certain expectations of a luxury hotel that were understood and well-defined, by both the guests and the industry at large.\nLuxury consumers in 2018 are less defined. They can be from any walk of life, any age, any nationality. And, more often than not, they tell us what luxury is to them rather than us predicting what it will be on their behalf.\nFor those reasons, it is important to stay nimble, be innovative and to personalize the service you offer in the luxury market, because it changes based on the desires of each guest you serve.\nWhat do you think makes The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue special?\nI truly believe our best asset is our colleagues. Being well-versed in the art of hospitality is not something that everyone can attain. We have managed to find and hold onto some of the very best in the industry that have this skill. They stay with us because we continually celebrate their success at the hotel level but also company-wide.\nSome of the stories I could tell you about how our colleagues have gone above and beyond for our guests would give you goosebumps. But even on the most basic level, there is not one member of our team who doesn\u2019t live our values here at The Langham.\nAnd we empower them to make our guests happy. No gesture is too big or too small if it will help that guest create a great memory of their time at our hotel.\nWhat are your favorite parts of the hotel?\nI love our event space, The Gallery at The Langham. It has wonderful natural light and it\u2019s where we house most of our art collection by Alex Katz. It has been the setting for some of our most memorable moments at the hotel as well, since it is where I have the most opportunities to interact with our guests at special events and celebrations.\nI also like the view from the southern side of the building \u2014 our Empire State Views. Not only do they afford a spectacular view of the Empire State Building but, on a clear day, you can see all the way down Fifth Avenue to One World Trade Center, which is an inspiring sight.\nWhat is next for the hotel?\nWe are currently investigating whether we have the space in the hotel to build a Club Lounge, which is something that Langham Hotels around the world are known for, and which would be a wonderful addition for our guests.\nWe are also continuing to strengthen our hotel as being one of the most sustainable in New York City. We currently hold Silver Status from EarthCheck, the independent benchmarking agency employed by Langham Hospitality Group, and we are going for Gold. We have committed to decreasing the overall output of waste from the hotel.\nFor example, we invested in a state-of-the-art Orca machine that turns food waste into environmentally safe water, and which allows us to break down 700 pounds of food per day. On average this investment has allowed us to keep 4,000 pounds of organic waste from going to landfill.\nLangham is opening a hotel in Dubai in 2020. What else is going on for the brand?\nLangham is expanding in very exciting ways over the next few years. In addition to Dubai, Langham has hotels planned for Tokyo, San Francisco and Jakarta, among other locations.\nI started in this industry out of college in 1980. In 1986, I moved to Asia as an expatriate, first in China and then in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. I came back to the U.S. in 2013 to work as the managing director of The Langham, Boston \u2014 my first time working in the U.S. in nearly 30 years.\nThis then lead to my current position, as managing director at Langham, overseeing both The Langham, Boston and The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue, which is really the pinnacle of a career spent doing what I love. To have the opportunity to lead a luxury hotel in the middle of Fifth Avenue to greater and greater success is an achievement that makes me feel proud and excited to come to work every single day.",

    "text": "How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nSubject: How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nI read in another post that iTunes uses a standard list of 125 genres.\nIs it possible to somehow limit the genres Jaikoz assigns to this list of 125 despite what MB or Discogs genres are?\nIt would be nice to have a checkbox that says \"Limit to iTunes genres\".\nI've just discovered the \"Filter/Non-standard-Genres/Non-standard Filters\" option so I guess I could use that to show me which ones are non standard then update them manually however it would be great to have a fuzzy matching option that matches non standard to iTunes standard genres.\nSubject: Re:How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nYour best bet it to use the filter non-iTunes filters, non-standardFIlters limits to 255 genres but only half of these are in the predefined list provided by iTunes.\nHowever these options may be misleading you, although iTunes only recognises 125 genres by number you can still use any value to store a genre, it is just stored as text.\nThe Musicbrainz list is not limited in any sense so it would be rather difficult to map an arbitary Musicbrainz genre to an iTunes one.\nIs there anywhere in Jaikoz I can find the list of 255 genres that Jaikoz is using in this filter AND/OR the 125 iTunes genres so I can make sure that my collection only uses these \"standard\" ones?\nWould be good to have a cross matching facility, for example several of my songs have a genre \"Rock/Pop\" (a single genre) these could be matched to two seperate genres ie \"Rock\" and \"Pop\" then for anything not found in Jaikoz's cross matching genre database the User could enter a nominated genre ie \"Unknown\" so then you have a subset of your music (genre = \"Unknown\") you know needs to be listened to and a genre manually assigned.\nSo the the 125 genres listed are the one iTunes understands by genre number.\nPaul how about this ...if we got 50 people to each donate $10 OR reach $500 of donations (whichever comes first) would you add a genre cross matching function (as explained above) to Jaikoz? We could keep track by each person posting how much they have donated in this thread.\nI would rather see something like what mediamonkey has in some of their plugins. The ability to do white lists, black lists, and grey lists.\nThat way one would have far more control. For your example, you could use the white list and put in the allowed genres you have listed below. Or one could do a blacklist, which allows everything except for certain tags. This is useful for when you tag from other sources and don't want particular tags to show up. Say I tag from last.fm and don't want the tag \"seen live\" to be used. Lastly, the grey list would allow for tag replacement. So I could say anytime you run across the tag \"rock n roll\" replace it with \"rock and roll\" or \"rnb\" to \"r&b\", etc.\n2:The limited set of genres is incomplete and doesnt include newer genres , I dont see that this list should be seen as the definitive list.\nIn September I went to the yearly Musicbrainz Summit and genres were discussed there, see page 12 of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihe2nAatrLHfgPOvXWn_VJQVUVQ36iFy5MY03lTBhMM/edit?pli=1, hopefully a solution will emerge if you are interested in this it would be worth your while posting on the musicbrainz mailing list.\nJaikoz does already have a blacklist Preferences:Remote Correct:Correct Genres that supports wildcards, but not a whitelist or greylist, I can see these being useful additions.\nYes was already aware of this and although very helpful in stopping unwanted genres is not useful in correcting anything not on this list.\nI see limiting the list to the iTunes this to be a major advantage not a disadvantage even if its not a definitive list. Reason being is that people will always disagree on the exact genre of a song so its better to at least have a standard (the 125 iTunes genres) that people must stay within that way genres become a usable way (currently they are not due to so many genres) to sort, listen and create playlists since you know that when you select \"Rock & Roll\" genre you're getting all your Rock & Roll songs and don't also have to also look under \"Rock n Roll\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Rock/Roll\" etc.\nAs its stands there are currently so many permutations of genres it makes them unusable so it would be good to have an option in Jaikoz to \"force\" the use of only \"standard\" genres regardless of what MB or Discogs has assigned to them. Of course this wouldn't prevent people NOT enabling this option and still going with MB, Discogs or their own preferred genres.\nI think greengeek's idea of a white lists is a good way of implementing this ie the white list would be initially populated with only the 125 iTunes genres (however Users could edit this list).\nIn preferences you could \"enable\" the whitelist which tells Jaikoz to enforce the use of these genres only. You would nominate a genre (eg \"Unknown\") that Jaikoz would assign to any songs for genres not found on this whitelist.\nAgain greengeek's idea of a grey list is a good way of enabling Jaikoz to use this list to fuzzy match non standard genres to the iTunes standard genres (or whatever the User decides they want to cross match to) eg \"Rock n Roll\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Rock/Roll\" would all be in the grey list and be assigned to the iTunes standard \"Rock & Roll\" OR a genre of the User's choice if they don't want to use iTunes standard ones.\nYes I like this idea of a grey list, although there is a complication. If the user decides to use both Discogs genres and styles, do we need multiple greylists ?\nI can't think of a scenario where you'd need two greylists as this list is really what the User wants Jaikoz to use to cross match to their \"standard\" genres regardless of where the currently assigned genre came from ie was already assigned to song or came from MB or Discogs lookup.\nAs previously mentioned, by having a checkbox for \"Replace unmatched genres with:\" [User entered genre ie \"Unknown\"] the User would also have an option of either leaving unmatched genres as is OR replacing them with their chosen genre which enables them to seperate out these songs for manual review at a latter date.",

    "text": "Having shared some beauty tips for teenage girls in my previous article, today we\u2019re discussing another common skin related issue constantly pestering all teenagers be it girls or boys which is Blackheads. Contrary to popular belief, blackheads are not caused by dirt but occur when your pores get clogged with excess sebum and dead skin cells. But there is absolutely no need to spend on expensive blackhead removal treatments when there is so much you can do from your very own kitchen. So Zuri\u2019s got you top 5 DIY remedies to get rid of those unsightly blackheads.\n1. Lemon juice: As we all know by now that blackheads are a result of open, clogged pores reacting with oxygen which turn them black. So it would be great if something could shrink those pores down. Lemon is a natural astringent that helps us do just that. So squeeze the juice of a lemon in a bowl, and apply it to the affected areas with a cotton ball to a washed, clean face. Leave it overnight and wash your face with lukewarm water the next morning. Dilute the lemon juice with water in case you have a sensitive skin.\n2. Baking soda scrub: Baking soda is also effective in treating blackheads. It helps get rid of all the dirt, grime from deep within the pores. So make a thick paste of baking soda and mineral water and massage the affected areas gently with this paste for a few minutes. Let it dry and then rinse it off with lukewarm water. Use this remedy twice a week for best results.\n3. Yogurt and oat face pack: Mix together 2 tbsp oats and 3 tbsp yogurt in a bowl. Now add a few drops of lemon juice and olive oil to it. Dab it onto the affected area and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Rinse it off with lukewarm water. Yogurt being rich in lactic acid and oats with its calming properties helps tackle blackheads effectively.\n4. Milk and honey pore strips: We are all aware of the blackhead removal strips available in stores. But alternatively you can also use milk and honey for this purpose. Honey is packed with anti-bacterial properties and milk is rich in lactic acid that helps keep skin clean and soft. And when mixed together, they also make for an excellent adhesive. Mix together 1 tbsp honey and 1 tsp milk and heat in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Now mix it together again and once it reaches a comfortable temperature, apply a thin layer on the blackheads. Next pat a strip of dry, clean cotton on it. Press gently and let it dry for a while. Now carefully peel the strip away and along with it also the blackheads. Later wash the area with cold water and use a moisturizer on top of it.\n5. Cinnamon and honey pore strips: Now this one makes for another very effective blackhead removal technique. Cinnamon improves blood circulation, giving your face a healthy glow and honey with its anti-bacterial properties helps get rid of blackheads. So mix together 1 part cinnamon powder and 1 part honey and apply this mixture onto your blackheads. Now press a clean cotton strip on top of it and let it sit for about 2 \u2013 3 minutes. Now gently peel it off. Wash the area and don\u2019t forget to follow up with a moisturizer.\nSo try one of these simple yet effective remedies and say goodbye to blackheads.",

    "text": "There are two families of ticks that makeup the majority of the ticks in the Northeast. Hard and soft ticks. The major differences are the reproduction cycle. Hard tick females have one blood meal and can produce 10,000 eggs then die. Soft tick females will feed and then lay 20-50 ticks, feed again lay another batch and repeat. In the Northeast the most common hard ticks are the Brown Dog Tick, American Dog Tick and the Deer Tick.\nTicks are very good at hitchhiking. They can sense your vibration, shadow and CO2 as you approach. Ticks wait in areas ideal for a blood meal in a specific position called questing. They have hooks on their legs that are held up and out to hitch onto a passing meal.\nThe three main ticks in the Northeast all have 8 legs as adults, require 2 years to mature from egg to adult and differ in size for the most part. You can easily identify a tick embedded in your skin as it becomes engorged with blood. They all have 4 life stages egg, larva, nymph and adult. Once the egg hatches the larva needs to seek a blood meal, most often mice or other small animals. The ticks in the Northeast will molt after the first blood meal and winter as nymph under leaves or other natural debris protected from winters cold weather. In the spring the nymphs emerge and look for another blood meal. With the meal complete they will molt into adults and look for another blood meal and start the reproduction process.\nTicks can transmit various tick borne human diseases including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. Another less common threat is tick paralysis. A condition that develops during feeding and can result in death but the symptoms disappear rapidly when the tick is removed. When you work outside in a brush or leaf area you run the risk of a tick hitchhiking on your clothes. This is why you should always, if possible wear long sleeves and pants preferable light in color. Tape the pant cuffs tight to your legs to stop ticks from climbing up onto your skin. When you complete the outdoor activities you should remove all clothing and shower. When drying off perform a tick check on all parts of your body. At this stage you are looking for just the tick. In 24 hours stay alert for engorged females.\nThe first step in control is inspection and education. Our pest management professional will inspect your yard and identify the problem areas, areas that should have brush or shrubbery cut back and other non-pesticide items that naturally keep ticks away from your home. Then we treat the \u201chot\u201d areas which are most likely to have a population of ticks. Treatments and inspections are repeated 2 additional applications for traditional treatments and every 3 weeks for organic treatments.",

    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY - Kevin Durant scored 25 points, James Harden added a spark with 23 points off the bench while returning from an injury and the Oklahoma City Thunder ended a string of futility against the Houston Rockets with a 122-104 victory.\nThe Thunder got out to a sizzling start and opened a 23-point lead within the first 14 minutes. Their lead was never in jeopardy against a Houston team desperately needing a late charge to make the playoffs.\nInstead, Oklahoma City used its second-best shooting performance of the season to take a big step toward solidifying its spot in the postseason.\nLuis Scola scored 25 and Trevor Ariza added 20 points for Houston, which fell seven games behind Oklahoma City and 51/2 behind eighth-place Portland in the Western Conference.\nBOSTON - Paul Pierce scored 27 points, Kevin Garnett had 20 and the Boston Celtics clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Denver Nuggets.\nThe Celtics dominated inside and the Nuggets, one day after losing to the Knicks in New York, slipped a half-game behind the Dallas Mavericks and into a third-place tie with Utah in the Western Conference with their third consecutive loss.\nBoston led by 21 points twice in the third quarter before Denver cut the lead to 87-80 going into the fourth. But the Celtics stayed ahead by seven to 16 the rest of the way for their fifth win in six games. Rajon Rondo had a triple-double with 11 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds.\nCarmelo Anthony led Denver with 32 points and J.R. Smith added 21.\nTORONTO - Deron Williams had 18 points, 16 assists and eight rebounds, leading the Utah Jazz to victory over the Toronto Raptors.\nCarlos Boozer added 18 points and 11 rebounds, while Mehmet Okur and rookie Wesley Matthews had 16 points apiece for the Jazz, who won their third straight. Seven Jazz players finished with at least 12 points.\nChris Bosh celebrated his 26th birthday with a 20-point performance for the Raptors (35-35), who fell 11/2 games behind Charlotte and Miami in the race for sixth place in the Eastern Conference.\nAntoine Wright had 10 of his 15 points in the second quarter for the Raptors, while Andrea Bargnani added 12 and Jose Calderon 10.\nATLANTA - Josh Smith swooped in to slam through Joe Johnson's missed shot just ahead of the buzzer and the Atlanta Hawks finally beat the Orlando Magic, clinching a third straight trip to the playoffs.\nThe Hawks bounced back from an early 15-2 deficit and overcame going 8:45 in the fourth quarter without a field goal against a division rival that had routed them three times this season. For Atlanta, it came down to the final shot of regulation for the fifth straight game.\nINDIANAPOLIS - Danny Granger scored 31 points to help the Indiana Pacers beat the Washington Wizards and extend Washington's losing streak to a franchise record-tying 13 games.\nAndray Blatche started for the Wizards a night after he was benched for most of the game following a spat with coach Flip Saunders.\nThe Wizards last lost 13 straight in 1995. They can set a record for futility Friday at Charlotte.\nIt was Granger's third straight game with at least 30 points. Josh McRoberts had 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds for the Pacers, who have won four in a row overall and six straight at home.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. - Stephen Jackson shook off a sore hand and busted out of his shooting slump with 37 points, leading the Charlotte Bobcats past Minnesota to send the reeling Timberwolves to their 14th straight loss.\nJackson, who a night earlier revealed he had been plagued by a bruised ligament near his left index finger, hit 15-of-24 shots after shooting 37 percent in the previous 10 games. Gerald Wallace added 23 points as the Bobcats shot 54 percent from the field and moved into sixth place in the Eastern Conference with their sixth straight home win.\nAl Jefferson scored 21 points for the Timberwolves, who came apart in a 20-0 Charlotte run in the second quarter to drop to 5-32 on the road.\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Brook Lopez had 26 points and 13 rebounds, and New Jersey Nets moved a step closer to avoiding a dubious date with NBA history by beating the Sacramento Kings to snap an eight-game losing streak and a franchise-record, 14-game skid at home.\nDevin Harris added 24 points and nine assists for the Nets (8-63), who need to win once in their last 11 games to avoid breaking the league mark for fewest wins in a season (9-73), set by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1972-73.\nNets interim coach Kiki Vandeweghe guided the team despite learning of the death of his mother, former Miss America Colleen Kay Hutchins, earlier in the day.\nBeno Udrih had 19 points for the Kings, who lost the eighth time in 11 games.\nMILWAUKEE - Rookie Jrue Holiday had 15 points and seven assists, leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a victory over the Bucks that snapped Milwaukee's longest home winning streak in six years at eight games.\nIt was a dismal display for Milwaukee, which had won 15 of the last 17 to virtually assure a postseason berth for the first time since 2006.\nInstead, Samuel Dalembert had 12 points and 10 rebounds, Willie Green scored 16 points and Andre Iguodala 14 as the Sixers poured it on for their third win in the last 16 games.\nJerry Stackhouse scored 15 points and rookie Brandon Jennings added 12 for Milwaukee, but the Bucks shot 5 of 28 from 3-point range and led only once in the game, 3-0.\nNEW ORLEANS - LeBron James scored an efficient 38 points on 15 of 22 shooting to go with nine assists, and the Cleveland Cavaliers won their eighth straight game, over the New Orleans Hornets.\nJ.J. Hickson scored 20 for the Cavs, who led by as many as 17 and never trailed after James' floater tied it at 10 in the first quarter. Delonte West added 15 points and Antawn Jamison had 11 points and 11 rebounds as Cleveland won its 27th straight over a team with a losing record.\nMarcus Thornton scored 20 points and Darren Collison added 17 for the Hornets, who will be eliminated from the playoffs if Portland wins today. David West added 16 points.",

Perhaps other older readers might know.\nElaine Richards,Salt AshSTEVEN Busch (Short Takes, 4/10) I agree with you when you say that, when daylight savings begins, there is some disruption to our daily lives. But the emphasisshould be on the word \u201csome\u201d (as it\u2019s definitely not a great deal). I believe that daylight savings does actually serve a useful and practical purpose (many in fact), so yes, I would say that the adjustment period is necessary. Especially when considering that said adjustment period is all of a few days at most.\nAdam Carter,Adamstown HeightsWHYare they wasting money on advertising about revitalising Newcastle instead of just getting on with the job?\nDebra Forbes,WickhamI UNDERSTAND how you feel Mr Cooper-Johnston (Letters, 5/10), as residents of the Lambton area living close to the Hunter Stadium, Lambton pool and Lambton junior football fields we are constantly unable to park anywhere near home during summer and winter, and we have never been consulted by the NRL or Newcastle council to see if the traffic impacts on our everyday coming and going.

Nothing was too much trouble and they always showed care and kindness. Once again, thank you all so much.\nJ Greentree,TamworthTHE people living inside the proposed Supercars track who aren\u2019t interested in racing, should look into renting their houses out for the week to the race teams or corporate sponsors.

And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.\n5 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.\n7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.\n9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.\n10 And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.\n12 and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet [speaking] from the mouth of Jehovah.\n13 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.\n14 Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.\n16 but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.\n17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.\n18 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.\n21 to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: [for] as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.\n23 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

An asset is an item of economic value that is expected to yield a benefit to the owing entity in future periods. Assets are classified as being either current or noncurrent assets. A current asset, such as cash, account receivable, and prepaid expenses, is expected to be consumed within one year, while noncurrent assets, such as long-term investments, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, are to be consumed in more than one year. This course includes a discussion of both current and noncurrent assets. For example, promulgated GAAP for current assets is provided in ASC 210-10-45-1 through 45-4, Balance Sheet: Overall. Receivables are covered in ASC 310 Receivables comprising nonrefundable fees, loans and debt securities, and troubled debt restructurings by creditors. Guidance on the accounting and reporting of inventory is provided in ASC 330 Inventory. ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment provides guidance on accounting for long-lived tangle assets such as land and land improvements, buildings, and equipment.\nThis course is included in the MEGA CPE Bundle.\nFormat: Online pdf (111 pages).\n\u2022 Recognize how to properly account for and classify assets.\n\u2022 Indicate how cash and related items are reported.\n\u2022 Recognize receivables and how to correctly factor and assign them.\n\u2022 Identify correct disclosure requirements for receivables.\n\u2022 Recognize how to account for inventories including different costs, consigned goods, financing product arrangements and lower of cost or market.\n\u2022 Recognize how to compute inventory balances using the LIFO method.\n\u2022 Identify proper disclosure requirements for inventory.\n\u2022 Recognize how to account for different fixed asset costs.\n\u2022 Identify accounting procedures for fixed assets such as conversions, depletion and exchange/disposal of assets.\n\u2022 Recognize disclosure requirements for fixed assets.\n\u2022 Recognize the accounting procedures for depletion of natural resources.\n\u2022 Identify the procedures for amortizing intangible assets.\n\u2022 Recognize the disclosure requirements for intangibles.",

The museum features a glimpse of life for a typical middle class Georgia family in 1850.\nBuilt in 1845 by early settlers Hannah and William Root, the Root House is one of just a few buildings that survived Sherman\u2019s Atlanta Campaign. The house used as a single-family residence until the 1940\u2019s when it was divided into apartments.\nBy the late 1980\u2019s, the house was in disrepair and scheduled for demolition. When it was found to be one of the oldest buildings in Marietta, it was purchased by the Cobb Landmarks and Historical Society and restored to it\u2019s 1845 appearance.\nEvery room in the Root House contains authentic period pieces, allowing visitors to learn the story of the Root family and life in Civil War era Georgia. The tour includes opportunities to touch some of the historic artifacts and play 19th century games, as well as use modern electronic tablets to view historic records, family photos, and more.\nStepping outside, visitors can see the recreated kitchen that includes a working 1850s cook-stove and a garden that features flower beds and vegetables that were available in the area before 1860.\nTours at 11:30, 12:30, 1:30, and 2:30.\nFor more information, please call (770) 426-4982 or visit RootHouseMuseum.com.",

Causes of Heart Failure: What every physician needs to know.\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable to provide sufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of the body, or is only able to do so with significantly increased intracardiac filling pressure. However, this is a somewhat older definition, and many people now define heart failure as a clinical syndrome where there is structural heart disease and impaired function.\nHeart failure is often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF). Many experts believe that the term \u201ccongestion\u201d does not uniformly apply to all patients, and the syndrome is often referred to as \u201cheart failure\u201d in more contemporary times.\nHeart failure is most often characterized as systolic, if ejection fraction (EF) is decreased, and diastolic, if ejection fraction is preserved. \u201cDiastolic\u201d heart failure is also often called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) or heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFPSF).\nSystolic heart failure is often due to damage to the heart, such as ischemia or alcohol exposure. Diastolic heart failure is often due to longstanding hypertension or intracardiac infiltration such as with amyloid protein, which \u201cstiffens\u201d both ventricles. It is not usually possible to distinguish systolic from diastolic heart failure based on signs and symptoms alone, as both share substantial clinical features.\nII. Diagnostic Confirmation: Are you sure your patient has Heart Failure?\nHeart failure is diagnosed at the bedside using history and physical findings. There is no absolute laboratory test for the diagnosis of heart failure.\nA characteristic history includes exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. Physical exam would be notable for volume overload (jugular venous distention, dependent edema), S3 gallop, and often pulmonary rales.\nHowever, it is important to note that the absence of rales does not exclude heart failure, as the lymphatic system can provide substantial compensation, particularly in patients with chronic heart failure. Pulmonary congestion is typically evident on chest radiography.\nPlasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) levels are typically elevated, although renal failure and obesity are commonly recognized confounders. The hallmark laboratory exam of heart failure is an echocardiogram.\nThe presence of a decreased EF is sufficient to give a diagnosis of systolic heart failure; other modalities such as gated nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or gated computed tomography (CT) are also able to determine EF.\nDiastolic heart failure is diagnosed in the presence of the clinical syndrome of heart failure with preserved EF. Efforts should be made to determine the etiology of heart failure.\nExertional dyspnea and fatigue are virtually universal. Volume overload is usually found, but in the modern era of powerful loop diuretics, some patients do not manifest fluid overload.\nNocturnal symptoms such as orthopnea and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) are also highly suggestive of heart failure. Abdominal discomfort or fullness is also a frequently reported symptom. Patients with well-compensated heart failure may have minimal symptoms and no evidence of volume overload. Characteristics of end-stage heart failure may include cachexia and Cheyne-Stokes respirations.\nApproximately half of patients with heart failure have systolic failure and the other half have diastolic heart failure. Some have features of both types. Heart failure is perhaps more common in men and in those who identify as black racially.\nRisk increases with age. Regardless, the most important risk factors for developing heart failure on a population basis are hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetes.\nThe majority of diastolic heart failure is a result of longstanding hypertension, and this phenotype of heart failure is more common in women. Infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis and hemochromatosis, also typically lead to diastolic heart failure, often with restrictive physiology.\nPrior chest radiation is another potential cause of diastolic heart failure, and the incidence may increase as prolonged cancer survivorship increases. Once patients are hospitalized with diastolic heart failure, the prognosis is approximately the same as systolic heart failure.\nHypertension and diabetes also increase the risk of systolic heart failure through the increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions. Thus efforts to minimize coronary artery disease would be anticipated to have substantial impact on risk of developing heart failure.\nThe causes of systolic heart failure are myriad, including coronary artery disease, genetic or familial, viral (including HIV), idiopathic, valvular, inflammatory (myocarditis, sarcoidosis), thyroid disease, tachycardia-mediated (often from previously unrecognized atrial fibrillation), stress-induced (also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), nutritional deficiency (such as thiamine or selenium), systemic myopathies (such as muscular dystrophies), and peripartum cardiomyopathy.\nAlcohol, cocaine, methamphetamines, anthracyclines, some antirheumatic medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are common toxic causes of heart failure, which are typically identified through patient history.\nCommon alternative causes of volume overload include renal failure, liver failure, and hypoalbuminemia. Common alternative causes of exertional breathlessness are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and pneumonia. Coronary artery disease also may present with a dyspnea-predominant phenotype, rather than chest pain, as is classically expected.\nEvaluation of the central venous pressure is of the utmost importance.\nProfoundly low cardiac output states may be characterized by hypotension and/or narrow pulse pressure along with cool or mottled skin.\nSinus tachycardia is common but may be compensatory.\nChest x-ray (CXR) and EKG are essential in the evaluation of a patient with suspected heart failure. Beyond providing information supporting the diagnosis of heart failure, these diagnostic tests often provide an alternative diagnosis (atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, lung mass, etc.) that implies heart failure may not be the key diagnosis.\nEchocardiogram is also essential and will provide substantial information about the size, structure, and function of the heart. MRI, which provides detailed information on the myocardium, should be considered.\nMRI can provide strong, noninvasive evidence of etiology in many cases, such as prior infarction, myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, stress or \u201cTakotsubo\u201d cardiomyopathy, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or hemochromatosis, for example. Positron emission tomography (PET) can also be used to diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis.\nEndomyocardial biopsy should be considered in highly select circumstances, such as suspicion of myocarditis. Biopsy also has a role in defining the subtype of amyloid cardiomyopathy (e.g., transthyretin versus amyloid light-chain (AL)). Patients with a family history of cardiomyopathy should be offered the option of referral for genetic counseling and testing.\nBNP (or NT-proBNP) should be considered, particularly if other causes of dyspnea such as COPD are being considered if there is doubt about the diagnosis. Very low levels virtually exclude heart failure, but can be confounded by obesity.\nElevated levels can be seen in renal failure without substantial heart failure, but at least suggest volume overload. Elevated BNP in the absence of renal failure is strongly suggestive of heart failure, but BNP levels are increased with age.\nBasic metabolic parameters including renal and hepatic function should be measured. Renal dysfunction may be a seen as a result of low cardiac output or elevated venous filling pressure.\nHepatic parameters (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) and international normalized ratio (INR) may be elevated as a consequence of hepatic congestion. Serum albumin is helpful in excluding malnutrition as an alternative explanation for peripheral edema.\nMinor elevations in troponin are characteristic of heart failure exacerbation, but typically do not rise and fall as in acute coronary syndrome; myocarditis should be considered if troponin is substantially elevated. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) would also be typically elevated in myocarditis, but are not diagnostic if elevated. Anemia (hemoglobin or hematocrit) and gout (uric acid) and are also frequent comorbidities to consider.\nAdditional testing to establish the etiology of heart failure should be considered and may include: HIV, ferritin (hemochromatosis), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and serum free light chains (amyloid), for example. Testing for specific viruses other than HIV is not routinely performed, but Coxsackie, Epstein-Barr, and varicella zoster could be considered. Exclusion of connective tissue disease with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is also often performed.\nCXR film (Figure 1) may show cardiomegaly, but the absence does not exclude heart failure. Pulmonary edema is an important finding, but can be confused with pneumonitis or other causes of diffuse infiltrates. Accompanying findings such as pleural effusions may be helpful in interpretation.\nChest x-ray film demonstrating cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.\nAn echocardiogram will provide size; structural detail, including evaluation of valves; and myocardial function, including EF and presence of absence of regional wall motion abnormalities. This is the most important test when considering heart failure as a diagnosis.\nAbdominal ultrasound may demonstrate hepatomegaly and/or ascites, although these findings are often evident on exam and thus are not routinely indicated.\nThe hallmarks of treatment of diastolic heart failure are control of congestion, heart rate in the presence of atrial fibrillation to increase ventricular filling time, and control of systolic blood pressure. The majority of evidence on the treatment of heart failure has been for systolic heart failure, and is thus the focus of the remainder of this section.\nThere are three \u201cto do\u2019s\u201d in the management of heart failure: (1) control congestion, (2) provide neurohormonal antagonists, and (3) consider sudden cardiac death prevention and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Since congestion causes most symptoms, this should be prioritized.\nCongestion control is achieved with sodium and sometimes (if there is hyponatremia) moderate fluid restriction; most patients need loop diuretics. Congestion is managed the same for systolic and diastolic heart failure.\nSecond, neurohormonal antagonists (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilators in select populations) are critical for the treatment of systolic heart failure and should be initiated. Although it is critical to use the drugs and doses that were found to be effective in landmark clinical trials, very few patients will tolerate initiation of full doses of these medications, and a period of uptitration over several weeks to months should be anticipated.\nThere is no consensus regarding whether beta-blockers or ACEI/ARB should be initiated first, and beta-blockers should be avoided in the setting of cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, or bronchospasm. Studies of neurohormonal antagonists for diastolic heart failure have been disappointing, but neurohormonal antagonists are still often used for their antihypertensive effect, and their safety in this population is well-established.\nAlthough there is no mortality benefit, digoxin has been noted to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of hospitalization. Finally, consideration should be given to \u201celectrical therapy,\u201d which consists of CRT (if QRS >130 ms) and sudden cardiac death prevention with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).\nThe risk of sudden cardiac death is much higher with an EF <35%, and in the absence of contraindications such as life expectancy less than 1 year, electrical therapy should be considered. Patients should be receiving optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months before implanting an ICD.\nWearable external defibrillators are sometimes used during the period of medical uptitration to permit reevaluation of EF; a sizable fraction of patients will improve on medical therapy to the point that an implantable ICD is not indicated.\nPatients who are unable to tolerate medical therapy or experience progression despite these therapies suggest a very poor prognosis and may be considered for advanced options, such as mechanical circulatory support (MCS, also known as ventricular assist device or VAD) or heart transplant.\nACEI/ARB and beta-blockers are both initiated at minimal dose, but uptitration of ACEI/ARB is typically prioritized, as full dose can typically be achieved more quickly. Beta-blocker dose is then increased every 1 to 2 weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Timing of the introduction of aldosterone antagonist is individualized based on need for diuretics and potassium supplementation, and often deferred to prioritize ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers.\nAdministration of diuretics is the hallmark of emergency treatment of heart failure and most patients respond promptly. Inadequate response should precipitate rapid escalation of a diuretic dose.\nA common rule of thumb is to double an ineffective dose. Consideration should be given to vasodilators if systemic blood pressure is adequate (e.g., mean arterial pressure greater than 70 to 75 mm Hg). In the event of hypotension or cardiogenic shock, initiation of inotropes, such as dobutamine and/or dopamine, may be necessary. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is an option and mechanical support such as an intraaortic balloon pump may also be indicated.\nIn addition to evaluation of symptomatic response, physical exam findings that should be monitored while providing treatment for heart failure include frequent evaluation of jugular venous pressure and vital signs, with particular attention to blood pressure and heart rate. Sinus tachycardia is often a compensatory response and improvement is thought to represent a favorable response to treatment.\nSerial examinations should also focus attention on the presence of absence of S3/S4, liver span, presence or absence of ascites, and degree and distribution of edema. Urine output should also be monitored, as this provides the most direct measure of pace of decongestion and also indicates adequate (or not) renal perfusion.\nBasic metabolic panels are typically performed shortly after initiation of therapy (at least daily while hospitalized), to monitor renal function and ensure that diuretics are not causing dangerous perturbations in serum potassium levels. Following initiation of aldosterone antagonists, more frequent monitoring of potassium is indicated.\nA commonly used strategy is 1 week after initiation or dose increase, and then again at 1 month. Once a stable medication regimen has been established, routine intermittent testing in heart failure patients is not typically performed. There is some data to suggest that BNP levels may be used to guide therapy.\nMaintaining patients with heart failure on maximally tolerated doses of neurohormonal antagonists (ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists) are critical to minimizing risk of disease progression, symptomatic decompensation, hospitalization, and mortality. Application of CRT when indicated has also been shown to improve outcomes, and should be periodically reconsidered, as patient status or criteria for implant may change over time.\nEducation on salt avoidance, the role of fluid restriction, and self-care including daily weight monitoring are all important to reduce burden of disease and avoid hospitalization. Over time, it is not uncommon for patients with heart failure to become intolerant to maximal doses of medical therapy.\nThe need to decrease the doses of medications is a predictor of adverse outcome, and may be an appropriate time to consider evaluation for advanced options. For patients with end-stage disease, palliative care and/or hospice may be appropriate, and deactivation of ICD may be considered.\nDigoxin is sometimes used in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with insufficient rate control. Typical dose is 62.5 to 250 mcg daily.\nConcurrent anemia: Treatment may improve heart failure symptoms.\nConcurrent arrhythmias: Consider the role that uncontrolled arrhythmias may have on heart failure exacerbation. Improved control of atrial fibrillation or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may improve symptoms. Many antiarrhythmics are contraindicated in severe heart failure.\nConcurrent chronic kidney disease: Continue ACEI/ARB if possible, but if necessary to discontinue, replace with isosorbide/hydralazine combination. May contribute to anemia. Aldosterone antagonists have a substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia.\nConcurrent diabetes: Avoid thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in all heart failure patients and metformin if there is significant renal dysfunction.\nConcurrent gout: It is likely that diuretic dosing will need to be increased if a gout flareup is treated with steroids.\nConcurrent liver disease: Liver congestion is common and may result in the need to alter dose of medications metabolized by the liver.\nConcurrent prostatic hypertrophy: Alpha blockers should be avoided, as they have been shown to increase mortality in heart failure patients.\nConcurrent sleep apnea: Should be treated aggressively to minimize neurohormonal activation.\nAldosterone antagonists should not be used in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease.\nConsider use of the Seattle Heart Failure Model or the Heart Failure Survival Score for estimating a patient\u2019s prognosis.\nConsider referral to dietitian to augment teaching on importance of low-salt diet.\nWeigh yourself at the same time every day and record the result. Report increases of more than 3 lb in a day or 5 lb in a week to your doctor; however, not all decompensations are preceded by antecedent weight gain.\nAvoid sodium intake and strive to keep less than 2,000 mg daily.\nTake your medications as prescribed every day.\nReport changes in symptoms promptly.\n\u201c2009 Focused update incorporated into the ACC/AHA 2005 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines.

    "text": "Buy stocks now that will stand the test of time and pay you to invest.\nWe love talking about the hot stocks here on the blog but what about the stocks you can buy and know they\u2019ll produce solid returns for decades?\nHow do you find those forever stocks you can buy and just sit back and collect the checks?\nIt\u2019s something every investor needs to know. Gone are the days you could just park your money in huge companies like GE and feel confident that your money will be there when you retire.\nIn this video, I\u2019ll reveal the three factors I look for when buying stocks for the long-term and five stocks to buy right now.\nNow I love to buy deep-value stocks and benefit from that near-term rebound. Perfect example is the Hanesbrands position in our 2019 Stock Market Challenge. I saw rising online sales and strength in the activewear segment ahead of a 52% surge in the shares.\nBut you also need to be investing for the long-term, right? We want to be building a portfolio that benefits from quick wins but one where our stocks are going to withstand the test of time.\nFortunately, there is a way to get both. Get that short-term pop plus the long-term returns that will beat your investing goals, or as I call them, forever stocks.\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing today. In this video, I\u2019ll show you the three factors I look for when picking stocks to buy for the long-term. I\u2019ll cover each factor then I\u2019m going to be revealing five stocks to buy right now that I think will produce those double-digit returns over the next 30 years.\nThe first factor I\u2019m looking for in forever stocks is a dividend yield and there are a few reasons for that.\nFirst is that, stocks that pay dividends just tend to do better. Now this graphic is a little jumbled but groups of stocks paying dividends and those with a history of growing their dividends are the blue lines at the top while no-dividend stocks and those cutting their cash payouts are the two bottom lines. The research this was based on has been sliced and diced every way but the simple truth is that dividend-paying companies beat the market.\nOne of the reasons for this is because that dividend payout acts as cash discipline on management. It\u2019s harder to spend on those questionable projects if you know you\u2019ve got to meet that $400 million dividend payment at the end of the quarter.\nThat dividend payment is like having some of your paycheck automatically invested instead of it sitting in your checking account tempting you to spend it on whatever commercial you see next. If you just don\u2019t have the money sitting around, you\u2019re less likely to spend it on stupid crap you don\u2019t need.\nAnother reason I want to be investing in dividend stocks is because it\u2019s always a positive return. This chart shows the percentage of return from dividends and price in each decade. Dividends might be a small part of your return when the market is booming like in the 90s but when the stock market crashes, that dividend return may be all you collect. Thirty years is a lot of bear markets so having those dividend stocks is going to be a lot of protection.\nNow when I\u2019m looking for dividend stocks, I want a company paying a yield of at least 2%. That\u2019s the average dividend yield on the S&P 500 so I like to look for stocks paying maybe a little above average.\nI also want to look at the payout ratio though and this is something we\u2019ve talked about before. The payout ratio is the percentage of profits paid out to cover the dividend. I like to see a payout ratio of 60% or less so I know the company is keeping enough money back for growth as well as making those cash payments.\nSo obviously you know I\u2019m all about dividend stocks but there\u2019s another side of investing, looking at companies with the fastest growth. Think names like Tesla, Netflix and Amazon. This growth investing can be just as profitable or more than dividend investing so I need your opinion. Which do you want to see more videos about, dividend or growth investing. Just scroll down below the video and let me know in the comments.\nAn important note here, any type of investing can get really expensive if you\u2019re buying and selling a lot. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using M1 Finance for our 2019 stock market challenge for a no-fee investing option that saves thousands.\nThe second factor I\u2019m looking for in these long-term stocks to buy is going to take advantage of big macro trends. This means finding companies that will benefit from those large, universal trends like aging populations, food demand, automation.\nWe\u2019re talking the massive, unstoppable forces that will unfold over decades. This kind of long-term investing is the best thing you can do for your portfolio and it\u2019s really how some of these hedge funds managers like Seth Klarman make their billions.\nThis is one of my favorite ways to invest because it makes it so easy. You\u2019re looking at these big trends and thinking, OK which sectors or industries of the economy will benefit? Those forces are going to drive demand for every company in that sector and industries so once you answer that question, you just look for the leaders in the group.\nThe best part is, you don\u2019t have to pick that one best company because all the players in the group will benefit from these massive shifts.\nSome of the biggest macro trends I\u2019m watching include aging populations, so the fact that 10,000 Americans are reaching retirement age everyday and that\u2019s going to affect everything from government services to consumer spending.\nFood demand, global agricultural production just isn\u2019t keeping up with demand, obviously automation and artificial intelligence will bring huge shifts in work and other areas.\nBig data, and especially with the coming 5G networks I think will bring a wave of changes. Finally the shift in economic and political strength to Asia and here we\u2019re not only talking about China which is the big one but also India and other parts of the region.\nThe third factor I\u2019m looking for in long-term stocks is going to be just as important and that\u2019s companies safe from the destruction in those macro trends. Just as a lot of opportunities are created from those massive trends, there\u2019s also going to be that creative destruction that is the hallmark of capitalism.\nWith this one, think of entire industries like newspapers and magazines. Think of once hugely successful companies like Kodak that, while it\u2019s survived, it\u2019s hard to argue that the company is the giant it used to be.\nHere I\u2019m thinking about industries at risk from automation and AI and we\u2019re not just talking about making the industry obsolete but the kind of change that will be hard for companies to keep up with.\nThere will always be a need for banking but the evolution to online banking, peer-to-peer lending and even digital currencies is making it very difficult for banks to keep up. You could have a best-of-breed bank stock but if they aren\u2019t constantly adapting to these changes, it\u2019s not going to last the thirty years.\nI\u2019m also looking at companies at risk to big regulatory concerns and what we\u2019ll just call Death-by-Amazon. So here I want to stay away from pharmacy retail and drug makers, not because I think those industries won\u2019t be around but because these big risks are evolving so quickly that a lot of companies won\u2019t be able to keep up.\nSo those three factors are guiding my long-term investments but of course, I\u2019m still doing that deep fundamental analysis when I pick stocks. I\u2019m looking at cash flows and profitability like we\u2019ve talked about in other videos and finding companies with a distinct advantage over competitors.\nI know it\u2019s a lot but nobody said finding the best stocks for the next 30 years would be easy. Now I\u2019m going to reveal five names that I think could make the cut. Some of these are going to be pretty safe bets while others could be a little more risky.\nOur first stock is an anchor for a lot of portfolios, Campbells Soup, ticker CPB. The $10 billion leader in packaged foods controls 60% of the canned soup market and a strong position in snacks and beverages. That kind of market share and size gives it negotiating power against retailers in shelf-space and pricing.\nManagement has made some missteps over the last couple of years but has also been the victim of some bad economics in food packaging. Food costs have been rising at around 3% annually but companies haven\u2019t been able to pass these increases on to customers so profitability has suffered. Shares have fallen about 45% since mid-2016 but represent some great value right now.\nManagement has already driven $550 million in cost savings and expects another $400 million through 2022 which should rekindle some profitability. They\u2019re also expecting to announce buyers for the international business and Bolthouse Farms Fresh segment by the end of the year. The two segments represent about $2.1 billion in revenue so I\u2019m modeling around $4 billion from buyers that will significantly help to pay down some of that debt that\u2019s acting as an overhang on the shares.\nEarnings are expected 0.8% lower over the next four quarters but the company has a strong history of beating expectations. I\u2019m forecasting $2.55 in earnings per share on stronger profitability which would put the shares around 14-times on a price-to-earnings basis.\nThe shares trade at a price of just 1.1-times sales which is a 40% discount to the five-year average and almost half the two-times average price-to-sales multiple in the industry so some good value here.\nBesides a great valuation, solid dividend and just the strength of the company\u2019s business, I love Campbells here for a potential catalyst. Activist hedge fund Third Point has been battling the company for years to unlock shareholder value and take control from the Dorrance family. The hedge fund owns about 7% of the shares and finally won an agreement last November to add two of its nominees to the board of directors.\nThat means shareholders have a strong voice on the board that is expert in increasing value. The hedge fund has said everything is on the table including a breakup of the company or asset sales to unlock value and investors get paid a 3.9% dividend while they wait.\nSo I like Campbells but you\u2019re thinking, mmmm I just don\u2019t see soup as a growth market that\u2019s going to jump over the next 30 years. What else ya got for me?\nChina Mobile, ticker CHL, hits our list of stocks to buy for the long-term next. Just about every U.S. company has a \u2018china\u2019 plan to break into some part of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Even though the U.S. economy is still about twice as big, China\u2019s economy is adding almost twice the value to its economy every year because it\u2019s growing so fast.\nGetting exposure to that growth through U.S. companies with sales in China just isn\u2019t enough. EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR needs to own some Chinese domestic stocks and China Mobile is one of my top picks.\nThe telecom company controls 61% of the 4G market and 60% of the total wireless market. With 916 million subscribers, it\u2019s the largest telecom in the world and despite this ginormous size already, it\u2019s still posting some astonishing growth. China Mobile also became the country\u2019s largest fixed broadband provider last year, controlling 42% of the market and accounting for 73% of all new broadband customers versus the other two telecoms China Unicom and China Telecom.\nChina is determined to be the leader in 5G, it\u2019s said so publicly and this is one of the first tech evolutions where it really has a chance to set the pace and it\u2019s going to do it. That\u2019s going to open up a lot of opportunity for telecoms and the broader economy. IoT smart connections among corporate clients increased 154% in the first half of last year to 384 million, that\u2019s already more than the entire population of the United States.\nBehind all this growth is also one of the strongest balance sheets I\u2019ve seen with $70 billion in cash, that\u2019s more than 30% of the company\u2019s stock market value. For comparison, Apple\u2019s cash stock pile is less than 10% of its market value and China Mobile is generating over $7.6 billion in free cash flow every year.\nShares pay a 3.9% dividend yield and the company pays out 48% of profits to the dividend which is solid but still obviously leaves lots of money for growth. At a price-to-sales ratio of two-times which is just under the 2.15-times average over the last five years, the shares aren\u2019t a bargain here but the long-term potential is undisputed.\nThere is one major drawback to China Mobile, the controlling ownership by the Chinese government. As the controlling shareholder and regulator of all three domestic telecom operators, the government is a limiting force on how powerful any one company can become. In fact, over the last decade, it\u2019s swapped out the CEOs of the companies twice to try distributing management experience and knowledge. The upside to all of this is that the Chinese market will continue to grow and the government wouldn\u2019t consider letting anyone else play beyond the three established companies so you basically have an implicit guarantee for China Mobile.\nConAgra Foods, ticker CAG, is one I added to our 2019 Dividend Portfolio in February. The company is a U.S. powerhouse in prepared meals where it\u2019s the second-largest in the industry. It has a 40% market share in canned tomatoes and more than a fifth of the meat snacks market with Slim Jim. The company has some solid brands in that relatively safer consumer staples sector so we\u2019re talking dividends as well as a recession-proof industry.\nManagement fumbled big time with last year\u2019s Pinnacle acquisition and had to lower the profit outlook by 20% late last year. The problems were centered around Pinnacle\u2019s distribution business so a little harder to read but management has been very transparent since December about its plans going forward. I think they\u2019re being overly conservative on estimates for a 5% sales decline and margin loss on the Pinnacle assets so the next surprise could be on the upside when things come out better than expected.\nDespite the missteps, the Pinnacle deal still brought a lot of opportunity to the company with a position in the faster-growing frozen foods space. Consumer data is showing millennials are adopting frozen meals at a higher rate than previous generations and it\u2019s hard to imagine a tech shift that could put this industry in jeopardy.\nShares of ConAgra pay a 3.9% dividend which management has affirmed with its new 2019 outlook and trade for just 9.9-times trailing earnings, that\u2019s a 41% discount to the price multiple where it was trading in November. Cash flow is still solid and management is expecting $215 million in cost savings through 2022 on the acquisition. The average analyst price target is 50% higher than the current price and even the lowest price target is 8% higher.\nNext we have the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, ticker VNQ, which is probably my favorite exchange traded fund and another in our 2019 challenge portfolio. It holds shares of 187 real estate companies spread across all the property types and across the United States.\nEveryone in the community knows I\u2019m a huge believer in real estate. I got my first professional job as a commercial property analyst while in college, I\u2019ve managed my own rental properties and have seen real estate create more fortunes than any other asset. Real estate is truly a generational wealth-builder and will always be in demand.\nThe fund pays a 4.2% dividend yield and has returned 14.7% annually over the last decade. Beyond the solid cash yield and return, this is a great opportunity to take a little risk out of the stock market and have it in a real physical asset like property.\nThe fund has been under pressure over the last couple of years because of those rising interest rates. Obviously with the leverage used in real estate, any time you have rising rates, that\u2019s going to weigh on returns but the Fed has signaled no more rate hikes this year and that could unleash a lot of value in real estate.\nWe saw the real estate fund in blue here outperforming stocks through 2017 when rates started heading higher. Looking more recently with that market crash last year and we\u2019re seeing real estate outperform again.\nNow I know I said I wanted to stay away from pharmaceutical stocks because of that potential for regulatory problems over drug prices but I think Cardinal Health, ticker CAH, deserves a spot on the list. The $15 billion leader in medical supplies and pharmaceutical distribution to hospitals and pharmacies is diversified enough that I think it can withstand some of that regulatory risk.\nThe biggest reason I\u2019d overlook that risk of problems with drug pricing is the company\u2019s position in one of the biggest and surest demographic trends, the aging population. The very middle of the Baby Boomer generation, those born in 1955, turn 64 years old this year. That still puts a tidal wave of people over the next two decades that will be increasing the demand for healthcare.\nBetween AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, these three companies control 90% of the pharmaceutical wholesale market in the country. Even if we do see true enthusiasm for drug price controls from the government, which is a long-shot to start, then I think it\u2019s likely the industry can negotiate a compromise that still maintains solid profits while moderating price increases.\nManagement has identified over $300 million in cost savings it can drive this year and next which could rocket free cash flow. Shares pay a 3.8% dividend yield and the payout has grown at an 8% annualized clip over the last five years.\nAnalysts are only expecting 2.4% earnings growth to $5.10 per share over the next year but the company has a history of thrashing expectations. Over the last two years, management has surprised on the upside by 14% over expectations with even stronger results lately. Even the estimate though puts the shares at 10-times earnings so definitely some value in this one.\nFinding stocks to buy now isn\u2019t the only question you need to ask as investor. It\u2019s just as important to find the investments that will not only grow your money but the companies that will be around when you retire. Use a few basic screens and analysis to find these forever stocks to invest your money and have the confidence that it will be there when you need it.",

    "text": "Chief Servant Adama Barrow just concluded his two-week long meet the people\u2019s tour where he made several promises. Reading various media reports I got to understand that these promises form part of 42 projects that are identified under his National Development Plan.\nSince the days of Jawara and then Yaya Jammeh we have these presidential countrywide tours where numerous promises are made. In most cases these promises are not fulfilled but get repeated at every tour.\nThis trend has to stop. But if only citizens begin to actively identify these promises in order to track their implementation.\nCitizens in each and every village, town, ward, district or region must begin to list these promises made to them so that after the tour they start the process of following up with the relevant Government institutions as well as their National Assembly Member and Local Government Chairperson, Governor and Mayor to ensure that the promises that the Chief Servant gave them are fulfilled.\nThis is the only way we will end the usual practice of empty promises imposed on citizens by politicians. This is the only way we will make our presidents honest and effective. This is the only way citizens will ensure that no politicians and public officers take them for a ride.\nTherefore, to start that process, I have gone through various media reports to capture some of the promises made by the Chief Servant Adam Barrow and some of his ministers during the tour. I urge you to also go back to those reports to identify which promise was made to your village or town or ward or district or region. We must not let Adama Barrow treat us as how DK Jawara and Yaya Jammeh treated us.\n11. To build fish processing factories and storage facilities in Tanji and Brufut that would create more than 20, 000 jobs. Work to begin 2019.\n15. To make Jarra and Kiang the first to benefit from national electricity roadmap.\n19. Minster of Education Claudiana Cole promised Kombo North a new and accessible senior secondary school for the district if the people can provide land.\n26. A digital register that would register all pregnant women in the country to enable health workers to monitor, respond and send alerts to them.\nWhat was promised to your village or town or region? Find out and start tracking the fulfilment of the promises. Promises, when made, are to be kept and not broken!\nCSOs and NAMs and other stakeholder must also follow up on these promises. Let us help Barrow fulfil his promises!\nAdamas\u2019 track record has so far failed the apt title of \u201cchief servant\u201d after merely one and a half year in office. He is gradually turning into a tyrant, warning would-be protesters about severe consequences Jammeh-style, and demeaning Gambian political activists abroad (I have a problem with the term diasporans, whatever that means). Don\u2019t shy away from the term a dictator in the making, Madi.\nWe are witnessing glaring similarities between Adama and the past FAILED presidents of the republic. That should be a call for more vigilance and scrutiny of all aspects and branches of an administration that is evidently taking us downhill. Nevertheless, expecting any different results from Adama and Ousainou, from that of Dawda and Yaya will be pure insanity.\nMadi keep up the unflinching loyalty to your people and the truth.\nI say jerre jeff, njaraama, abaaraka.",

    "text": "Yoga guru Baba Ramdev Saturday criticised the Congress party for nominating cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar to the Rajya Sabha, calling it a ploy to distract public attention.\n\u201cCongress, which is a sinking ship, denied him (Tendulkar) the Bharat Ratna but is nominating him to the Rajya Sabha as a tactic to distract the media and people from issues such as black money and corruption,\u201d said Ramdev at a press conference here.\n\u201cIf inducting cricketers and celebrities in parliament can bring back black money back into the country, I request the people in power to induct every cricketer and celebrity,\u201d he said.\nHe claimed that political pressure was being put on Tendulkar from several quarters to accept the nomination.\nOn his decision to join hands with activist Anna Hazare to fight corruption, Ramdev said \u201cpolitical forces\u201d were questioning his decision.\n\u201cSome corrupt corporates and political leaders are not comfortable with us coming together. So, they keep questioning our unity,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNeither Anna Hazare nor me claimed that we were going to unite our two campaigns. But we\u2019ll keep coming together whenever needed just like we have planned for June 3,\u201d he said.\nRamdev said there was no rift between him and Hazare, and that their \u201cfrequencies matched\u201d.\nHe said just and equitable institutions needed to be put in place of corrupt institutions. For this, he would keep a fast along with Hazare at Jantar Mantar on June 3.\nDuring the press meet, Ramdev also announced his itinerary for the thrid part of his Bharat Swabhiman Yatra. He said the journey would start May 1 and end June 3 with the fast at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.\n\u201cDuring the \u2018yatra,\u2019 people in power will try to malign me, which is expected. But when that happens, I request the media to also hear our side of the story so that the complete picture can come out in the public,\u201d he said.\nAfter a gap of six months portals of famous Himalayan shrine Kedarnath today reopened for pilgrims. The temple, situated in Rudraprayag district at a height of 3,584 meter, was reopened at 0715 hours in the morning according to \u2018mahurat\u2019, sources said.\nThe \u2018mahurat\u2019 was decided on Mahashivrati at Ukhimath area on February 20. The head priest of the temple, Rawal, performed the \u2018Abhishek\u2019 after openeing of the doors, sources said. Thousands of pilgrims flocked the temple after opening of the doors.\nThe Chardhams, comprising the shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri in Garhwal Himalayas reopen for pilgrims in April-May every year after remaining closed for nearly six months during winters as the area remain snow-bound during the period. The annual Chardham yatra is considered as a backbone of the thriving religious tourism in the state that attracts nearly 15-16 lakh pilgrims every year from home and abroad.\nDelhi\u2019s anti-corruption ombudsman Manmohan Sarin today advocated the need for social boycott of the corrupt and rued the \u201cindifference\u201d of the silent majority towards the menace.\n\u201cUnless people condemn, despise, and excommunicate the dishonest, the corrupt will continue to enjoy status and respect in society\u201d, Sarin said speaking at the launch of \u2018Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre Helpline\u2019 by Transparency International India.\n\u201cThe indifference of silent majority is the real cause of corruption. Till you are not personally affected by corruption, you look the other way\u201d, he said. The Lokayukta lamented that complicated laws and lengthy judicial procedures help the corrupt to go scot free.\n\u201cCorrupt people go scot free due to long time of trial and I have no hesitation in saying that the truth is that people with money get away\u201d, he said. \u201cLaws are complicated and are not citizen friendly which gives an opportunity to authorities for corrupt practises\u201d, he said. He asked the media to run a sustained campaign against corruption. \u201cThe media should not stop at just one report.\nIt has to be a sustained campaign against wrong. It is the duty of media\u201d, he said. Advocating administrative and financial autonomy for Lokayukta office, he said that in states where the Chief Minister is not included under Lokayukta, the Lokayukta does not face any problem. \u201cStates where the Chief Minister does not come under Lokayukta Act, there is no problem faced by the Lokayukta\u201d, he said.\nHe said that instilling moral and ethical values in people at young age can help in tackling corruption. \u201cThe fall in moral values in society is also to be blamed for rising corruption.\nWe should catch people young and give them moral and ethical values\u201d, he said. The toll free helpline number of \u2018Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre\u2019 by Transparency International India will inform citizen about their legal rights, provide legal assistance and equip them to take action on cases of corruption that they have been victims of.\n\u201cA victim of corruption can call our helpline and take legal advice from our lawyer. After that if they need any assistance in drafting complaint and approaching the right department, our team will help them\u201d, P S Bawa, Chairman Transparency International India said. Transparency International India is the accredited India chapter of the international civil society organisation based in Berlin.\nMegastar Amitabh Bachchan today said that actress Rekha and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar \u201cdeserved\u201d to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha.\n\u201cIn each session of Parliament, President nominates few set of people for Rajya Sabha from the fields of art, film etc.\nIt is an honorary position. Whoever nominated for this (Rajya Sabha) are deserving people (sic),\u201d Big B told reporters at an event held for promotion of his soon-to-be-released film, \u2018Department\u2019. \u201cI remember even (actress) Nargisji was nominated for Rajya Sabha,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the nomination of the maestro to the Upper House seems to have not gone down well with actor Sanjay Dutt. \u201cIt is an honour to be in Rajya Sabha. I am a die-hard fan of Sachin\u2026he is a pride\u2026jewel of India. But I am not happy that he is a Rajya Sabha member\u2026.he should have been the way he is,\u201d Dutt said.\nWhen asked if being a parliamentarian will be too demanding for Rekha and Sachin, Bachchan said, \u201cIt is their personal decision\u2026leave it to them\u201d. Meanwhile, filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma, who was also present on the occasion, evaded direct reply on the issue, saying, \u201cI have no idea about cricket and politics\u201d.\nISRO has said the indigenously built Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1), launched on April 26, has been placed in its final Polar Sun-synchronous Orbit of 536 km height.\n\u201cPSLV-C19 had placed RISAT-1 in a polar orbit of 470 km X 480 km. As planned, on April 27-28, the satellite propulsion system was used in four orbital manoeuvres to raise the height of the orbit of RISAT-1 to 536 km,\u201d ISRO said in a statement here.\nThe satellite is now in its final orbital configuration and in good health. In the coming days, various elements of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar will be tested and calibrated as a prelude to payload operations, it said.\n\u201cAs compared to the optical remote sensing satellites that depend upon sunlight, the Synthetic Aperture Radar of RISAT-1 transmits its own radar pulses (at 5.35 GHz) to study the objects on Earth. This facilitates (i) cloud penetration and (ii) imaging even without sunlight. For RISAT-1, imaging sessions around both 6 AM and 6 PM have been chosen,\u201d it said.\nThe 1,858 kg RISAT-1, whose images will facilitate agriculture and disaster management, was launched on board the PSLV-C19 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, around 90 km from Chennai.\nThe Amnesty International has appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take steps for immediate release of all protesters arrested in connection with the anti-Koodankulam Nuclear plant agitation and drop \u201cfalse\u201d charges against them.\nAmnesty International members also referred to S.P.Udhayakumar, PMANE convenor\u2019s charge that the Indian authorities had \u201cfailed\u201d to respond satisfactorily to several site and safety concerns raised by an independent group of experts.\nThey expressed \u201cdismay\u201d that officials belonging to the Home Ministry searched Udhayakumar\u2019s home and that police had \u201charassed\u201d shop-keepers who were in solidarity with the protesters.\n\u201cThe charges against the protesters constitute a deliberate attempt by the authorities to silence them despite the fact that the protests had been peaceful,\u201d the letter to the Prime Minister said.\nAmnesty International members who have signed the letter include senior functionary Peter Cattan of Switzerland. A copy of the letter was released to the press here today.\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh Saturday hinted at an impending hike in fuel prices saying that there is need for such an exercise to balance the effects of the spiralling oil import bill.\n\u201cWith imports accounting for about 80 percent of our crude supplies, the spiralling prices of crude in the international market have put a severe strain on our import bill,\u201d Singh said in a speech while inaugurating a refinery here.\n\u201cWe also need to rationalize prices and at the same time ensure that the poor and needy are shielded from the effects of such a rationalization,\u201d he said.\nThe prime minister\u2019s comments came in the wake of demands by oil marketing companies (OMCs) which say they either be allowed to raise petrol prices or the government should compensate them for the underrecoveries. The OMCs say their inability to raise prices from Dec 16, 2011 to March 31, 2012 has resulted in total under-recovery of Rs.2,287 crore.\n\u201cThe challenges we face on the energy front are formidable. We need adequate supplies of energy at affordable prices. Domestic sources of crude oil and gas are inadequate to meet the growing demands of our rapidly expanding economy,\u201d he said.\nIndia also needed to conserve energy and there was \u201cno room for inefficient and wasteful usage of fuel\u201d, said the prime minister.\nThe 60 Years of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s reign will be celebrated in Britain with Rajasthani touch.\nThe 11-member Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band will perform in London June 2 and 3 rubbing shoulders with famous artists like Elton John in presence of heads of several states and world renowned personalities.\n\u201cThe organising committee of these events examined our previous international performances over the past ten years and selected the Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band to perform at London,\u201d the band\u2019s group leader Amrit Hussain said.\n\u201cIt is a very big event and we are unable to express our happiness in words. We expect to enthrall the audience and our aim is to give a taste of Indian music to the international audience with Indian and Rajasthani traditional music with a mix of Western instruments,\u201d he added.\nThe band will use a mix of traditional Indian and Western instruments to perform popular Bollywood, jazz, pop and self-composed music, making it the first group from India to perform at such an event, Hussain claimed.\nHe said over the past nine years, the band has performed at about 600 concerts in 40 countries. It has participated in prestigious music festivals like Sziget (Hungary), Paleo (Switzerland), and Pori Jazz Fest (Finland).\nOriginating from Jaipur, the city of the maharajas, the band consists of seven to eight musicians, a female traditional Rajasthani dancer and a juggler or fire eater. They play a range of traditional brass instruments, including trumpets, trombones, tubas, clarinets, tabla, base drum and saxophones and perform traditional dances.\nAmrit said that roots of the Indian brass band music go deep into the subcontinent\u2019s colonial past.\n\u201cIntroduced in the middle of the 18th century by the British, thousands of brass bands play at carnivals, national or religious festivals and local marriage celebrations across the country. In Rajasthan alone, there are over 2,000 brass bands performing regularly,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe have tried to include in our team the best performers out of the 2,000-odd brass bands,\u201d he added.\nIn a move to curb corruption in government offices, Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda has given his consent to an ordinance to set up special courts which will have the power to seize/attach properties of corrupt officials.\n\u201cChief Minister Munda has given his approval to set up \u2018Jharkhand special court ordinance 2012\u2032. The ordinance has been sent to the governor for notification,\u201d an official of the Chief Minister\u2019s Office (CMO) told IANS Saturday.\nThe special courts will issue notices within 30 days of the petition against the tainted officers.\nTo fight corruption in government offices, Jharkhand has already formulated the Right to Services Act and the Electronic Delivery Services Act.\nIndia\u2019s nominee, Justice Dalveer Bhandari, a sitting judge of the Supreme Court, has been elected to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the first time an Indian has managed to get this key international post in over two decades.\nBhandari secured 122 votes in the United Nations General Assembly against 58 for his Filipino rival, Syed Akbaruddin, the spokesperson of the external affairs, said here.\nIn simultaneous elections Friday at the UN headquarters in New York, Bhandari also secured an absolute majority in the Security Council.\nIn the election to the ICJ, a primary judicial organ of the United Nations, commonly referred to as the World Court, Bhandari was locked in a fierce contest with Justice Florentino P. Feliciano of the Philippines.\nBhadari takes the place of Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh of Jordan who resigned from the Asia-Pacific region seat at the end of 2011.\nAn eminent legal luminary, Bhandari will serve the remainder of the term 2012-18. India was last represented at the ICJ more than two decades ago.\nThe 64-year-old Justice Bhandari has variegated experience in international law and is well-versed with the working of the UN. Bhandari has been on India\u2019s apex court since 2005 and has served in the higher Indian judiciary for over two decades. He will retire in September this year. He served as the chairperson of the Delhi Centre of the International Law Association for several years.\nBhandari is also a member of leading international academic and legal bodies and is closely associated with a large number of committees dealing with various aspects of international law such as: human rights, biotechnology, sustainable development, securities regulation, trade, nuclear weapons, non-proliferation and contemporary international law and space.\nAcknowledging his outstanding contribution, the Northwestern University School of Law, Chicago, US while celebrating its 150 Years (1859-2009) selected Bhandari as one of its 16 most illustrious and distinguished alumni.\nIn New Delhi, the Supreme Court Thursday had refused to quash Bhandari\u2019s nomination as a judge for the ICJ.\nEstablished in June 1945 by the charter of the United Nations, in The Hague, Netherlands, ICJ\u2019s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorised United Nations organs and specialised agencies.",

    "text": "Western Sahara is on the Atlantic coast of north-west Africa, between Morocco to the north and Mauritania to the south and east and Algeria to the north-east.\nThe area of Western Sahara is 266,000 sq km of which 180,000 sq km (68%) is occupied by Morocco and 86,000 sq km (32%) is controlled by SADR, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic.\nIn the eighties Morocco divided the territory with a 1,800 km wall or berm made of sand, stone, landmines and barbed wire. The wall is watched over by radars, artillery, and air force, and is protected by 160,000 armed soldiers. Another 920 km of walls have been built inside the occupied area.\nWestern Sahara is rich in mineral resources, including phosphate mineral rock which Australia imports contrary to international law. Western Sahara has one of the best fishing grounds in the world. Currently its off-shore oil resources are being explored.\nMorocco invaded Western Sahara in 1975 when Spain abandoned its former colony. Mauritania seized part of the land, but soon made peace with the Polisario Front, the Saharawi people\u2019s political organisation, which continued the fight against Morocco.\nMany Saharawis fled the tanks and aerial bombardments of napalm and cluster bombs of the Moroccan invaders and set up refugee camps near Tindouf in south-west Algeria where more than 165,000 of them now live supported by the UN Food Program and other humanitarian aid.\nThose who remained in their homeland have constantly faced arrest, imprisonment, death and \u201cdisappearance\u201d at the hands of Moroccan occupying forces. Their escape is blocked by a 2,400km wall dividing Western Sahara into the coastal zone occupied by Morocco and the interior part held by the Polisario Front.\nIn 1975 the International Court of Justice held that Western Sahara was not terra nullius at the time of its colonisation by Spain and that neither Morocco nor Mauritania had sovereignty over it at that time.\nThe war between Morocco and the Polisario continued until an UN-African Union brokered a ceasefire in 1991.\nThe UN has arrangements in place for a referendum of self-determination of the Saharawi people but Morocco refused to allow the referendum to be held.\nWhile life is scarcely viable in the harsh Hamada desert where the refugees live, as there are no means for self sufficiency, the Saharawis living in occupied Western Sahara suffer the terrible oppression already noted.\nMINURSO was established to organise a referendum for self-determination of the Saharawi people in 1992 as part of peace process between Morocco and Polisario.\nBy 1996 the peace process was in stalemate.\nIn 1997, James Baker (George H. Bush\u2019s Secretary of State) became a UN envoy and drew up a new plan for the referendum, the Framework agreement on the Status of Western Sahara. Morocco refused to co-operate.\nIn 2003 Baker made a new plan, known as Baker Plan II \u2013 Peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. This was accepted by the UN and the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Morocco still refuses to allow UN sponsored referendum to take place.\nSince May 2005, there has been an increase in this oppression. Peaceful demonstrations have been brutally put down. Many Saharawis have been arrested and imprisoned. Some have been tortured and some have \u201cdisappeared\u201d. Women and children have been assaulted in their own homes and their property stolen by Moroccan police and soldiers. Outsiders, including parliamentarians from the European Union, Spain and Norway have been refused entry to Western Sahara. So have human rights bodies from Norway and elsewhere.\nThe Saharawis have their own democratically elected government, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), with men and women ministers and parliamentarians. Its officials run the camps. SADR is recognised as the legitimate government of Western Sahara by at least 80 countries, most recently by the Republic of South Africa and Kenya. It is a member of the African Union.\nIn May 2005 in preparation for the full recovery of all of the Western Sahara territory SADR announced the commencement of a licensing initiative to enable international oil and gas companies to participate in the exploration of its offshore territory.\nThis licensing initiative is open to all competent and qualified companies and has been arranged in accordance with the UN legal opinion regarding commercial activities in Western Sahara.\nSADR believes that development of its significant natural resources will play an important part in developing a self-reliant, democratic and progressive nation in Western Sahara.\nThe present situation cannot continue. The oppression of the Saharawis in occupied Western Sahara must stop. The refugees in the camps must feel safe to return to their own country after the referendum to be ruled by a government that they elect directly.\nThe UN, the African Union, the European Union and nations individually must act to ensure that Morocco no longer precludes the referendum on self-determination for the Saharawi people from taking place.\nThe Saharawi people must be allowed to determine their own future through a free and fair UN sponsored referendum.",

    "text": "Alphitonia blossom Red Ashis derived from the Greek \u03b1\u03bb\u03c6\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd (alphiton), barley meal, and refers to the dry, mealy quality of the mesocarp in the fruits; excelsa is from the Latin excelsus, elevated, high.\nThe Red Ash grows in eucalypt forests, eucalypt and acacia savannas, gallery forests and rainforests of NSW from Mt Dromedary northwards along the coast through Queensland and the Northern Territory, into the northwest of Western Australia. It is also found in New Guinea and on some of the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium tree, up to about 20 m tall, is a natural colonizer or pioneer in a huge range of conditions, and can sometimes regenerate from underground stems. It has a spreading, shade-producing habit where it is able to grow into a large tree, and has an overall greyish green appearance.\ndetail of blossom blossom, fruits formingThe trunk and larger branches have fissured grey bark, with smaller branches having smoother grey or white bark. Lichens are often found on older specimens. The entire, simple, alternate leaves are 5 \u2013 14 cm in length and 2 \u2013 5 cm in width, elliptic in shape, and are dark glossy green above and silvery with fine hairs underneath, making an attractive contrast on windy days. Venation is prominent and yellowish below, and sunken above. In the dry season, many of the leaves are shed, and the remaining leaves hang vertically to reduce water loss. The tree bears small greenish white 5-petalled flowers in late autumn and early winter, followed by globular dark fruit about 1.5 cm in diameter, with a raised ring around the middle. The powdery red flesh of the drupe covers 2 hard cells, each containing a single seed. Seeds can persist on the branches for several months. When young shoots are bruised, they give off a typical odour of sarsaparilla. The flowers are fragrant in the evening.\nfruits ripe fruits When grown under cultivation, this is quite a quick-growing tree, and can have high visual appeal, especially as a street tree. Its tough timber is light brown to reddish in colour, and has been used in boat building and cabinet-making, particularly in Samoa, where the tree is known as toi.\nmature fruits Aborigines used the crushed leaves and berries as a fish poison. For medical use, they crushed the leaves into a paste, mixed that with water and applied it as a head bath to reduce headaches and treat sore eyes. Infusions of the bark and root were rubbed on the body to reduce muscular ache, and gargled to cure toothache. The leaves contain saponin, and so when crushed can be lathered to produce a bush soap. In Borneo, the sap from under the bark is collected, and used to treat skin diseases by mixing it in the bath water.",

    "text": "January 27 - Samuel and I were feeling a little sentimental about not seeing each other for four days, so we decided to do something fun together and bake cookies for him and Scott to eat while I\u2019m gone. I told him what ingredients to add, but he made them almost completely by himself! Now if only I hadn\u2019t burned half the cookies\u2026 My activity idea must have worked, though, because he later asked me if I would leave after his nap today instead of tomorrow morning.\nJanuary 26 - This coming weekend, I\u2019m meeting a friend of mine in a mutually adjoining state for a fun weekend of scrapbooking and girl time! I\u2019m horribly behind on my scrapbooking and am determined to make the most of this opportunity. 250+ pictures, 28 layouts, 60 pages, and countless pieces of paper later, I am ready.\nJanuary 25 \u2013 Samuel and I spent some time coloring trains this afternoon (his latest passion).\nJanuary 24 \u2013 I found Kaelynn today reading to her baby doll.\nJanuary 23 \u2013 We took the kids to a friend\u2019s birthday party today. It was a cooking theme! The kids made little pizzas, fruit snowmen, and \u201cdirt\u201d (Oreos with gummy worms and Cool Whip). The family had made personalized aprons and hats for each of the kids! Samuel and Kaelynn had a blast! Hands down, the coolest kid\u2019s birthday party I have attended.\nI must have drooled over the idea of play silks for several years. I love the concept and the endless creative play possibilities that they offer. But the standard size silks (35\u2033x35\u2033) sell for $10-12/each, making a small set cost a small fortune. That didn\u2019t even account for my dream of a bigger play silk collection that included multiple sizes.\n1. Order play silks in the sizes you want. I chose a half dozen 35\u2033x35\u2033 silks this time, but I have plans to expand our collection someday with various sizes. I bought mine from Dharma Trading Company for $3.75/each.\n2. Bring a pot of water to boiling. Add a cup of vinegar and remove from heat. Soak all the silks for about an hour before dying.\n3. Put on a pair of plastic gloves. Mix 3 cups of hot water, 1/2 c vinegar, and 2-3 packets of Kool-Aid (see the note at the bottom of post for a Kool-Aid color guide). Immerse a silk in the colored water and stir slightly until fully immersed. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes. Remove and stir again. Cover and microwave for 3 more minutes. Repeat the cycle a third time.\n4. Remove silk from the bowl and rinse with soap and water until the water runs clear.\nKeep dyed, wet silks separate until they are dry. They can bleed onto each other (voice of experience speaking).\n5. Dry on low in the dryer. Iron.\nRed \u2013 Strawberry, Cherry, or Black Cherry (Note: I wanted more of a salmon/dark pink color, so I just used two packages of Strawberry. A combination of Cherry and Black Cherry will get you the truest red.\nJanuary 22 \u2013 Eating blueberries.",

    "text": "Java might be the grandaddy of them all, but there are new kids on the block. Let's see what makes Scala and Kotlin great, frustrating, and how they compare to Java.\nSince the arrival and maturity of Kotlin, JVM-based languages face quite a challenge, most particularly Scala. You must have heard a lot about Kotlin by now, especially the perks and treats it brings to the Java table. But then there is Scala, a powerful and concise Java alternative. Scala vs Kotlin? Which one is better? Or maybe it's Kotlin vs. Java or Java vs. Scala?\nScala and Kotlin aim to better Java in their own different ways.\nTo those of you planning to shift from Java to either Kotlin or Scala (can't imagine it the other way around), I am going to paint a \"what's what\" scenario so you can decide better for yourself.\nLet's look at Kotlin first.\nKotlin was developed by JetBrains and reached the market in Feb. 2012 as an open source language. Up until now, Kotlin has had two released versions, with Kotlin 1.2 being the most stable version, released Nov. 28, 2017.\nThe language grew in popularity on Android because of its perfect compatibility with Java 6, which is mainly the present version of Java on Android. Not just that, Kotlin offers some features that are only in Java 8, and are thus not available to Android developers on Java 6.\nIn the closet full of 'All that is good about Kotlin,' the two most prominent qualities of Kotlin entail seamless and flawless interoperability with Java. You can call Java code from Kotlin and vice versa without any hiccups or frowns, not to mention the in-built null safety feature. Not seeing a NullPointerException is every Android programmer\u2019s dream.\nAndroid app development is completely transformed into a blissful, non-NPE experience. If you want some detail as to how the null safety works, check it out here.\nThat is also one of the 'why's' for Google adopting Kotlin on Android as an officially supported language.\nApart from that, take a look at some of the strengths Kotlin has to offer.\nAny Java competitor has to be an FP language. Kotlin lacks a little on the higher-kinded types and type safety, but nonetheless, it offers all the features of an OOP style language with an FP approach.\nThis is my favorite part. Java is great, but the boilerplate code it makes you write is just frustrating and error-prone. Coding in Kotlin is very short, concise, and to the point. Get the job done with fewer lines of code than in Java. The less you have to write, the less often you make errors and expose yourself to bugs. Everyone knows that, right?\nOne way Kotlin reduces the amount of code is by limiting the use of findViewById.\nKotlin allows views to be accessed from the layout XML, just like you would properties. Instead of using findViewById every time, all you have to do is follow this example.\nAlthough Kotlin is a younger language than Scala, it has the support of two great companies: the formidable Google and the amazing JetBrains, who are responsible for many other IDEs, including the IntelliJ IDE for Android. So there is no doubt about great tooling support there. To all the people who thought of Kotlin as some trend, you could not be more wrong.\nKotlin is already on Android and it is definitely here to stay, grow, and evolve.\nBut with strength comes some weakness as well.\nPattern matching is not strong in Kotlin. It doesn\u2019t fully support it.\n...that would be a no. But it's no frowner. You can still do a pretty fine pattern matching job by intelligently using the when clause. But we all know that intelligence takes a little more effort and skills than your average Joe.\nIf your applications are already long, then the extra runtime size of 800KB could be a problem for you. You might experience a dwindling number of downloads because of the bigger size of an application.\nNothing is ever all good. With the concise approach Kotlin offers, there is a little problem. With so much going on in so little code, it becomes a little hard to read and understand at first. It might even feel overwhelming to a beginner.\nAlthough Google has joined hands with JetBrains to offer support for Kotlin, it is pivotal to know that Google does not endorse it. Even when you use Kotlin in Android, the autocorrect occurs slower than it does for Java.\nAs I already mentioned, Kotlin is younger than Scala and, needless to say, Java.\nSince Kotlin is younger than Scala, it has fewer libraries, blog posts, and tutorials.\nThe online support community is quite small. The lack of blog posts, tutorials, and user documentation might become a problem for you, but as trends suggest, this might be filled up soon as more and more people and companies are adopting Kotlin.\nBefore you make up your mind, let's hop over to Scala.\nScala surfaced to the general public in the year 2004. Developed by Martin Odersky, Scala was released on the Java platform as a general-purpose programming language. The name Scala is not some whimsical notion, it is an abbreviation of \"scalable\": a language that is scalable according to the needs of its users.\nBeing released in 2004 sure gave Scala the advantage of maturing more over time and taking the spotlight from Kotlin.\nScala has some common features with Kotlin like conciseness of code, higher-order functions, FP functionality with an OOP style, and interoperability with Java (though not as good as Kotlin). Other than that, here is what Scala is about.\nPattern matching in Scala is no joke. Scala uses the match statement for this purpose, which is a powerful version of Java's switch statement. It allows you to match on any type of data, lists, and even your own types. If you haven't already tried it, I suggest you play around with it a little.\nScala is a little complex, but it has a very flexible code syntax. The proficient use of functional programming features makes the code extensible and hierarchical to the very best level.\nScala has been here for more than a decade. Since it is a powerful Java alternative, it has huge support community. We're talking about YouTube tutorials, blog posts, forums, and let's not forget the official support and user documentation. Anything you find yourself struggling with, you can pretty much find the answer to it.\nScala does not restrict you from overloading operators. You can play with operator-looking functions and define limitlessly. But you need to be careful with this feature. Still, if you can do this right, your code readability will increase. If not, you might end up making your code difficult to understand.\nEverything is about speed in the world of coding. A slow program is a big turn-off. When it comes to industry-grade projects, Scala's compile time turns into minutes as compared to Kotlin, which tries to compile as fast as Java, which is in seconds.\nScala is not binary compatible with a few versions. Let's say you compiled with Scala 2.1. The same will not compile with Scala 2.11.\nThat could be nothing, or it could be your biggest nightmare if you have to work across different versions and update them. Especially if you have production-scale projects.\nScala attempts a good take on managing null safety, but it's just not as effective. The Scala equivalent for null safety is the Option keyword. Using this, there is a considerable chance you might get an NPE at the back door.\nScala and Kotlin are in quite a tug of war. Scala has the edge over Kotlin in some ways, but Kotlin is just as formidable in others. The main differences \u2014 where the two languages set themselves apart \u2014 is that Kotlin is more like a better version of Java, while Scala is an entirely different kind of Java, so to speak.\nWhile Scala has a bit of a learning curve, it offers unparalleled support for advanced functional programming. Kotlin, on the other hand, is super easy to learn and fun to code in.\nBut does that mean something is wrong with Java? I mean why change from Java in the first place?\nJava is old. Really old. Like, great-grandpa old. And while popular, its popularity actually works against it. Java use is everywhere, which makes it impossible for teams using Java to change their fundamentals, even knowing that Java is facing a lot of technical criticism as well.\nNo matter the greatness, Java has too much redundancy and lengthy boilerplate code. Kotlin and Scala just happen to be better at what Java was intended for.\nChoosing the language primarily depends on the use you need it for. Scala is a good fit for projects with a need for a mix of functional and OOP style programming languages. For places where you need to handle large amounts of data or complex modeling reliant on mathematics, Scala would be best.\nHowever, if you just wanted Java to be less frustrating \u2014 but still be Java \u2014 then there is nothing better than Kotlin out there. Using Kotlin for Android app development will be the best thing that ever happened to you. Kotlin is like a Java cousin with better looks and who doesn\u2019t talk gibberish. So choose wisely and may the code-Force be with you.",

    "text": "1. Why choose shutters? Shutters bring style & sophistication to any window & are equally at home in both traditional & modern interiors. They last longer than curtains, as fabrics begin to break down as soon as they are exposed to sunlight, require periodic washing & harbour dust mites. Shutters offer a level of light control unmatched by any blind, as the louvres within each panel can be independently adjusted to temper the degree of light entering the room. If the sun is in your eye, you can simply close the louvres on one panel & let the light flood into the room though the others. On dark days, the panels can be folded back to expose the window & maximise the light.\n2. Why choose Made for Shade? We're the Midlands' longest established, most trusted shutter company & have been fitting shutters since 1999, so we know shutters inside out. Experience has taught us that clients generally want three things - the best product, at the best price, with the best service. (John Ruskin famously said that this combination was not achievable & that one of the three had to give - We prove otherwise!). Additionally, for your added peace of mind, we're full members of the Guild of Master Craftsmen (membership number A121256) - your guarantee of a top-quality product & installation.\n3. How does the quality of your shutters compare to that of your competitors? Our shutters are manufactured by the world-leader in shutter production, utilising a combination of state of the art manufacturing & hand-crafted finishing touches. The wood used for our hardwood shutters is stored for six months before kiln drying to allow the wood to settle before being treated. UNLIKE the majority of shutter manufacturers our wood is kiln dried twice in a computer controlled drying facility. The wood is specifically dried to take into account the climate of the country to which the shutters will be exported. This is very important as these shutters are manufactured for installation in climates as varied as Alaska & Australia. By utilising these methods, frame warping is greatly reduced. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we engineer our stiles (the vertical, side bars of the shutter panels), rather than producing these as solid profiles. We cut the wood into strips which are then bonded back together in opposing layers for greater strength. This has the effect of breaking the capillaries that run through the wood, through which moisture travels. This, together with the strength of the bonding agent, ensures our panels are unlikely to warp & will give customers years of enjoyment. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we use mortise & tenon joints between the cross rails and the side stiles. These are far stronger than dowel joints & minimise movement between profiles. Movement can result in cracking of the paint or stain finish, which will spoil the aesthetic appearance of the shutters. Again, just in case there is some movement, we engineer the panels with an additional grooved overlap that ensures any movement is handled by this expansion joint. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we use a high quality, proprietary paint system developed specifically for our shutters. Cheaper shutters use cheaper paints & stains and have fewer coats. We apply six coats of paint or stain, the final layer of which is a clear lacquer with a UV additive to ensure that the shutters are less susceptible to fading and yellowing. UNLIKE other manufacturers we don't compromise on the thickness of our louvres as we believe thinner louvres, although less costly to produce, are much more susceptible to warping. UNLIKE other manufacturers, we use the best quality, marine-grade stainless steel staples to attach our tilt rods to our shutters. In addition, the tips of the staples are coated in a bonding agent to make sure they remain secure for years to come. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we supply our shutters with a large choice of frames rather than attaching them to battens. Not only does this give you the choice of framing your window by selecting a frame design to co-ordinate with your decor, but it also offers a practical solution for awkward windows (inward opening, etc). UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we assemble our shutters prior to shipping to ensure that all the components fit together perfectly. Once photographed, the shutters are disassembled & packed into custom made packaging to ensure they arrive in perfect condition. When shipping by airfreight, we double pack the shutters for additional security. All this means we are able to provide a three-year warranty on all shutters built within our published specifications. There are inferior quality shutters available on the market, but why would you pay more to get less?\n4. Which areas do you cover? We're based in Sutton Coldfield & cover the West Midlands, East Midlands, Staffordshire, Warwickshire & Herefordshire regions. We also cover the 'M1 corridor' (the area between the M1 & the M40 between London & Birmingham).\n5. Do you actually make the shutters? Like 99% of UK shutter companies, the answer is 'no'. Made for Shade is the Midlands agent for our manufacturer S:Craft (based near Winchester), who are the shutter market leaders in terms of quality, choice & product innovation. Our expertise is in designing, surveying, specifying & installing shutters, not making them. This enables us to offer a far greater choice of materials, colours, louvre widths & framing options & guarantees clients a constant timeframe from ordering to installation. That said, we have joinery workshop facilities for customising special shutters & have been regular visitors to the factory where the shutters are manufactured. This means we can talk in detail about the production process & answer any questions you may have.\n6. Who will measure & fit my shutters? Made for Shade is a family business & as such, we don't employ sales people or believe in pressure selling. We operate a he / she who surveys also fits policy whenever possible, to maintain continuity throughout the order process. Acurate dimensions will be taken at the time of the design consultation to save disturbing you further. Our aim is to make the process of buying shutters a pleasure from start to finish & our testimonials certainly bare this out as you may have already seen.\n7. How long do I have to wait? Standard delivery time is between six & eight weeks. Special shapes take an additional two weeks, as CAD drawings need to be created & signed off before manufacture can commence. Custom coloured shutters also take an additional two weeks. However, if you need your shutters fitted sooner, we also offer an express service, which reduces the waiting time to between three & four weeks, but naturally costs a little more.\n8. How long do they take to fit? This really depends upon the size & quantity of the shutters & what they're being fitted to (wooden window frames are quicker to fit to than plastered reveals), however most jobs are completed within half a day. Naturally, we can give you an accurate time frame before you place your order.\n9. How are they fitted? All Made for Shade shutters are fitted using a three-sided or four-sided perimeter frame, from which the panels are then hinged. Frames can be fitted inside the recess, outside the recess or around the front edge of the recess, depending on how & where you want your panels to fold when open. Needless to say, there are different frame profiles for every eventuality. (The latter option is perfect for uneven recesses, as the run-out is hidden behind the frame moulding). Whichever framing option you choose, all screw-heads will be either hidden with insert strips or cap covers & in the case of stained finishes, screws will be fitted using brass or silver mounting cups. For wider installations such as patio doors & room dividers, tracking systems are used as they give constant support to the panels as they move. All panels are fitted within their frames using hinges with removable pins, which are perfect when it comes to decorating, as the panels can be simply removed & re-fitted in a matter of minutes.\n10. How & when do I pay? Payment is made in two parts, 50% when the order is placed & the remaining 50% on completion of installation. Payment can be made by cash, cheque, debit card or credit card (all major cards accepted).\n11. What are shutters made from? Made for Shade offer seven different shutter materials. The most economical option is Craftwood, which is a Polymer coated MDF product available in the six best selling white / cream shades & comes in a choice of four louvre widths. It's perfect for small to average sized installations & looked just like a wooden, painted shutter when fitted. We then have a variety of real timbers including Larchwood, Basswood & Cedarwood, each of which have their own unique grain patterns & characteristics. Using lighter weight timbers allows us to hinge more panels together to achieve greater widths with a single, conventional bi-folding shutter. Real timbers can have painted or stained finishes, but our Western Red Cedarwood can also be oiled to give it a beautifully natural finish, which brings out the individually different grain structure in each profile to give a truly rustic charm.\n12. How much light do they cut out? There are no technical figures to quote here but we estimate that a shutter will cut out 90 - 95% of incoming light. Whilst there are no gaps to let in direct light, there will always be light glow around the edges of the panels, between the louvres & between the louvre edges where they meet the stile uprights. If actual blackout is required for bedrooms, we have the perfect solution whereby a cellular pleated blackout blind is built into the shutter frame & positioned behind the panels. The blind is raised / lowered by a simple cord mechanism & cannot be seen through the panels. The blinds are available in several, equally effective colours, the most popular being white.\n13. Can they be fitted to any window? It's a rare day when we come across a window to which we can't fit shutters, but \"never say never\" as the saying goes. We need to ensure that the shutter will not inhibit the opening operation of the window & that we have suitably substantial fixing points to bare the weight, but this is all taken care of during the survey.\n14. What if my window is out of square? This is usually no problem as most windows vary in width & height across the window. If you want your shutters fitted inside the recess, the tolerance gap between the outside edge of the shutter frame & the recess itself, will usually be filled with decorating caulk as this can be painted to match the walls or window frame when dry. It takes approximately half an hour to caulk an average sizes shutter to a high standard, but makes all the difference in the world to the final result. If the window it drastically out of square, we would fill the gaps by scribing insert strips (finished in the same colour as the shutters) to the desired shape & then caulking around them as described earlier. Alternatively, we have framing options which can either be surface mounted outside the recess or fitted to the front edge of the recess with a lip feature that disguises / hides the recess variance. It's simply a case of using the right frame for the right job, which is where our expertise comes into play.\n15. What about shaped windows? No problem. We design & fit round shutters, arched shutters & angled shutters in various materials with either painted or stained finishes. The great thing about shaped shutters is that unlike blinds or curtains, they maintain the true shape of the window rather than \"squaring it off\" & the panels will still hinge open to give access to the window.\n16. What about high-level windows? If shutters are fitted to an out-of-reach window, the tilting of the louvers can be done by remote control (both battery & solar powered units are available). Alternatively, if the shutter is simply to dress the window, the louvers can be simply set in the desired position & left.\n17. How do I clean them? The easiest way is with either a feather duster or using a vacuum upholstery brush (the one with the bristles on). Marks can be removed using a damp cloth with, if necessary, a suitable soap solution.\n18. What if they get damaged? We offer a full repair service whereby, for example, damaged louvers can simply be removed & replaced with new ones.\n19. Does fitting make a mess? This depends on what we're fitting to as drilling into plaster / brick creates dust which drilling into wood doesn't. Whatever the case, we will always dust sheet the fitting area first & clean up thoroughly when we've finished. Installers also wear slippers in carpeted rooms. We are always mindful that we are in your home. We therefore treat your home as we would our own, with respect.\n20. What's the most popular colour? About 75% of our orders are for a white painted finished & there are good reasons for this. (1) White reflects light in a way no other colour will. This means light within the room is maximised as it reflects off the louvres (tip ~ using the medium 64mm or larger 89mm wide louvres also creates more light as the gaps between each louvre increase with louvre size & larger louvre surfaces reflect more light. Food for thought if you have a North facing room with a big tree outside!) (2) White never dates & always looks fresh. (3) White offers endless colour possibilities when it's time to decorate, as white will work with any colour. (4) White will always be relevant as there will always be something else white in the room (window frames, doors, radiators, coving, ceilings, etc). (5) Shutters are an investment in your home & will appeal to prospective, aspirational home buyers if you decide to move on. Buyers can always visualise working their design schemes around white shutters, as it gives them an open book decoratively speaking in addition to the wow factor.\n21. Are they guaranteed? Absolutely! All Made for Shade shutters are guarantee for a minimum of 3 years. This includes all aspect of the shutters (colour fastness & joinery) as well as the installation itself.\n22. Are they suitable for bathrooms & swimming pool areas? This really depends on the level of moisture within the air. In a large, well-ventilated bathroom with no shower, a conventional painted or stain finished shutter will be fine. However, in high moisture rooms such as shower rooms, wet-rooms & swimming pools, we have a purpose made waterproof product called Permawood, which an ABS coated hardwood. Permawood shutters are fitted with marine-grade stainless steel hinges to resist moisture & prevent rusting.\n23. How do I measure? To obtain an initial estimate, firstly decide whether you want your shutters to be fitted inside of outside the recess. Remember if they're fitted inside the recess, the panels will only fold back as far as the recess returns will allow (usually 90 degrees). If they're fitted outside the recess, the panels will fold back onto the walls (provided there is sufficient space for them to do so of course). For inside recess shutters, measure the width & drop in 3 places & tell us the largest dimension in each case. For outside recess shutters, take the same measurements & add 150mm to the recess width to allow for the overlap. If your window has a sill, add 75mm to the recess height or 150mm if it doesn't have a sill, to allow for the overlap. If you're looking to buy Caf\u00e9 Style shutters (to cover the lower part of the window only), take the width dimension in the same way, but then measure from the sill up to where you'd like the top of the shutters to be. For inside recess shutters or outside recess shutters where the window has a sill, that's the height you need to give. For outside recess, Caf\u00e9 Style shutters where the window has no sill, add 75mm to the recorded height. Naturally, we will take accurate dimensions at the point of survey but following this procedure will ensure there are no nasty surprises price-wise!\n24. What are \"Solid\" shutters? These are simply shutters, which have solid panels rather than louvred panels. They were originally fitted into period homes, folding back into purpose made side-recesses when the owners were in residence. When the owners were overseas, the shutters were closed for privacy & security as part of the \"closing up\" of the house. These days, we tend to only install solid shutters when either a greater degree of darkness is required or when replacing original solid shutters in period properties. Naturally, the amount of light entering the room can't be adjusted in the way it can with louvred shutters.\n25. Can I measure & fit my own shutters? Yes. We can measure & fit your shutters for you, we can measure but you can fit or you can measure & fit yourself. It really comes down to the complexity of the particular job & the surface to which the shutters will be fixed. If you're self-measuring, we suggest you e-mail a photograph of the window prior to finalising your order so we can try to spot any potential problems & help you overcome them.\n26. Do operate a 'price promise' pledge? Whilst our aim is to provide shutters at the most competitive price & we constantly monitor the market to check price levels, there may be times when, due to a limited or special promotion, a competitor's price is lower. In such an eventuality, we guarantee to price match any like-for-like, written quotation.\nIf you have a question other than those above, please either call us on 0121-352-0747 or e-mail it to us via our contact page & we'll answer your question by return.",

    "text": "Traditionally, quantum theory has been viewed as a \"difficult\" topic, mainly because of the symbolic-mathematical content. For example, Francl notes that two semesters of calculus is usually required for physical chemistry (1), and this is certainly true for quantum theory. The traditional approach emphases the use of mathematical equations, derivations and calculations. How do we deal with non-chemistry majors who have a weak background in mathematics, but wish to study p-chem? Similarly, how do we deal with chemistry majors who have a weak background in mathematics?\nInterestingly, the last 20-30 years has witnessed a paradigm shift in the practice of quantum chemistry. Leading up to the 1970s, quantum chemistry was monopolized by theoretical chemists, who were as much mathematicians as chemists. One had to be conversant with the mathematical methodology in order to perform a quantum calculation. More recently, the amazing increases in computing power have lead to graphical user interfaces, which has enabled a new group ofcomputational chemists. These computational chemists are interested only in the significance of the computed results, not in the details of the mathematical methods used. However, the same paradigm shift in the teaching of quantum chemistry has not occurred yet: students are still required to be competent mathematicians.\nThe \"new calculus\" in mathematics education (eg, 2) advocates the \"rule of four\" (numerical, graphical, symbolic and verbal descriptions) to deepen students' conceptual understanding (eg, 3). This \"new calculus\" acknowledges that a predominantly symbolic approach to mathematics is suitable for some, but not all, students. The greater emphasis on graphical and verbal descriptions of a \"problem\" enables students to focus on the qualitative results. The numerical approach can refer either to approximate numerical solutions (cf modern computational chemistry software) or to specific numerical examples of more general symbolic equations.\nThis paper describes the use of spreadsheets to generate approximate numerical solutions and visual (graphical) descriptions as a method of avoiding or minimizing symbolic manipulations, mathematical derivations and numerical computation. The aim here is to teach the qualitative results that arise from quantum theory, but with less \"math\". The specific example of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation and some aspects of the educational pedagogy of spreadsheet usage are discussed.\nElectrons (and atoms?) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.\nStudents are usually first introduced to quantum theory through the wavefunctions for the 1-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Exact solutions are derived for the particle-in-a-box (the Kuhn model (4)) and the simple harmonic oscillator model. The shapes of the potentials for these models are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Potential functions for the particle-in-a-box model (left) and the simple harmonic oscillator model (right).\nwhere Hn(x) is the Hermite polynomial of order n. The novice learner sees the differences between Equation 1 and Equation 2 and concludes that every potential is treated as a special case!\nPotentials such has the triangular and stepped-valley models, shown in Figure 2, have no closed-form (ie analytic) wavefunction solutions. Similarly, the quantized energies cannot be given by any analytic equation. Here, the novice learner concludes incorrectly either that quantum mechanics does not apply, or that many systems are not quantized!\nFigure 2. Simple piecewise-continuous potential functions for which the wavefunction does not have any closed form: a triangular potential (left) and a stepped-valley potential (right).\nIn p-chem classes at Deakin University, the derivative is explained as the \"slope of a function\". The 2nd order differential Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron-in-a-box (the Kuhn model (4)) is explained as \"finding the slope of a slope\". The 1st order Euler method for generating numerical solutions is explained. No calculus is required as the Euler method can be derived from the definition of average slope. More-able students can construct an appropriate spreadsheet (to find numerical solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), but mostly, spreadsheet quantum_well.xls<http://www.deakin.edu.au/~lim/KFLim/papers/2003_Spreadsheet_CCEN/quantum_well.xls>, implementing the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is provided as a \"black box\" to weaker students. (The pros and cons of black box methods are discussed below.) Using the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, students test how the shape of a trial \"wavefunction\" changes as the energy is varied (Figure 3). A copy of the instructions to students for this exercise can be found at<http://www.deakin.edu.au/~lim/KFLim/papers/2003_Spreadsheet_CCEN/Asgnt_1_6.pdf>. The wavefunction solutions are classed as \"valid\" or \"invalid\" depending on whether the boundary conditions are satisfied as energy is varied (the shooting method (6)).\nFigure 3. Approximate trial wavefunctions for the triangular potential (Figure 2), arranged from high energy (top) to low energy (bottom). Shaded domains are the forbidden region: V(x) < E.\nStudents discover that energy determines the wavelength of the wavefunction, and that valid solutions require that only special (\"allowed\") wavelengths will fit the dimension of the potential (Figure 3). It is observed that, as wavelength decreases, the number of nodes (the zeroes or roots of the wavefunction) increases with energy. An extension of this exercise using a skipping rope easily verifies that it is more difficult (higher energy) to swing the rope with nodes present than without any nodes (lower energy). Since the sign of the wavefunction changes across a node, the qualitative shape of the wavefunction can be generated from the nodal pattern. (One strategy in de Bono's Lateral Thinking (7) is to concentrate on what is not present - ie the nodes or zeroes - in order to obtain what should be present - the wavefunction.) Wavefunctions can then be generated from nodal patterns in 2-dimensions and 3-dimensions.\nFor example, the molecular orbitals for cyclopentadienyl have, in increasing order of energy, no nodes, one node and two nodes respectively (Figure 4). Similarly, the rotational wavefunctions can be generated by considering nodal patterns on the surface of a sphere. Much of Schr\u00f6dinger's original work was based on Hamilton's mathematical description of standing waves on a planet completely covered by ocean (ie water waves on a spherical surface). Note that these \"spherical waves\" correspond to combinations of the spherical harmonic functions, and can be obtained from the symmetry - \"topology\" - of the nodal patterns on the surface of a sphere.\nFigure 4. molecular orbitals for cyclopentadienyl. Shading of the circles in the centre panels represent the sign (direction) of the pz orbitals. The pzorbitals change sign across nodal planes, which are shown as blue lines.\nOn further exploration with the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, students discover that the shapes of the allowed one-dimensional wavefunctions are similar (Figure 5), even for different potential models: ie, the lowest-energy wavefunctions all have one \"bump\", with no nodes.\nFigure 5. Lowest-energy approximate wavefunctions for the particle-in-a-box (top panel), simple harmonic oscillator (2nd panel), triangular (3rd panel) and stepped-valley (bottom panel) potentials of Figure 1 andFigure 2. Shaded domains are the forbidden region: V(x) < E.\nthe use of a series of square wells separated by barriers (extended Kronig-Penney model) illustrates that interactions between wells split energy levels. As the number of wells increases, the (single-well) energy splits into a quasi-continuous band of energies, giving rise to the band theory for conductors and semi-conductors.\nAlthough there has been a substantial history in the use of spreadsheet and graphical applications in education (eg 9,10), the author believes that full utilization of the technology, especially in chemical education, has not been realized.\nThe aim of this paper is to teach the qualitative results that arise from applying mathematics to physical and chemical systems, but without the mathematical rigor: \"teaching maths with minimal maths\". The \"new calculus\" advocates the \"rule of four\" (numerical, graphical, symbolic and verbal descriptions) to deepen students' conceptual understanding (2). Students who have a weak background in mathematics do not have the knowledge of calculus required for the usual symbolic algebra approach to physical chemistry. This case study illustrates how a combination of numerical, graphical and verbal descriptions can be used to overcome the lack of symbolic knowledge or ability.\nThe Logical-Mathematical intelligence is only one of multiple \"intelligences\" (11). By changing the emphasis away from mathematical calculus, the numerical-experimental activity, can also cater to those students who favor Spatial or Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligences. A combination of this spreadsheet approach with the traditional calculus-based approach will enable more students (and students of more types of \"intelligences\") to study quantum theory.\nThis paper has focused on the use of spreadsheets but, in principle, the simulations can be done using symbolic mathematical packages such as Mathematica, Maple or MathCAD. This would only be feasible for students who already have a strong mathematical background. This author prefers the use of spreadsheets for weaker students for the following reasons. The symbolic mathematical packages depend on the use of a symbolic, quasi-programming language, which can present an additional learning obstacle for many students (12). Furthermore, the access to symbolic mathematical packages is usually more limited than that of spreadsheets, which are widely available in home, business and community settings. The \"worldware\" (13,14) (also called \"application-software\" (15)) nature of spreadsheets means that students will have greater opportunities to use and become familiar with spreadsheets than with (eg) symbolic mathematical packages, leading to greater utility and expertise: Software that isn't designed for instruction can still be good for learning (13). (A \"straw poll\" of physical chemistry faculty suggests that significantly more faculty use spreadsheets in teaching and learning activities than symbolic mathematical packages (16).\nWhile weaker students will use the spreadsheets, discussed in this paper, as \"black boxes\", more able students can construct similar, appropriate spreadsheets (eg17-19). Instructors will need to be careful in deciding to use the \"black box\" approach or to require students construct their own. If successfully completed, the latter approach will promote deeper learning (19), but the greater complexity of the task (12) may mean that some students cannot complete the task, resulting in frustration and lack of learning.\nThe key feature of using spreadsheets is that students do \"numerical experiments\". (There is an interesting discussion of the use of numerical experiments in (20-22). Numerical experiments (eg 23) were also a key part of the development of chaos theory (20).) By playing with \"what-if\" scenarios, students can test the validity of their concepts and ideas: the success of using spreadsheets in this way is supported by cognitive constructivist models of learning (15,24,25). The use of spreadsheets is intended to give students a qualitative appreciation of quantum theory, and does not serve as a pre-requisite to more advanced studies in quantum theory, for which a reasonable knowledge of mathematics is required.\nThis paper is an expanded version of case studies to be published by LTSN Maths, Stats & OR Network <http://ltsn.mathstore.ac.uk/mathsteam> and by LTSN Physical Sciences <http://www.physsci.ltsn.ac.uk>.\nKFL thanks Ms Jeanne Lee ( ) (Australian Catholic University) for encouraging and helpful discussions, Dr Paul Yates<http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/ch/staff/pcy/pcy.html> (Keele University, UK) for suggestions to improve the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, and Associate Professor (Emeritus) Ian Johnston <http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/johnston.html> (Uniserve\u00b7Science, University of Sydney, Australia) <http://www.usyd.edu.au/su/SCH/> for a seminar on MUPPET (the Maryland University Project in Physics and Educational Technology) <http://www.physics.umd.edu/rgroups/ripe/computer.html> which introduced KFL to the possibilities of numerical experiments in teaching and learning.\nAll URLs checked on 7 March 2003.\nFrancl, M., Survival Guide for Physical Chemistry; Physics Curriculum and Instruction: Lakeville (MN), 2001.\nPreparing for a New Calculus; Solow, A.

The painting carries a $9 million\u201312 million estimate, which would set a new auction record for the artist. Courtesy of Sotheby\u2019s New York.\nRecords could fall at Sotheby\u2019s New York \u201cContemporary Art Evening Auction\u201d on November 17, where the house is predicting a mammoth $9 million\u201312 million hammer price for Woldgate Woods, 24, 25 and 26, 2006, a massive 2006 landscape painting by David Hockney.\nThe acclaimed British artist is having a moment, riding off this summer\u2019s international release of Randall Wright\u2019s documentary Hockney, and looking ahead to the publication of his new book with art critic Martin Gayford, A History of Pictures: From the Cave to the Computer Screen, due out October 18.\nHockney, who will turn 80 next year, will also be the subject of a massive retrospective at Tate Britain, scheduled to run February 9\u2013May 29, 2017. Billed as his most comprehensive exhibition to date, the show will include a number of never-before-seen works.\nDavid Hockney, Beverly Hills Housewife(1966\u201367). Courtesy of Christie\u2019s New York.\nAccording to the artnet Price Database, Hockney\u2019s current record at auction is $7.92 million, set in May 2009 at Christie\u2019s New York with Beverly Hills Housewife. The 1966\u201367 diptych, from the \u201cCalifornia Dreaming\u201d series, is a portrait of the late art philanthropist and photographer Betty Freeman in front of her Los Angeles home.\nThe artist has had five other sales in excess of $5 million, all over the last 10 years.\nThis number appears to be somewhat of a sweet spot for Hockney, as none of those lots topped $5.5 million. The first sale at that price point came in 2006 at Sotheby\u2019s London, for the iconic 1966 swimming pool painting, The Splash.\nDavid Hockney, The Splash (1966). Courtesy of Sotheby\u2019s London.\nA Yorkshire native, Hockney took to the Woldgate Woods in 2006, painting en plein air throughout the seasons, documenting the changes in light and color over the course of the year. He wanted to work on a monumental scale, but the large canvases he had in mind wouldn\u2019t fit up the stairs at his studio, so he combined a number of smaller ones.\nDavid Hockney painting May 17th 2006, Woldgate Woods, East Yorkshire. Courtesy of Sotheby\u2019s, photo \u00a9 Jean-Pierra Goncalves de Lima, artwork \u00a9 David Hockney.\nThree prints of works depicting Woldgate have come to auction in recent years (two fetched under $1,000, the third went unsold), but the upcoming sale marks a first for one of the original canvases.\nDavid Hockney, Woldgate Woods 2006(2006). Courtesy of Venator & Hanstein, Germany.\n\u201cWith the opening of the Tate retrospective early next year, along with collectors\u2019 tremendous appetite for quality, now is the perfect time to present one of the great accomplishments of the artist\u2019s late career,\u201d said Gr\u00e9goire Billault, head of the contemporary art department, in a statement.\nAhead of the sale, Woldgate Woods will be on view at Sotheby\u2019s London October 1\u20137, 2016, and at Sotheby\u2019s New York November 4\u201317. Other potential big ticket items at the auction include a pair of Willem de Kooning canvases\u2014Untitled (1976\u201377) and Untitled XXXIX (1983)\u2014both of which could fetch $8 million\u201312 million.",

    "text": "Psoriasis, a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin disorder. The most common type, called plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), is characterized by slightly elevated reddish patches or papules (solid elevations) covered with silvery white scales. In most cases, the lesions tend to be symmetrically distributed on the elbows and knees, scalp, chest, and buttocks. The lesions may remain small and solitary or coalesce into large plaques that often form geometrical patterns with a central area of normal skin. In many cases the nails become thickened, irregularly laminated, and brittle. In addition to plaque psoriasis, there are four other types of psoriasis, including guttate, pustular, inverse (or flexular), and erythrodermic.\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated (or autoimmune) disorder that occurs when immune cells known as T lymphocytes, or T cells, attack healthy skin cells in both the nonvascular horny outer layer of the skin and its deeper vascular layer. This attack causes the life span of the skin cells to shorten to about 3 to 5 days (skin cells normally live about 20 to 28 days) and forces the cells to reproduce more rapidly than normal. Psoriasis occurs in both sexes with equal frequency, being most prevalent between the ages of 10 and 30. It is most often seen in northern climates. An estimated 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population is affected by psoriasis. In contrast, between 0.05 and 0.3 percent of Asians experience the condition. In European countries the incidence of psoriasis is highly variable, affecting anywhere from less than 1 percent to more than 6 percent of populations.\nThe onset of psoriasis is usually gradual but occasionally explosive. Precipitating factors may include injury to the skin, acute infection, and psychological upsets. Ordinarily, the lesions become less severe and sometimes disappear during the summer, possibly owing to the effect of sunlight. The severe complications of psoriasis are extensive sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, with resulting inflammation, and psoriatic arthritis. Generally, however, individuals with psoriasis are in relatively good health. The variability in the progression and severity of the disorder has led researchers to suspect that the underlying causes of psoriasis are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.\nThere is no permanent cure for psoriasis, but there are a variety of treatments aimed at relieving the associated skin symptoms. Topical treatments for psoriasis come in different forms (e.g., creams and gels) and generally provide relief from inflammation and scaling. Some, such as retinoids (derivatives of vitamin A) and synthetic forms of vitamin D, work by slowing skin cell reproduction, whereas others, such as corticosteroids, coal-tar ointment, and salicylic acid, work by reducing inflammation. Psoriasis can also be treated with phototherapy, in which the skin is exposed to ultraviolet light. While phototherapy can be highly effective, it does have side effects, including pain, irregular pigmentation, and scarring. In addition, long-term treatments are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.\nOral medications are available to treat psoriasis but are often used as a last resort, because the drugs that are most effective in treating psoriasis suppress the immune system, making patients susceptible to a multitude of infections and illnesses that can be life-threatening. Oral drugs that are used to reduce inflammation include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. Oral drugs called biologics (because they are made from human or animal proteins) modulate the immune system by attacking immune cells that are working improperly. Several biologics have been approved for psoriasis, including infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), and guselkumab (Tremfya).",

In my monthly market update I will be pulling numbers for the Menifee\u2019s real estate market. As always my stats are based on single family, detaches residences, with 3+ bedrooms and 2+ baths.\nGetting into the numbers for the month of February, I can see right away that we have gone down in the number of active listings. In January we had a total of 64 and now in February we are down to 48 a 25% decrease in inventory. The Price in which these homes are being listed has risen this month to $325,929 from January\u2019s price of $295,498. With the supply of homes still so low it\u2019s continuing to make it difficult for people to purchase a home in the Menifee area as well as other surrounding communities in the valley.\nNow taking a look at what is selling in Menifee, we haven\u2019t seen as many homes close escrow in January. We have dropped off 17 homes last month in comparison to December\u2019s numbers. The average price in which they are actually selling for has remained within $1000. The amount of time they are remaining on the market is maintaining its average.\nWith the debt relief act continuing until December 31, 2013 many homeowners are taking advantage of the benefits by doing a short sale instead of going through the foreclosure process. I have a lot of experience working with these types of situations and I know they can be a long process but if this is something you or someone you know is considering please call and I will be happy to answer any questions and get the ball rolling. I know this can be a difficult situation, but I am here to help.",

    "text": "A first-summer male RED-FOOTED FALCON has been present north of Stoke-on-Trent (Staffs) since it was first identified on 9th July. It is favouring a horse paddock to the north of the entrance road to the former Chatterley Whitfield Colliery site just off of the roundabout on the A527 Biddulph Road at SJ 882 534 (SatNav ST6 8UW) and has been particularly confiding throughout its stay. Sadly, visiting photographers began artificially feeding the bird from about 12th (for photography reasons) which had the effect of making the bird almost 'hand tame', consequently attracting the wrong sort of 'admirer' and culminating in the attempted kidnap of the bird on 20 July. Despite the two perpetrators being identified and disturbed, they returned for a second attempt on 22nd. As a result of these illegal actions, it is now ESSENTIAL that no photographers attempt to entice the bird with food - no Crickets, no Locusts, NOTHING WHATSOEVER - and all visitors kindly adhere to the on-site instructions. Staffordshire Police were alerted and are now making regular patrols to the site, with Burslem's local police station offering a local Wildlife Liason Officer in attendance intermittently. Staffordshire birdwatchers are also on a rotational wardening system. Due to the nature of the perpetrators however, it is inadvisable for any birdwatcher to confront them but to telephone 0300 123 4455 immediately of a problem or 999 should they capture the bird.\nPeter Hines has very kindly supplied this superb video sequence of the bird - click here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyTWekc8vp8 - showing clearly how capable the bird is at finding natural food on site, of which there is ample.\nWe certainly do not wish to discourage birdwatchers from visiting, the bird being much better protected that you do - it is just that artificial feeding could prove detrimental to the bird's safety and survival. I visited the site on its second day (prior to any feeding) and as you can see from my array of shots below, it performs particularly admirably without any unnecessary encouragement.",

Recognized as a technical master of this medium, Candida H\u00f6fer rhymes the vastness of \u201creal\u201d architectural spaces with those provided by the mechanical apparatus itself to create stark portraits of (mostly uninhabited) spaces generally devoid of any vestige of the personal or anecdotal. H\u00f6fer\u2019s \"Colored Wood\", 2017, is no exception in its technical virtuosity \u2013 the artist having framed the background and foreground in such claustrophobic proximity as to have effectively collapsed the distinction between the two. And yet this is a rare piece in H\u00f6fer\u2019s oeuvre as it captures not a sweeping interior view, but rather an intimate detail thereof. The \u201ccolored wood\u201d that is the work\u2019s putative referent appears vertically across the plane of the print, building a syntax of painterly strokes: light blues, crimsons, a pea green, and finally, 70s-era glossy burnt umber wood. Between these vertical bands, a hazy reticulation unites the visual field. And here, the light seems to emerge from within the flat pictorial space rather than from somewhere outside the frame. At further remove, there is the faint outline of a window, and beside it, perhaps a table or graphic emblem, though it is impossible to say for sure. This is because all of H\u00f6fer\u2019s usual grammar of spatial recession has been inverted in this work, giving us a penetrating exploration of the infinite layers of real and illusory depth that comprise the inscrutable photographic surface.\nC-print, image size: 38 x 39.7 cm, paper size: 56 x 57.7 cm, edition: 100 + 30 A.P., numbered and signed on the back, \u20ac 890.00 plus shipping.",

    "text": "My father in law Charlie was prescribed Clopidogrel on May 2, 2014.\nHe was in turn taken to Pittsburgh hospital in July 30, 2014 with bleeding on the brain, as diagnosed by a neurosurgeon. The doctor placed him in hospice because he could not fix the issue. Charlie died on February 13, 2015. The cause of death listed on his death certificate is subdural hemorrhage.\nThe only lawsuits I have seen relating to this issue are for Plavix, not Clopidogrel which is the generic brand. Are there any lawyers taking Clopidogrel lawsuits? What would I have to do to bring a case for this? Thank you.\nClopidogrel bisulfate, or its generic brand name Plavix, is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The drug was approved in 1997 for prevention of blood clots and to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\nWhile the manufacturer claimed Plavix worked better than aspirin, recent studies have shown that Plavix carries no significant benefit over the much cheaper aspirin.\nThere are currently several class actions in litigation. It appears they are not accepting victims in class actions against Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate.\nGo online and search on class actions for Clopidogrel bisulfate. You will find a good number of law firms representing victims of the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate in class actions and product liability claims. Feel free to contact those firms for further information.\nMy father passed away June 2016. A TIA incident brought us to our nearest hospital. There, the nurse recommended Plavix. Not even three months later he had a massive brain hemorrhage. He died from plavix being in his system before he passed away a week later.\nI read that if he took aspirin with it, which I believe he did for the headache, it increases the chance of bleeding even further. They never went over that, at least not with me in the room.\nThis stuff really shouldn\u2019t be on the market, it does not help anyone no mater how great the thought is. It\u2019s only a great way to kill your family. Hospitals have Total lack of understanding of the use of this drug. Do not take this stuff lightly.\nI don\u2019t know if I can sue them and the hospital since its been two/three years, but if its possible I will. Even if it doesn\u2019t bring back my dad. I want to fight them so at least he wouldn\u2019t have died in vain, for my family and for others.\nI had a heart attack in April 2017 and was put on a generic of Plavix. I was supposed to take it for a whole year but 2 months ago I got a letter in the mail stating the generic for Plavix (the pill I was taking) was on recall. Now I am looking for a lawyer to tell me what I should do because the whole time I was taking this medicine it wasn\u2019t helping me. I\u2019m still having trouble breathing and I have this rash all over my body. I don\u2019t know what to do but I\u2019m about to contact a lawyer.\nI am so sorry about your husband\u2019s death. Thank you very much for giving out this very important information about \u2018the court ruling\u2019. Only after I read your write up I understood why, not a single law firm is willing to go after these drug manufactures, and why they are dropping the cases.\nWith all the death and side effect incidents with this drug, FDA is claiming that \u2018enough\u2019 victims or doctors are not reporting the adverse effect to FDA so they could not recall it! The \u2018number of victims\u2019 report is their base for recall! Did you get a chance to report it to FDA? You could do it online FDA.GOV. Or call 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332) and speak to a person.\nMy husband was bruising all over his body, cardiologists said that is the side effect of clopidogrel and got a bleeding stroke in April of 2016, followed by seizures and complications from that. Fortunately, he is still alive, could not drive, quality of life completely changed, 72 year old need to be taken care of like a seven year old. Now that FDA has the authority over this drug, there is something we could do, thus our loss will not be in vein.\nWe need to write to the FDA administrator, with cc to the white house, the justice department who did the ruling, the house appropriation committee chair who is funding the FDA, the senators and the congressmen/women of our states. There are a lot of victims not able to do anything about it legally, however, collectively we could do a lot about it. If I could save one family from going through the suffering, I will be happy. Please communicate with me if you could.\nMy husband died as a result of taking Plavix following a TIA he had in January of 2012. For 6 months he took Plavix and when it came off patent in May, 2012 he was given the generic called Clopidogrel for 3 more years.\nMany of the side effects of Plavix, or the generic drug, presented in my husband, but were attributed to his existing disease, NASH \u2013 nonalcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.\nDuring the time he was on this medication he had nose bleeds, bleeding in his mouth, and constant bruising. When he had a cerebral hemorrhage and a gastro-intestinal bleed, doctors could not figure out what was happening.\nAfter his death in December of 2015, I proceeded to do some research on my own. Major side effects from these drugs are cerebral hemorrhages, gastro-intestinal bleeds, nose bleeds, gum bleeds, blood bruising and bone marrow disorder.\nIt was this last side effect that ultimately killed my husband. He developed a bone marrow disorder which led to AML leukemia. He died from this leukemia.\nIn my research I have read so many accounts of people who had been prescribed Plavix and were later diagnosed with AML leukemia. Obviously, not a coincidence. It would appear to be a direct result of taking these drugs.\nDue to the ruling by the Supreme Court Justices which stated that all generic drugs and their manufacturers, some 80% of all drugs consumed in the United States, are exempt from liability for side effects, mislabeling, or virtually any other negative reactions caused by their drugs.\nIn short, the Court ruled that the FDA has ultimate authority over pharmaceuticals in the US, and if the FDA says a drug is safe, that takes precedent over actual facts, real victims and any and all adverse reactions.\nIn other words, if the FDA says something is safe, it does not matter if that decision is wrong or the result of misrepresentation, fraud or deception on the part of the world\u2019s pharmaceutical companies.\nThere is no way to sue the FDA for being wrong and costing millions of unsuspecting Americans their lives. That result leaves millions of Americans unprotected from an industry responsible for innumerable preventable deaths in the US from use of these drugs and their side effects.\nMy husband died and there is no recourse. However, if he was holding a hot cup of coffee from McDonald\u2019s, we could have litigated this!\nPharmaceutical companies and our government, in the eyes of the Supreme Court, are putting profits before people. This decision has to be reversed.",

    "text": "The Kearny Mesa Swimming Pool is now much more inviting for disabled visitors.\nCrews striped extra-wide parking spots to accommodate vans for the disabled, and a ramp was added for those who can\u2019t climb the stairs.\nLocker rooms have been gutted to widen restroom, shower and dressing stalls for wheelchair users. The outdoor shower area has been rebuilt to eliminate a step, and easy-to-turn handles will be installed on doors.\nThroughout San Diego, a growing number of public buildings and streets are getting retrofitted as the city steps up spending to tackle a backlog of projects to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSan Diego used to spend about $1.5 million a year on such projects. Now it\u2019s spending $10 million more per year on curb cuts, ramps, audible signals and detectable warning tiles at street intersections, among other improvements to remove barriers to access.\nMayor Jerry Sanders has committed to spending the additional $50 million over five years to improve access, in part by allocating proceeds from the sales of surplus city properties.\n\u201cBefore the mayor came into the office, we were just doing a trickle of projects. We are doing a lot of projects now,\u201d said David Jarrell, deputy chief operating officer for public works.\nAdvocates for the disabled said the improvements would help cut down the city\u2019s liability. Cities across the country have been sued for failure to improve access. San Diego was sued in 1997 by disabled residents who claimed they had been denied equal access to Qualcomm Stadium. The lawsuit was settled after the city agreed to spend $5.25 million to equip the stadium with new elevators, ramps, parking spaces and seating.\nBill Harris, a Sanders\u2019 spokesman, said the desire to do the right thing \u2013 not legal exposure \u2013 drove the mayor\u2019s commitment to ADA compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about avoiding litigation. It\u2019s about ensuring equal access,\u201d Harris said.\nAccording to the city, more than 500 curb ramps were installed in the past two years. About $19 million of projects are in design stages and an additional $4 million in jobs are under construction.\nFacilities being retrofitted range from police stations and recreation centers to branch libraries and teen centers.\nCindi Jones, director of the Center for an Accessible Society in San Diego, said improvements have been made, but the city still has a long way to go. She uses a scooter and her husband uses a wheelchair.\nIn South Park, where she and her husband have lived for 30 years, a curb cut was installed on their block about a year ago, Jones noted. She\u2019s looking forward to more curb cuts in her neighborhood.\nThe city\u2019s former disability services coordinator, Linda Woodbury, had said the city needed to spend $500 million on ADA compliance, but the mayor\u2019s office has disputed that figure. Woodbury was fired in 2006, a day after Sanders first proposed spending $50 million more on access projects. The city later settled a wrongful termination suit.\nLouis Frick, executive director of Access to Independence in San Diego, said the access features benefit society as a whole.\n\u201cYou see people all the time with baby strollers, delivery truck drivers, where they are using the curb cuts to get up and down the sidewalks,\u201d he said.",

They conclude that computerized decision support systems should be implemented in ambulatory care.\nTreatments delivered in the home carry the potential for certain risks. This commentary examines the literature on dialysis-related incidents occurring in the home setting and presents a framework to help address avoidable adverse events in home hemodialysis.\nPatients with chronic kidney failure are at high risk for adverse events from treatment errors. This publication raises awareness of safety in end-stage renal disease care, explores factors specific to this setting that contribute to failure, and describes techniques for clinicians to reduce risk of errors.\nKliger AS.

Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf. 2013;39:70-76.\nIn this study, communication between inpatient and outpatient dialysis units at discharge was highly variable.\nAn elderly man presented to an emergency department (ED) with new onset chest pain. In reviewing the patient's electronic medical record (EMR), the ED physician noted a history of \"PE,\" but the patient denied ever having a pulmonary embolus. Further investigation in the EMR revealed that, many years earlier, the abbreviation was intended to stand for \"physical examination.\" Someone had mistakenly copied and pasted PE under past medical history, and the error was carried forward for years.\nA woman with end-stage renal disease, who often skipped dialysis sessions, was admitted to the hospital with fever and given intravenous opiates for pain. Because her permanent arteriovenous graft was clotted, she had been receiving dialysis via a temporary femoral catheter, increasing her risk for infection. Blood cultures grew yeast; the patient was diagnosed with fungal endocarditis, likely caused by injections of opiates through her catheter.",

    "text": "ESG integration is gaining more traction in private equity. Robeco\u2019s latest Private Equity Engagement Report concludes that fund managers in the company\u2019s private equity ESG Program have taken further steps to embrace ESG factors and integrate them into their investment processes.\n\u201cIf we look at the activities of PE fund managers in the last year, we can conclude that ESG factors have become further integrated into their investment process.\u201d, states the report in its introduction. Recommendations by the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, the adoption of the European Commission\u2019s Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth and the publication of a guidance document on ESG Monitoring, Reporting and Dialogue in Private Equity by PRI suggest that this positive trend will continue.\nIn the twelfth edition of the ESG Engagement Report1 Robeco Private Equity documents the activities of PE managers that are part of its ESG Engagement Program.\n2017 was a year in which General partners (GPs) continued to strengthen their ESG integration in investment, monitoring and reporting practices which has translated into stable overall ESG scores.\nThe average ESG score for the 63 fund managers that participated in last year\u2019s survey was 69%, compared to 66% in 2016 and 59% in 2015. Meanwhile, the median ESG score stands at 69%, versus 69% in 2016 and 64% in 2015. These figures indicate that most fund managers now have functioning ESG frameworks in place.\nThe results are based on an annual assessment by Robeco Private Equity that uses a reporting and assessment tool developed by the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). A growing number of investors in the private equity world are now signing up to the PRI and its goals.\nThe reputational risk of private equity portfolio companies monitored by Robeco Private Equity remains relatively low. The analysis of ESG-related news stories and alerts by RepRisk2 shows that the majority were not involved in any ESG-related incidents. Those that received negative media attention experienced relatively low impact and coverage. To increase awareness of ESG issues and encourage better communication, Robeco Private Equity continuously engages with fund managers whose portfolio companies have had to deal with incidents.\nIn their role of active owner of portfolio companies and the extended control this entails (compared to public companies), the PE managers are in a good position to promote the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs3).\nIn 2017 the number of PE fund managers that committed to contributing to these SDGs increased further. In terms of the contribution to specific goals, most portfolio companies contributed to SDG 7 and SDG 12, which relate to sustainable energy and sustainable consumption and production.\nDespite the increasing focus on SDGs, the report also recognizes that SDG-related and impact reporting is still in its infancy and most of the managers first need to develop consistent ESG reporting frameworks.\nAn analysis of how PE managers currently manage climate-related risks and opportunities also indicated that half of the respondents have already incorporated climate-related risks and opportunities into their investment strategy and process in some way. In addition, 38% of the fund managers have integrated their process for climate-related risks into their overall risk management.\nHowever, only 24% of managers currently engage with their portfolio companies to encourage better disclosure and practices relating to climate-related risks. The survey results also showed that only about one-fifth of managers currently use emission data or analysis in investment decision-making. These percentages show clear potential for improvement.\nRobeco Private Equity\u2019s ESG Engagement program, introduced in 2014, aims to encourage private equity fund managers to implement ESG best practices in their investment process. Through its ESG activities, which have been recognized by the PRI with an A+ rating, Robeco Private Equity aims to draw the attention of PE managers to ESG issues and assist them in their efforts.\nAs part of the program, private equity fund managers undergo an annual ESG assessment which serves as input for dialogue on potential improvements. Robeco Private Equity\u2019s ESG engagement program strives to contribute to improving the risk-reward characteristics of client portfolios and enhance the added value of private equity fund managers.\n1 Please note that we have changed the year referencing in the title of our annual ESG engagement report. The data that fund managers reported to us relate to the end of calendar year 2017, but the report was written and published in 2018. Henceforth the year of publication will therefore be recorded in the title of our annual ESG reports.\n2 RepRisk, a leading business intelligence provider specialized in environmental, social and governance risk analytics to monitor the reputational risk of portfolio investments.\n3 SDGs represent the global sustainability agenda for 2030 and provide a systematic framework for dealing with the most pressing social and environmental challenges globally.",

    "text": "I have been busy baking Christmas cookies for the last couple of days. This is one of the first ones I did. It is a butter sugar cookie that you can flavor anyway you like and color anyway you like. I had intended to make these redder than they are but after about 10 drops of food coloring in them I decided that was enough. When I make these again I will use paste food coloring to get a deeper more intense color like a Christmas red. I like pink and green together so it worked for me. Store these in an airtight container and they should last for days.\nConfused as to what type of butter, shortening or margarine to use and does it make a difference? You bet it does. Vegetable shortening, margarine and butter in some recipes are interchangeable. Ask most experienced bakers, though, and they will tell you that one of their secret weapons is plain, pure butter. Butter serves several purposes in cookie baking, it tenderizes and conveys the flavor of the cookie.\nCompare the difference between a shortbread cookie and that of biscotti. Shortbread cookies seem to almost melt in your mouth, where as biscotti has a much lower butter content and are hard and crunchy. If a cookie recipe calls for butter, I\u2019d use the butter, especially in cookies where butter is the flavor of the cookie. On the other hand cookies such as Molasses or gingerbread, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use shortening. Do not use \u201creduced fat\u201d or whipped butter products when you bake cookies, they can contain up to 58% water.\nYou want the cookies to spread more: Use all butter or add 1 to 2 tablespoons liquid (water, milk or cream) or use a low-protein flour such as bleached all-purpose (but not one that is chlorinated) or add 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar.\nYou want the cookies to spread less: Cut the sugar by a few tablespoons or add 1/4-1/2 cup additional flour.\nYou want the cookies to have a chewy quality: Melt the butter instead of simply using it at room temperature.\nBrightly colored Christmas Pinwheel Cookies are perfect on the holiday cookie tray.\nIn your mixer bowl combine butter and powdered sugar. When combined add the egg and flavoring.\nAdd the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix well. Divide dough in half.\nAdd food coloring of choice to each half. Fold the dough over and over until it is mixed in.\nTake a tablespoon of each dough and put together to form a ball. Roll the dough into a long snake about 6 inches long. Starting at one end roll the dough into a cylinder. Dip the edges into the sprinkles and place on a greased baking sheet.\nBake for about 8 minutes. Do not overbake. Let set on cookie sheet for about 5 minutes when the cookies come out of the oven. Remove to a wire rack to cool.\nWould you like to try another recipe?",

    "text": "Tulsa race riot survivor: \"Learn how to forgive, but never forget\"\nSAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A 100-inch, high definition screen projects an intense college basketball game. Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter.\nSean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California.\nThis is not your typical barbershop.\nAnd that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood.\n\"We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,\" says Heywood.\nMR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops.\n\"We're trying to thrive, not just survive,\" Heywood said.\nMR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network.\nThe two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track.\nAmong other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly.\n\"We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,\" Walker says.\nGiving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago.\n\"All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,\" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago.\nImagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area.\nThat was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921.\nBut on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.\nSound off: What challenges do black entrepreneurs face?\niReport.com: How would you make black America better?\n\"People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' \" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. \"We evacuated. They were destroying everything.\"\nThe death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials.\nThe riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered.\n\"It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,\" says Walker.\nWess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, \"We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box.\"\nHis advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it.\n\"Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,\" Young says.\nWalker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him.\n\"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,\" he says. \"I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.\"",

Thanks for all you do. We love you!\nA very Merry Christmas from our house to yours.\nThe Maslyn Mrs. is not know for her love of cooking or cleaning, but one recipe she thinks every cook should know is this brunch family favorite. She though you might like to have it for Christmas morning! It is not low-fat, but hey, it\u2019s a holiday.\nCut up bread in cubes & spread in 1/2 in greased casserole dish.\nMix the rest of the ingredients together & pour over bread.\nUse a flat spatula to press down bread so it is fully saturated.\nCover with plastic wrap & let it sit in the fridge over night.\nCook all ingredients except the butter for 2 minutes in a small saucepan on the stove until it is bubbly.\nRemove from stove & stir in butter.\nPour over baked strata right before you serve it.\nWe wish for you a working oven all holiday season long, but if you do happen to need an oven repair, call Maslyn & Sons Appliance and we will be there to help so you can make this tasty recipe for your family. (And remember not to clean your oven right before a big holiday as that is the #1 time ovens tend to go out.\nTo keep the oven, garbage disposal and kitchen sink drain in good working condition this holiday season, take some precautions. Oven problems usually go unnoticed until the big meal is already inside the oven, so a few minutes spent checking your kitchen appliances could save your holiday season.\nAlso, as we mentioned at Thanksgiving, avoid running the self-cleaning cycle RIGHT before a big holiday dinner (because this might cause something to go wrong with your oven\u2026 do it WELL in advance so if something breaks, you have plenty of time to call Maslyn & Sons Appliance out).\nReplace gaskets at the first sign of a leak or if moisture appears on outside of oven.\nAvoid pouring grease down your drain into your garbage disposal.\nThrow leftovers in the trash or compost pile instead of putting down the garbage disposal.\nEnsure there is enough space around appliances to allow heat to escape.\nSo pleased to welcome a new \u201cdaughter-in-love\u201d to our family!\n*Replace charcoal filter on your VENT HOOD (1x every 12 months).\n*Swap out rubber drain hoses for braided stainless steel on your WASHER to prevent floods and leaks.\nMaslyn & Sons Appliance repair does appliance maintenance as well as appliance repair!\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, mix together mustard, syrup, and vinegar. Place chicken breasts into 9\u00d713 baking dish. Season with salt and pepper.\nPour mustard mixture over chicken. No need to marinate.\nBake for about 30-40 minutes or until meat thermometer reads 165 degrees. Season with rosemary. Prepare for people to ask you to make it again.\n\u201cThanksgiving. It\u2019s like we didn\u2019t even TRY to come up with a tradition. The tradition is, we overeat.\nGet your microwave squeaky clean before you have guests for the holiday. It will work better AND be less embarrassing!\nFill a microwave-safe glass or bowl half full of water. Add a tablespoon of white vinegar.\nTurn on for 5 minutes. You may need less time in a high-powered microwave oven; keep an eye on it the first time you try this. This will steam up the walls of the microwave and loosen the dried-on gunk.\nRemove the glass container (with hot pads). Wipe down the inside of the microwave with a clean rag or paper towel while it is still steamy and the gunk is still softened.\nThe loose gunk should come off easily now.\nTake out the glass tray or turntable and wash it like a dish. You could even run it through the dishwasher if you have time.\nWe hope your appliances stay in tip-top working order as you enter this busy holiday season, but if they don\u2019t, call Maslyn and Sons Appliance and we will come out and do your microwave repair in a jiffy!",

    "text": "Two recently published reports shed damning light on the high cost of low wages in the fast food industry \u2013 an industry dominated by the restaurant giant McDonald\u2019s, which raked-in over $5.4 billion in profits last year.\nThe reports \u2013 Super Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry \u2013 argue that low-wages in the fast-food industry cost taxpayers nearly $7 billion annually.\nMedicaid and CHIP (the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) account for more than half of the $7 billion, at an average of $3.9 billion annually. Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers\u2019 families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.\u201d Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald\u2019s cost tax-payers \u201c$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,\u201d according to the report.\nYUM! Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC), Subway, Burger King and Wendy\u2019s round-out the top five fast-food companies with workers who rely on public assistance.\nThe median average wage for fast-food workers is $8.69; an estimated 87 percent of fast-food workers do not receive health benefits. Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n\u201cThis business model puts tax-payers on the hook, while rewarding corporate CEO\u2019s,\u201d Jack Temple, a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project and co-author of Super Sizing Public Costs, said during a conference call with the press on October 15.\nThe reports come on the heels of a nation-wide wave of fast-food worker strikes; most recently strikes took place in over 60 cities across the nation with thousands of fast-food workers walking off their jobs.\n\u201cThe CEO of McDonald\u2019s makes more in a day than I make in a year,\u201d Yates added.\nFast-food workers nationally are calling for $15 an-hour in pay and the right to form or join a union without retaliation.\nJacobs also addressed the wave of non-traditional worker organizing taking place in fast-food, retail and other low-wage service sector jobs.\nSuper Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill was published by the National Employment Law Project and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry was published by the University of California Labor Center.",

    "text": "When Cait and I found out how easy it is to make ravioli\u2013and with such completely impressive and delicious results!\u2013we just had to share this fabulous harvest recipe with you.\nThis dish is a poem to autumn, filled with sweet, tender butternut squash combined with a touch of honey, fresh thyme, rosemary, sage, and Parmesan, and topped with chopped hazelnuts (or you could substitute walnuts) and brown butter. This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997).",

    "text": "I have it for more than half a year..simply can't live without it. Can't even imagine flying without it now. Drivers are getting better, does more fluent job. Now it remembers staying in absolute mode and I can safely shutdown Windows (XP SP1) without getting the trackir drivers stuck. Simply amazing!!!\nI've used it for 3 years now in sims. Still works as new.\nSoftware has been constantly improved and it gets better and better all the time.\nThe longer you have it the more you like it, I hated it at first but now I wont fly without it.\nYou just have to learn to use it,for example always sit the same distance from the Tir unit or the responce will vary greatly.And use lots of deadzone at first then slowly reduce it as your skills improve.\nBrought the 3D into flightsimming, that's for sure. Now I can look at my instruments, out the window, through my body by turning my head.\nIt's not like in real life, but it gets closer..\nI still use it from time to time.\nI find it of less value/use on non-full real.\nWhen I have the 'pit off or external views I find it disorienting, but that may be down to practice!\nAnd as I am having a major problem adjusting to the new FM's I don't have the time or patience to put into TIR in these circumstances!\nAnd the orientation is automatic because you always have feedback where you look, because you move your head in that direction. But if you're not used to it, it may take a bit of practice. It's not hard though.\nSo when i fly pit off, i only fly with just the gunsight as visual reference and never lose orientation. TrackIR is handy with all settings, medium easy or hard. It's just like using a joystick to fly when for years you've been using the arrow keys to fly. TrackIR is also the HOTAS (= hands OFF throttle and stick) to look around.\nSometimes i watch trk's in external view and recreate external padlock with the trackIR. Focusing on 1 plane while tracking the other(s) with it. You can do that all without pressing buttons. It's great. So people who think trackIR is only usefull in full real games haven't yet discovered the full capability of trackIR yet./i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif Because it's even better in medium or easy games.\nIt's getting better and better! No flying without it as far as I'm concerned.\nNew software (2.11) supports it in FS2004 as well. Go get it!\nI better stop being lazy and negotiate with my wife for some extra 'stick time'!\nYou can also look at the map while looking around the countryside to orient yourself looking for landmarks, rivers towns etc. And if you want, you can steer the view independantly of the gun if you want to play reargunner. In short, it was already good back then, it's great now, and it's getting better all the time.\nNew software/drivers is good too!\nCan't wait to fire it up again when I get home tonight!\n\"Sorry kids, Daddy is busy\"\nWhat is the price for TrackIr?\nIs it available in skandinavia?\nDNMY made a comment about the map and he(she?) was dead on. It's nice to be able to look around when the map is open. I can finally give up on the map navigation lines being on, padlock on, etc and now can fly effectively with 100% realism options on. I paid $119 usd with $19 shipping. I was especially glad to know you can use reflective tape and not have to depend on the manufacturer for those dots.\n- What is the price for TrackIr?\n- Is it available in skandinavia?\nThey have a European sales office, they sell TrackIR as well as 3D Glasses.",

In this study, we extended our inquiry to determine whether the incidence of long-term injury leave varies across shifts.\nPolice officers (N=419) from an urban department were included in the analysis. Daily payroll work history data from 1994\u20132010 was collected. Injury leave duration was examined ranging from \u22651\u2013\u226590 days. Poisson regression models were used to compute incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) of long-term injury.\nCumulative incidence of injury for different durations of leave defined as \u22651, \u22655, \u226510, \u226515, \u226530, and \u226590 days were 61.3%, 45.4%, 39.9%, 33.9%, 26.5%, and 9.6% respectively. Age-and gender adjusted IRR of long-term injury (\u226590 days) for night versus day shifts was IRR 3.12, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.35\u20137.21 and IRR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04\u20134.68, for night versus afternoon shifts. Among all durations examined, the largest IRR was for injury \u226590 days, night versus day shifts (IRR 3.12, 95% CI 1.35\u20137.21).\nNight shift work was significantly associated with long-term injury among police officers after adjustment for age and gender. Although type of injury was not available, it is possible that variation in injury type across shifts might account for some of this association.\nJ Occup Environ Med. 59(11):1084-1088.\nJ Occup Environ Med. 58(3):e66-e71.",

    "text": "Phew! Do you feel like an emotional husk after yesterday's big wave carnage and confounded trying to keep up with a blast of events happening at the same time? Spike summarises for us.\nWhat a crazy day of surfing, and its been and will be happening today, again, at the business end of the surfing and SUP season. Stephanie Gilmore just won the women's WSL Championship Tour after surfing in one heat but the clincher for her was when main challenger Lakey Peterson was eliminated from the Beachwaver Maui Pro in cranking 8 foot surf.\nThen, Keana Kennelly won the women's BWT last night by trying to commit hara kiri on waves already bordering on tow only. The same went for the men afterwards. Even they were in way over their heads, so to speak. Did you know they called off the men's event not because they thought it too dangerous (at first) but because they literally 'lost' Russel Bierke at Jaws last night? For me, the red light was already flashing like a strobe light watching the women's suicidal commitment.\nGut wrenching stuff! Then we had to watch the same trait to end life as we know it by the men. Was that barrel that Twiggy planed into - a hair's breath away from another flotation vest-ripping, bone-snapping over the falls death dance - the biggest barrel paddled into in the history of .... like everything?\nIt was insane. Well, we have more of the same tonight. Tighten your britches bru, stomach in, chest out! Try stock up on adrenaline after it was sucked dry last night.\nToday is a busy day in the water world of waves and SUP. The Vans World Cup is on at Sunset beach and Jordy Smith joins six other Saffas in the lineup (and seven if you count Benji Brand), with Jordy winning his Round 1 heat and leapfrogging Round 2 direct to Round 3. Dylan Lightfoot, Mikey February, Adin Masencamp, Matthew McGillivray, Beyrick De Vries, and David van Zyl are all through to four-man Round 2 heats with the top two joining the top two who went direct to Round 3. Oh, and Sunset is fire ing.\nThe ISA World SUP and Paddleboard Champs just wound down the day in China, with the SUP Surfing done after Riyue Bay was fed by waves from a typhoon. Sadly, despite a good show, Thomas King dropped out in Repecharge Heat 7, two heats from the final. But he's into the Men's technical race repercharge, as is Kimon dos Santos, which is one heat from the final. Tarryn King has made the women's final main event of Technical Racing, with Tamsyn Foster into the repecharge.\nThen there's the Taiwan Open World Longboarding Champs running in a parallel time zone in Taiwan. Four Saffas are there. Steezy Sawyer (24) of Jeffreys Bay, Sam Christianson (20) Alfonzo Pieters (29) and Chrystal Hulett (22). Matthew Moir had a wildcard entry, but apparently has too much work going on, and couldn't attend.\nEven without Mouse, this is the most experienced group to attend a WSL Longboard Championships. Steezy Sawyer, despite breaking his board and taking a sip of piss in a bizarre bit of miscommunication, is through to Round 3 and is a big favourite. Muizenberg local Pieters was knocked out in Round 2, but Christianson prevailed in the last heat of the day a short while ago (11am SA time). Hulett is up early tomorrow.\nJinsun Harbour has had lank swell, and the longboarders are ripping. In a first for the WSL, world champions from two separate disciplines will be crowned at the same venue when the WSL Junior Surfing Championships follow the longboarding from 1-9 December.\n\"Round 2\" of the big wave surfing at Jaws (and conditions look just as hairy, though hopefully a little more benign) will be called at around 7pm this evening SA time.\nYou'll be spoiled for choice, with the Vans Triple Crown event at Sunset also set to kickstart this evening around the same time, or a bit later. PLUS we have the women's Beachwaver Maui Pro continuing too, and the surf as you know is GOING OFF in Hawaii.\nBy the way, amidst the women's CT world title excitement, spare a thought for Ventura native Sage Erickson, who was on the opposite end of the spectrum shored up by Gilmore's elation. Like Lakey, she was eliminated in Round 2 by Nikki Van Dijk, which means she fails to requalify for 2019. She also narrowly misses requalifying via the QS by one heat at the Port Stephens Toyota Pro earlier this month.\nAnyway, get the AV going, and get ready to bounce around to different events like a crazy person.",

The British pop rock band, The Outfeild had eight Billboard 100 hits from 1986 \u2013 1992 which includes of course it\u2019s Number 6 big hit, Your Love which was written by John. Their debut album, Play Deep spent 66 weeks on the chart and went Platinum.\nOddly, The Outfield had great commercial success in the US much more than their homeland. I think I still have my Outfield cassettes. I wore them out and loved them. Their songs still bring me back to my youth as soon as I play them. I thank them for the great music which became the soundtrack of my youth.\nWe would like to thank you for \u2018Your Love\u2019 and the continued support you have given John throughout his career. He loved making music and playing his guitar. He found pleasure knowing that his music made people happy and bought them fond memories. He worked hard with many days in pain to finish the Replay album. There were times when he could barely pick up his guitar, but he refused to give up knowing he would disappoint fans. The hardest day for John was when he put his guitar in its case announcing his hands could no longer play.\nDuring the last months of his life, John, Tony and Alan wrote new material. What the future holds for this is unclear at the time of this writing.\nI will leave you with one of my favorite songs from The Outfield, Your Love.\nAdelita\u2019s Way gearing up for their album release with another instant download for pre-orders!",

If your post is not directly related to this discussion please consider making a new thread.\nEvery researcher or diagnostician working with reptiles has faced the challenge of identifying reptile hemoparasites and then determining whether they are of importance or merely incidental. Another challenge is how to easily find the information required to make the proper identification. A distillation of knowledge from world-renowned expert Sam R. Telford, Jr, Hemoparasites of the Reptilia: Color Atlas and Text provides a comprehensive compilation of information on how to differentiate between the myriad species of reptile hemoparasites.\nThe atlas provides diagnoses for 262 species of plasmodiids, hemogregarines, hemococcidians, trypansosomes, and leishmanias, including descriptions of eight new species or new taxonomic designations. It also discusses lesser known groups, such as piroplasms, rickettsiae, chlamydia, and erythrocytic viruses. Each genus and many species are represented among the 166 taxa illustrated in color. The species accounts contain host and geographic distribution, with precise localities when possible, prevalence, life cycles and vectors when known, effects upon the host, and ecology of the host-parasite relationship, morphological variation, and an exhaustive bibliography. The book also includes an illustrated key showing diagnostic characters.\nTelford draws on his 45 years of experience and his personal collection, considered the world\u2019s most complete, to provide information on the morphology of the unicellular parasites of reptilian blood. He includes information from hard-to-find original papers and articles from sources throughout the world. The illustrated key and photomicrographs from Telford\u2019s collection make identifying species quicker and easier.\nLast edited by Motoko; 6th September 2012 at 07:09 PM.

    "text": "This is a model of an RhB (Rhaetian Railroad) class ABe 8/12 \"Allegra\" powered rail car train. The paint and lettering are prototypical for Era VI. The model has traction tires and is driven on four wheelsets by two ball bearing B\u00fchler motors. It has an mfx/DCC sound decoder with many sound and light functions. The pantographs can be raised and lowered digitally on both end cars. All the cars on the train have metal wheels, and the center car has wheelsets with ball bearings. All the doors can be opened. The model has many separately applied details such as conductors, plugs, windshield wipers, antennas, and rear-view mirrors. The model has sprung buffers and complete rail clearance devices (the center part of the rail clearance devices can be replaced with a standard LGB coupler that is included with the train). Length over the buffers 206 cm / 81-1/8\".\nLGB 22225 \u2013 RhB Class ABe 8/12 \"Allegra\" Powered Rail Car Train On October 14, 2009, the Rhaetian Railroad (RhB) set a new milestone in its tradition-filled history, because the first of 15 new three-part dual system powered rail car trains (11 kilovolts /16.7 Hertz and 1 kilovolt DC), the class \"ALLEGRA\", was festively received on this day in Landquart. The new train is not only highly modern, but it also conceals significant innovations and a lot of power inside. All the wheelsets are powered in both end cars. The multi-system drive equipment consists of 4 drive trains with water-cooled IGBT rectifiers and produces 2.6 megawatts / 3,485 horsepower with AC voltage (2.4 megawatts / 3,217 horsepower with 1 kilovolt DC). That is extremely high because the most powerful RhB locomotive, the high-performance class Ge 4/4 III, offers \"only\" 3.1 megawatts / 4,155 horsepower of performance. With 8 powered wheelsets and its performance, the \"ALLEGRA\" develops a correspondingly high tractive effort of 260 kilo newton / 58,450 pound-force, which exceeds that of the Ge 4/4 III by 30%. With it, the builder Stadler succeeded in creating a unique meter gauge powered rail car train in the entire world in terms of power density, performance, and weight. One special challenge here was to \"stow\" the power packets in the limited space beneath the powered rail car floor and on the roof, which also succeeded thanks to innovative solutions. The non-powered intermediate car offers comfortable entry with its depressed floor area, a handicap-accessible toilet, and storage space for baby strollers. There is space in the class ABe 8/12 with its fully air conditioned passenger areas for 24 seats in 1st class and 76 seats in 2nd class as well as additional fold-down seats and standing room. A modern passenger information system with flat screens is also standard. The ends of the powered rail car trains with the Grisons canton coat-of-arms lends the lower part of the cab with its shape coming to a point and the straight cab windows arching to the back a certain sharp edged look and it also symbolizes its power. The \"ALLEGRA\" can also claim a speed record for meter gauge trains because on December 20, 2010 unit 3502 reached a proud 145 km/h / 91 mph on a special run in the Vereina Tunnel.",

    "text": "According to one narrative, the Timberwolves decided after Friday\u2019s loss to the Kings to trade Jimmy Butler.\nBut he might have forced their hand, resulting in his trade to the 76ers.\nButler decided he would play on Friday night, but he viewed it as the fork in the road. If the Timberwolves didn\u2019t find a deal to fulfill his long-simmering trade request after that, he would begin to sit indefinitely, league sources told The Athletic.\nThe Kings defeated Minnesota 121-110 to push the Timberwolves to 4-9 and a winless road trip; Butler had 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in 41 minutes. He had played almost 124 minutes in the last three games, all losses, and at halftime of the final one, the Wolves were informed that this was it for Butler, sources said.\nButler reportedly held out for a game a couple weeks ago, though he and Minnesota both denied it. It\u2019s quite believable he would\u2019ve held out again if not traded. Still, informing the team during a game he\u2019s playing would have been quite bold.\nI\u2019m not sure who actually blinked first. This could be an I-quit, no-you\u2019re-fired (or vice versa) scenario. Both Butler and Timberwolves president-coach Tom Thibodeau are stubborn.\nBut the most important thing is Butler is gone and both sides can move on \u2013 whatever ugliness preceded the trade.",

    "text": "There were 13,328,066 shares of the Registrant\u2019s Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on July 31, 2016.\nThe consolidated balance sheet of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) at September 30, 2015 was derived from the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were made. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nCertain amounts previously presented in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-17-Income Taxes (Topic 740) requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The purpose of this adoption was to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of this standard. The effect of the adjustment at September 30, 2015 was a $6.4 million decrease in current assets, a $10,000 decrease in current liabilities, a $3.0 million increase in non-current deferred tax assets and a $3.4 million decrease in non-current deferred tax liabilities. Such reclassification had no effect on our previously reported net loss, stockholders\u2019 equity or cash flows.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. At June 30, 2016, management reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets based on future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying value of certain rental assets exceeded the expected future cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016. No such impairment of remaining long-lived assets was necessary as the expected future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the assets.\nThe Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale of its manufactured rental equipment. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases of its manufactured products. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by the customer. Except for certain of the Company\u2019s reservoir characterization products, the Company\u2019s products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and the Company\u2019s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit. The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company\u2019s equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer. Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nimmediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities will apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, this new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The guidance also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance was issued to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a five-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this guidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either retrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance and affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nAt June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company\u2019s Canadian subsidiary had $27.5 million and $28.1 million, respectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries. In order to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. Approximately $3.3 million of these Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable are considered by management to be of a short-term nature whereby the appreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will result in a gain or loss, respectively, to the consolidated statement of operations. The Company considers the remaining $24.2 million Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable to be of a long-term nature and whereby settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future; therefore, any resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are reported in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 830 \u201cForeign Currency Matters\u201d. In June 2016, the Company entered into a $3.0 million 90-day hedge contract with a United States bank to hedge a portion of its short-term Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure. This contract reduces the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. At June 30, 2016, the fair value of this contract was a liability of $11,000.\nequivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective balance sheet dates.\nThe Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis in evaluating potential impairment losses related to long-lived assets.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company made non-cash inventory transfers of $3.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, to its rental equipment fleet. Raw materials include semi-finished goods and component parts totaling $52.5 million and $48.4 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.\nOn March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank with borrowing availability of $50.0 million (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). On May 4, 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which reduced its borrowing availability to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base. Under the amendments to the Credit Agreement, the borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company\u2019s and its U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (excluding work-in-process inventories). As of June 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s borrowing base was $35.3 million resulting in borrowing availability of $30.0 million less $0.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. The Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets. The Credit Agreement expires on May 4, 2018 and all borrowed funds are due and payable at that time. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Credit Agreement as amended limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares certain of the Company\u2019s assets to certain of its liabilities, restricts the Company and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement as amended is based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which was 3.50% at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 182,400 shares of restricted stock under its 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The weighted average grant date fair value of the restricted stock was $14.84 per share. The grant date fair value of these awards was $2.7 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards was determined based on the closing market price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are entitled to dividends, if paid.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company also issued 69,300 nonqualified stock options under the Plan. The options issued are based upon three tiers, each with separate market and service based vesting conditions. Market based vesting conditions are based on achieving a specified market return on the Company\u2019s stock price. Compensation expense for the nonqualified stock option awards was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which incorporates the possibility that the market conditions may not be satisfied. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options issued was determined to be $5.96 per option resulting in unrecognized compensation costs of $0.4 million, which will be charged to expense over the requisite service period of the options, ranging from 18 to 36 months.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $8.1 million relating to restricted stock awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. In addition, the Company had $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonqualified stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\nAs of June 30, 2016, a total of 276,150 shares of restricted stock and 159,000 nonqualified stock options shares were outstanding.\nFor the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, 159,000 stock options and 89,700 stock options, respectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as a result of their impact being antidilutive.\nThe Company is involved in various pending or potential legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation. Management is not aware of any material pending or known to be contemplated legal or government proceedings against the Company.\nThe Company reports and evaluates financial information for two segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic. Seismic product lines include: land and marine wireless data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products. The Non-Seismic product lines include: thermal imaging products and industrial products.",

    "text": "Amish Broccoli Cauliflower Salad tossed in a creamy dressing of yogurt and mayonnaise. This easy recipe is perfect for gatherings and low carb friends.\nThe first time I had a raw broccoli salad was at my bridal shower over 20 years ago. My mother\u2019s recipe for broccoli salad had bacon and cranberries. Yum. It\u2019s been my family\u2019s go-to summer salad ever since. But it\u2019s nice to change things up once in awhile. This Amish broccoli cauliflower salad does it for me. It\u2019s especially a hit with the cheese lovers in the family!\nI have a recipe for low carb broccoli salad with bacon on the blog. I love it because it\u2019s so easy to customize. I add nuts and seeds by whim and sometimes add a few raisins or unsweetened cranberries. A little sesame oil adds a pleasant sweet flavor.\nWhat I really like about this Amish broccoli cauliflower salad recipe is the cheese. Using sharp cheddar cheese adds a nice tang and texture to the salad.\nSome recipes for Amish cauliflower salad call for grated cheddar cheese, but I like it cubed. I admit it\u2019s purely based on aesthetics. The grated cheese mixes well, but the salad becomes a creamy indiscernible mess. Cubing the cheese adds another visible layer of texture.\nThis recipe, too, is easy to customize. Try replacing the cheddar cheese with Parmesan or any other favorite. Add seeds or nuts \u2013 sunflower seeds would be great. Try using a colored variety of cauliflower for fun.\nAnd who doesn\u2019t like a cool creamy dressing? Many recipes for Amish broccoli salad call for a combination of mayonnaise and sour cream. I opted to use mayonnaise and Greek yogurt. Use either \u2013 they\u2019re both great.\nThe salad keeps well in the fridge and is a great for family gatherings or a pot-luck. I make sure to bring low carb sides or sugar-free desserts to any gatherings so that I have a few on-plan options.\nAmish Broccoli Cauliflower Salad is 3 net carbs per cup.\nMeanwhile, wash and chop the vegetables and place into a large bowl. If serving the salad the next day, cover and refrigerate.\nMix the ingredients for the dressing in a medium bowl and taste to adjust the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate if not using right away.\nToss the salad ingredients with the broccoli then stir in the dressing. (I use less dressing than the recipe makes - as shown in the photos, but you may want to use it all.) Serve.\nRefrigerate any leftovers up to 5 days. Makes 7 cups at 1 cup per serving.\n*Use regular sugar if not following a low carb or sugar free diet.\nYet again another winner! I was looking for a recipe that is similar to a broccoli salad dish I used to get for lunch at a pizza place near where I used to work. This one fits the bill and then some. This will be in my recipe rotation for sure \u2013 thank you again for your wonderful recipes and website!\nThis was the best salad I\u2019ve had in a very long time! Husband requested again for the next nights dinner!\nYum! Another winning recipe. This is perfect for summer. Everyone loved it. I made it according to directions, but added an additional tablespoon of lemon juice to thin the dressing a little. I also used grated cheese because that\u2019s what I had on hand. Thank you!\nIs the serving size one cup?\nIf I\u2019m preparing this to serve the next day, is it ok to mix dressing with veggies or should I wait until next day?\nLooks delicious! The article doesn\u2019t repeat Amish broccoli cauliflower salad enough, IMO.\nSuch a delicious salad! Worth making!\nThanks so much Anita for bringing this comment over from Facebook. I\u2019m glad you liked the recipe. Enjoy your week! ?",

    "text": "There was a small town near the shores of the sea; it was a topical climate with mixture of occasional rainfall, hot summer & even pleasant atmosphere with low heat & humidity. The whole town was encircled with the backwaters of the rivers. With such a classic whether there was also a short coming which could wipe out the whole town. The tornado\u2019s quite regularly hit the surrounding towns so the impact of it would hit this small town too. Owing to the increasing trouble of these the people had started to flee from here. While there were people in towns who were the survivors of these who took shelter in this town.\nToday two different people both who were survivors of the same town moved into this new place but both were strangers & poles apart. One was calm & patient while the other was fierce & impatient but both were always inevitable & destructive in nature if meddled with, with a slight deviation, the calm one had the ability to choose either go ahead & wreck everything but the fierce person didn\u2019t had that choice once a step taken forward has to feel the burnt.\nEven if these two people\u2019s ways were different and always repulsive in nature, they both were away from their people it was a test of survival for them in this place. They had none to share what they felt, none to listen to their talks, none to see their pain hidden in their heart. But destiny could not stop itself posing them infront of each other. He, who was fire and she, who was water did face each other will they ever overcome there obstacles & blend in one another without terminating the other.\nSeeing is believing is said for the human sense sight but at this time of the day when darkness is all you could see around and light is something alien and hard to visualise what is there in front of you that doesn\u2019t mean you are lost or blind? Just like everyone my other senses come to my rescue. Exactly now when I cannot see anything through my eyes I could hear the roars of the ocean everytime it hit the banks indicating I am standing right infront of the vast expanse of the ocean. Petrichor, the scent of rain filled my lungs predicting the approaching rain, the touch of which would cease my burning but I am not ready to taste the freedom from this fire. In addition to these I know how to eradicate the darkness as I have the capacity to turn on the light even at the darkest times of life.\nThe rain can come down to the earth anytime and I have to take shelter before that but still I wait at the banks waiting for the darkness to break into dawn. This has been my routine from past week to sprint around the seashore of this sea at the darkest hour before the dawn and wait for the moment of darkness breaking into the dawn. To watch the sun to gain its position high in the sky, paint his colors over the world showing his supremacy to kill darkness of life. It is not only the sun but also me who feels that has spread my color all over the world.\nSlowly the sun made its way out of his den painting the whole sky bright redish yellow with its rays. Consuming the gloomy night and spreading the light bringing new hope & a beginning of bright fresh life. Once I had witnessed the magnificent sight of sunrise my concentration went towards my sense which had alerted about the approaching rain. But now there was no sign of it, that left me astonished as rain is one thing I just hate it and my senses have never been wrong in identifying them. Leaving that thought aside I make my way back to the hostel which has become my new home from where I will have to attend my first day of my master\u2019s classes today.\nNot before I had turned my eyes get struck to the sight of a girl in bluish white suit running away something was there about her unknown which made me watch her till she disappeared from my vision. I have been coming here from past 5 days but never did I saw any girl at this time of the hour. She did turn back once but I could not see her face. Just then I heard my cell beep reminding me of the time & I headed back still I couldn\u2019t stop myself to watch at the way she ran off.\nSome things never change every where the seniors welcoming the juniors especially in there own innovative way. I had just entered the gates of my college when a group of people naming themselves as seniors blocked my way. They were many more already in queues who were dancing as puppets of seniors. I had a strong urge to teach them a good lesson but I couldn\u2019t just barge in and destruct everything but that would only catch the attention of everyone. Now itself I can feel many eyes on me, that always annoy me.\nAgainst my wishes I simply follow there orders to stand in the queue and wait for my turn to come. Just then there was absolute silence as everyone\u2019s attention was on the entrance maybe another junior\u2019s who are trying to dorge away from these ragging session? But No. when I look at the entrance I could only see a beautiful mesmerising alluring blue eyes of the girl, they captivated me in its pools as deep as oceans that I can get lost in them. It was a picture painted in blue theme, every essence of her oozed as serene beauty. I could no longer see the world around me just her only; everything around her seems to vanish away from my view. As if in the whole world it is you and me alone, with my every breath, with my every heartbeat clearly wanting to be with you. Her earrings kissed her cheeks everytime she kept walking her bangles made sounds of waves in the ocean which was matching her light blue & white mixed dress. Is she the same one whom I saw in the beach today, looks like she is as even at that time she wored the same dress, the same gait, the same care free strides. Today I felt like I got a whole new world to live in.\nI don\u2019t know when my legs take me away from the crowd towards the object of my interest but I was pulled back by something. When I turn to see what that was I saw it was the guy next to me who pulled me back, he was saying something which I failed to hear it. I turned back my gaze to her; she was not there; I turn around everywhere only to find her in front of those seniors. I moved in a way to have clear view of her face without any interruption. Her eyes had a gleam of naughtiness which I didn\u2019t know for what.\nI felt another nudge in my hand to jolt me into the reality. It was again the same guy but now I heard him say \u201cMan, what are you doing come back and stand here, don\u2019t mess with seniors. See how these girls got them in trouble.\u201d The word Girls made me look at them again to find another girl beside her. All of them were watching her ignoring the pleasant beauty of mine. They were questioning them, that is when I got to know her name is Geet & the girl whom I just noticed her name is Pari.\nGeet, the name rang in my ears inveigling my heart with unknown bliss. Such a melodious name she has got that I could only hear and speak her name throughout the remaining life of mine. My heart was showing its presence more than ever with her first visual itself, weaving many desires which could bind me into something which I never was bound to. Thoughts are flying high freeing it self from the strings of my mind. Spirit is flowing in a direction which it had never crossed but it surged without bothering about any hindrance. Wish I could just embrace this moment in myself, to witness a new facet of the dreams. Her eyes were revealing more than she could every voice out surprising me at the things which it could conceal. I was eager to be with her which made my heart to live.\nDilon mein tum apni betabiyan leke chal rahe ho.\nMy revive was broken when the guy next to me was biting his nails in nervousness as he was worried for the girl next to Geet, as he was muttering \u201cPlease God save Pari from these ragging\u2019s\u201d but what I saw actually amazed me as that girl Pari stood fearless while my Geet stood behind her hiding herself from the situation. Such a contrary thing it was happening I was not scared for Geet as I knew she could come out the situation without any help where as the guy next to me was praying for Pari while the girls were doing just the opposite. But Geet\u2019s eyes shone bright, calm & undeterred confidence trickled in her every stir though she portrayed as fearful infront of everyone. She held on to the facade of a timid girl duping around the others. Her face can deceive everyone but her eyes couldn\u2019t as they told every story of hers. She was not a meek girl, none could scrum her into doing things against her wishes, but why does she have to do things like that.\nApparently the situation in the hand was the senior\u2019s portrayed themselves as generous enough to give us the option to whether we want to get ragged or not. Well that was not a real option though as a person would be asked to light the candle once they did it they would say since you have lighted it that means you have accepted to be ragged. So now the candle was placed in the middle of the stand and the girls were asked to light that. I was more interested to see the play as I read her eyes which had the mischievous glint in it. And just I guessed the fun started Geet\u2019s face turned was something everyone could not miss as it turned pale with fear and she clutched Pari\u2019s hand & fainted next second.\nFor a second even I got worried but then the wink confirmed all my doubts. Getting the clue Pari played along shouting \u201cGeet\u2026\u2026.what happened Geet\u2026get up\u2026 get up\u2026. Please someone get some water.\u201d After a while she stood drawing everyones attention to herself. When the seniors questioned her, the reply just shook everyone but I was just lost in that melody and couldn\u2019t stop the smile. Geet replied as a scared kitten shuttering and trying to hard to form even a word that \u201cI burnt it \u2026. I burnt it\u201d. Well ever Pari was confused so enquired \u201cwhat did you burn Geet.\u201d \u201cB\u2026..B\u2026\u2026Blub\u201d But looks like seniors were not falling for her drama as she was asked to light the candle now.\nI was now curious to know more about her plan as the naught sparkle twinkled in her eyes. She with trembling fingers tried to light the candle but stick failed to burn. Geet said \u201cIt is not burning so can I leave for the class sir.\u201d Finally not able to withstand the bugging kitten they let go of her. We will trap her someother time is what I heard a senior whisper into another senior. Her eyes showed she had won this play but that play was not only for her but for everyone there. With a confident & smiling face she left, actually she was concealling more may be she would have danced at her victory but stayed quite because of the people around her.\nAfter she left what happened was really a boon to others as none were able to light the candle with the sticks and were given a green signal to leave to class without any interruption as none of the juniors revealed that the stick had been damp. Actually what had happened was when Geet had feel on the ground the box had feel down in moist grass, which none of them saw at that time. Now the seniors were getting suspicious why none are able to light it are they acting? Then one of them noticed the wetness of the sticks. So when it was my turn they changed the rule if you light it only then you will be set free.\nI never had lost any game or battle then how could I just bow down when it was the question of lighting a candle. I made my hands covered there vision of the candle and the stick and within seconds I lit the candle without any trouble. What did they thought that this is the only stick through which the light could be generated. There are other ways to do that & winning over me is not going to happen ever. Without any further delay I dropped the match box in the nearby bin & went to the class with a stride which meant not to be stopped by anyone.\nI was joined by the guy who came running towards me while he said \u201cHey man, slow down, how did you do that\u201d. I didn\u2019t stop but started to move towards my designated class. When he came in front of me introducing himself \u201cHi, I am Yash and you are\u201d \u201cMaan\u201d was the only thing which I said and entered my class to see Geet in the same class of mine.\nAnother lecture starts from today, well that is one thing I always disliked but still I have never let the other person to feel that I am not one of the keen listener as I don\u2019t ignore them but just bear there words which some or the other time has been useful. This time I had a silver lining say it a distraction or attraction which would last for atleast a little while.\nI entered the class to witness Geet who sat at the front bench with her was Pari, looks like both are friends that they are sticking together. Class was almost full any time the classes would start as the time to start was nearing. I sat away from everyone as I was never a man who needed company.\nMy loneliness didn\u2019t last for long as it was accompanied by the slim nerd with broad forehead and wide cheek bones that narrow to a small chin with the naroow frame spectacles guy Yash I wished it was Geet beside me but this time I have to bear with this one as the guy, yes Yash was behind me and had followed me to the place where I had selected to sit. Well there was a special thing at this position and that was the view I would get, from here I could see the professors & behind the dias was a glass on which the image I could see was of the reflection of Geet.\nTime passed a person came said something and then my eyes went back to Geet who was busy in writing and then she was lost in seeing something when I glanced where she was looking at I saw some other person who stood at the podium. I wonder where the other person went but before I could ponder about that my eyes went on the pen which was just about to touch the curvy glossy lips of hers.\nConstant bugging of Yash gained my attention as he was mentioning something about some Economics, business and management I glared back at him to stop him from irritating me. As I take a quick look at the platform to witness yet another different person there. Have I started seeing things, was that a mirage or did the face of the person change like chameleon?\nI wanted to see what was happening around so I kept watching him but as the person was a lean bald guy he wasn\u2019t covering the glass behind giving me more access t0 my distraction she was time & again glancing over her lace tied around her wrist. It took a minute more to realise she was getting bored maybe that\u2019s why she was checking the time. That is when I checked the time which said 3 and half hours has been passed since I have been sitting here in this place. That means this is the 4th class of the day & I haven\u2019t heard a word from anyone.\nSuddenly Geet\u2019s face had shone and next second there was a long ring indicating the end of the first session and once the unknown professor left the room she & Pari flew from there may be they were hungry. Half n hour of break like everyone I too headed towards the canteen to check what I can get to fill my appetite. I had got one plate of food and sat away from the crowd when I saw my hearts leisure pursuit the blue girl getting her plate filled with food.\nI saw them looking at the whole canteen to check for a place just then Yash who was just behind them showed the table where I am sitting. He wanted to watch her everymove but staring like that when the other person was watching straight back at you was not manners and that too when I held the fire to consume her.\nMy eyes were unwilling to obey my order to look anywhere but her. Then somehow I managed to concentrate on the food but it was just for a second then it was back on her. Fortunately this time she was looking at something else at the other end. She was looking at that direction more intently making my inside to burn. I turned my gaze towards her vision and that enraged me again as Geet was looking at the seniors and one of them who was leading the ragging session was heading to our table. I wouldn\u2019t mind breaking his bones or even burning him to show him the glimpse of hell.\nHe was just a feet away from his table when the ground under him vanished as he lost balance and swan through the air bang his nose to the ground. He was carrying a plate of food he had picked it up on his way and all of it he had been carrying in his hand fell on his head and finally even the plate hit his head giving him the award he deserved. That\u2019s when I noticed the wet floor and the caution board kept to be careful as the floor was slippery.\nA slight giggle caught my ears out of the whole laugh going around the canteen and that was from none other than the girl who sat infront of me. She was trying very hard not to laugh as it would only instigate the others and bring us under their scanner. But even then she couldn\u2019t stop the smile that escaped against her wishes and adored her lips. The twinkle in her eyes which held the power to hypnotise even a saint.\nIt was the first time she sat so close to me and I was failing to stick to my previous decision of not to stare at her but when did the heart listen when God\u2019s such a exquisite creation was right before my eyes. She had her eyes fixed on the table I just didn\u2019t know what is so interesting out there on it while I couldn\u2019t move my gaze from her. I wished she looked up to me at least once so that I could read what she was thinking. Maybe she didn\u2019t noticed me till now as she was busy with the laugh she got to see here but before I could make that statement sink into my heart she raised her lashes to meet my molten eyes to lose the whole world around us or to find a new way together.\nChange is the only thing which is constant in life and is the same thing which I am experiencing now. My sense\u2019s which has always been active in alerting me of my surroundings has changed its allegiance. My eyes never leaves the sight of her as it only tries to find more about her while I always search to hear her melodious voice in every sound that hits my ears, I wait for the moment of slight touch of her veil every time we have bump into one another. It takes every ounce of my will to resist from tasting this forbidden fruit. She is all bent to change me as she smells like a dew drop making me to hate the thought why I hated that before.\nThe fact which I always certain about eradicating the darkness & lighting it seems to be lost with the way my life had taken a turn. My day which always used to start with the sprinting before the breaking of dawn to keep me fit and focussed has also changed. Now after sprinting I would do my exercise using fire to help me keep focus on the issue that is on the hand. Every day I try new ways with fire I would light up the edges of the stick with fire and swinging the blazing stick in different ways so as to wipe out that vision which has plastered to my eyes.\nThat day when our eyes had met, the world around me had just ceased to exist. Those deep blue eyes held me captive in her spell that I felt I wandered into a place where every thing was so serene that I didn\u2019t know whether I was lost before or am I getting lost now. I was looking deep into violet & green mixed pupils of her to find what all secrets that could unfold infront of me. But what I found was a haze image of person\u2019s face which started to disturb the tranquilly of those orbs a bit later what I saw was it was not just the disturbance but vanquishing the glow with the flame of that persons mere presence which turned into my face. That was the harsh reality of mine which broke my trance and I had left the table in a rush leaving everyone to ponder anything what they wish.\nI would now rather light up the whole place to make me remember the fact of my presence in anyones life would only harm everyone. How could I forget why I am all alone? I break one another stick that was in my hand with the rage which had only amplified the concealed fire in me. I have led lonely life because of this reason, when ever I have lost focused I have not only lost my dearest and nearest but also have felt the burnt of it my own self. How unlucky am I to even not retain a companion for even a small part of this long life. With these thoughts cruising in my mind everytime I would never know when the dawn breaks & the day starts. But with my starting ignorance with the surroundings one had not left to remind me about my college and that was Yash who used to call me with his stupid problems.\nExactly now I got a call from Yash making me realise the time as even the sun elevated high in the sky failed to be gain my attention as I was busy fight with the inner battle. I switched on the Bluetooth and without a second delay he started his cribbing.\nThat reminds me of the act of last night when I had held the light in my hand & had snapping the fingers lighting it & switching it off with my thoughts running about the past and trying to get the things straight in present.\n\u201c15 minutes.\u201d I reply and make my way to start yet another day just like past 8 months but before I leave this shore I put of the fire which I had set around the place. Out of all these things against me this is one thing that I am glad of this deserted place to give me my privacy.\nAs always my eyes search that place where I had seen her on the first day but as every other day even today I couldn\u2019t see her there maybe it was just by chance that she was here that day. I again console my heart which still wants to see her against my will. And in these 8 months every single day didn\u2019t end without an encounter of ours but every time I shifted my course away from her as those eyes held something which could not be comprehend. During the classes I try to gauge her reactions but she didn\u2019t let me through her lashes making it difficult to read her.\nThings which made these encounter possible were Yash & Pari and their budding love story. There talks left me know more about Geet, how she is, how even she came here after losing her family. How lonely she has become now and how she is coping with her life. What her aims are, how she has influenced Pari to be more focused about the future. I get to hear each and every word about them from Yash.\nThere is not a single place in the college which doesn\u2019t remind me of our encounter and just a week ago when Geet was searching for Pari near this fountain at the entrance of the college where I am standing that was the time we met again face to face to let me read her mind through her own blue eyes.\nThis time when the cover of her lashes had been shed for my view all I could see was the same mischief gleam in it. But what is she upto now, did that senior again became the scapegoat of her acts. She has been enjoying that senior\u2019s state to an extent which none knew except me as always after every fall of his she had walked away with a winning stride. One thing which even I didn\u2019t know was did she do anything which always landed him in trouble or was that a pure coincidence that whenever she was present he was embarrassed with one or the other thing.\nLast time I had accompanied Yash to the mall as girls wanted to do there shopping while Yash wanted to join them and I also went along with him. Once they had roamed alround the mall we had settled down in the food court to fill the hunger of stomach. The seating arrangement was in a semi circle round the table and at one end was Geet next to her was Pari and next was Yash, after him I sat.\nI smiled looking at the them planning for the seminar which I didn\u2019t even know there was I never had to bothered for any academic activity as even before I realise the need of the work it would have been done for me too. Yash was someone who used to do it for me I never did ask him for but he simple did it for me and then it become a silent treaty that he used to hand over all the assignments to me. I could have asked him the reason for it but then I never indulged in talking with anyone not even Yash, who was my hostel roommate.\nPari loved Yash but always gets irritated with his \u201cI am scared attitude\u201d college works were not an issue but handling the world or people was something he always held a back foot. I guess this was the reason Yash always used to be with me scared to be alone, scared that he might just get into trouble and I tagged with him because he never asked any questions about me but just used to bug me with non stop talking about the college or Pari or her friend Geet. That was much more than a vital reason to actually tolerate him and his actions.\nThere was sudden hustle bustle in the food court, apparently some waiter was pushed by someone making all the food in his hand to spilled on the ground and that person was none other than our same senior who had lead our ragging session. The owner was all set to bash the waiter & dismiss him from the job as he thougt the waiter couldn\u2019t even handle his customers properly, creating disturbance to them and also damaging his places aesthetics.\nAnd this senior of ours who was having fun in this trouble just was leaving creating the mess and while crossing over the table next us the kid who sat there was supposed to have her milk in the bottle but the kid opened the cap in a way that all the milk erupted out of it spilling it all over the place along with the wetting the pants of our beloved senior in turn making him embarrass infront of all the people. At that time her eyes showed \u201cyou deserve it\u201d look.\nToday too her eyes conveyed the same thing to me but who deserves that, was that me or was that someone else. I was still searching for answers when a loud laughter hit my ears and that was of Yash & Pari who came running & laughing even before I could ask them they started to narrate that the gardener was having trouble why water stopped suddenly coming in his pipes while watering the plants and then he tried to twist them in all direction water gushed out like a stream which unfortunately showered on our same darling senior.\nOnce Yash was here I moved out to our hostel when Yash again started his pleading to accompany him to Pari\u2019s house as she had challenged him \u201cYash if you love me you have to come to my hime without getting scared of my owner who stayed next door. Only then I will talk to you.\u201d Did I needed this pleadings no defiantly no, but still how would I just give in so I gave him \u201cI am not interested\u201d look and then I finally agreed to him.\nWe knocked at the door of the girl\u2019s home late at 12 midnight as it was quite a distance we had to travel. There was hesitation quite visible on Pari\u2019s face as she opened the windows to check who is banging the door at this hour. I could clearly see one was shocked while the other pretended to be shocked as she was not afraid of facing any situation. As it was a season of rain many would come inside the front yard for shelter but now it wasn\u2019t raining either and even if it was entertaining an outsider at this hour was not safe.\nWe stood at a distance so when she checked the window none were visible, then she had a confused look thinking who banged on the door. Just when she thought to close the window and return to bed we came out of the shadows scaring her a bit as she asked who it is. But only thing she heard was her own sound and crackle sound of the dry leaves.\nSurprise was the word Yash screamed making her squeal in shock but then she was happy to find her love leaving his inhabitation self.\nSurprise was the word Yash screamed making her squeal in shock but then she was happy to find her love there leaving his inhabitation self and visiting her.\n\u201cYash is this the way you come. There is a calling bell which you could always use then why were you banging the door like that. You just scared the hell out of us.\u201d Pari growled on Yash.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why she gets scared suddenly of such little things.\u201d said Pari referring to Geet\u2019s action.\n\u201cYash left a sigh once Geet left as he can have his little talk with Pari now without interruption. Now you will do as I say\u201d Yash whispered.\nLooking at them I thought they need a little more privacy so\u2026.\nI left that place at once and started to move backwards when I heard something rather say some sound. That made me realised that the path I choose leads to the back yard of the house where Geet went. The thought that she is there was enough for me to move more faster my mind constantly warned me not to go and face at this time but when did mind had any say in front of this heart.\nMy luck was not with me today as suddenly there was lighting followed by a noisy thunder. Normally boys liked these situations where girls would be scared and cling to boys but here it was a different story as I despised rain. Seeing the pouring rain my legs freeze at the place I was safe under the shelter in the pitch darkness where no one knew anyone would exist. Even in the most solitary life I have an angel who had descended from the heaven whom I could gaze till my hearts content.\nGeet was in her light violet velvet suit stood admiring the sky above. I stood as far as possible but my eyes could view her from head to toe, I guess she was also standing below some shelter as there was not a drop of rain falling on her. She was not only admiring it but also waiting for the rain to fall as the moment she stretched her palm a drop fell on it, she did the same again and again collecting the drops of the rain in her palm. It looked as if the rain was waiting for the orders of her to fall. Once it was full she let them drop on the ground making the sound like pearls were falling off from the necklace as they didn\u2019t just fall but also they had another path to follow.\nShe was the commander in chief imposing the flow of rain. Slowly the drops of rain increased & made its way from her shoulders to her long silky hands gliding over them to reach the small little fingers of her just before they descended to reach there fellow droplets. If that was the sight I beheld unknown to her next set of her acts just made my insides move as molten lava.\nThe water which blessed themselves touching her forehead slid through the sides measuring the length of her sleek neck before they disappeared into the fabric. The view brought him of my revive giving me a reality check about my act. I was not supposed to look at her like this minutely. She has always hid behind the mask of a meek girl and now thinking no one is here she would have let those masks off her face.\nShe might have not been this free had she known about my presence here. But I didn\u2019t have it in me to turn back from her. This time I wanted her to decide and it would be easy on me to feel her rejection than turning back from her. With this decision I let my legs lead towards the magnetic pull.\nI couldn\u2019t have stepped in rain too so I stood at the rim of the shelter making my presence known to her. Passing the message towards her clearly that she is not alone to let her barriers down and baring her oneself to me. She stood in the middle, hands out stretched to let the rain drench her. Even after making my presence evident she didn\u2019t deterred was she so involved in her own world that what is happening around, who is there beside her didn\u2019t matter or was she giving me a treat by letting me to witness her subtle movements of unparalleled grace.\nRain which had drenched her whole form gave a shiny effect to her. With a determination which none could stop her to express herself today neither the rain nor my presence. She bent her back in a semi circle swinging her hands in a way that looked like a white rainbow twinkling in the moon light. Was she dancing with rain or was rain dancing with her, was she following it or was that following her moves was all I could ponder about as she and rain matched steps with each other.\nUnknown to me \u201cGeet\u201d came out from my lips it came out just as a whisper and I doubt whether my own ears heard it or not. But as the name left my lips the rain just came to end like it was waiting for me to utter and it would stop and with not a drop of rain pouring her whole concentration turned to me. I stood there waiting for her reaction, would she walk away as I do or\u2026. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. She slowly closed the distance between us and stood right in front of me.\nHer eyes held an unknown compassion which I could not understand. I felt a sudden chill spreading around me was it the dip in the temperature or was it her who was cooling my fire in me. My eyes closed for a brief second to hide the things which it may give away if I look deep into the blue ones it may questioned me anything. There were many things which my heart wanted to convey but words were just not enough to express them. Many emotions were binding me with you bring in a new flavour sweeping us into a different world. This is the riddle which could not be hidden within me or with in her or even the world.\nI was still entranced in her when I felt her chilled hands touch my cheeks sending shiver down my body. It took only a second to ignite the fire in me; it took lot of efforts to break the shackles to let my hand to stretch so that I could feel that creamy skin. She closed her eyes to engrave the feel of me on her hand, so did I wanted to engrave it. I was just an inch away when she trembled back and before I could comprehend anything or hold her she collapsed on the ground & like how the water gushes out when the gates of the dam are opened the rain poured out on her.\nWhat happened was something has happened with me many times before too when ever I have left my confines things has gone messy. That is the reason why I have to be alone & none are allowed to be with me. My mother left me giving birth to me to live in this world all alone; my father was there only till that another natural calamity which shook more than half of the village when I was a small kid. From that time all I have led is a life alone each day was like a year or even more than that.\nRelatives were there to support me but even that didn\u2019t last for more than few days as they would fell into deep troubles due to me. So I had spent most of my life in an orphanage far away from everyone who was my family once. This was my curse which I am still burdened with. And today that has spread to Geet, she fell the moment I thought to ignore my curse but it was all present to remind me of the repercussions if avoided.\nI still stood the same way gazing at her fallen state; I couldn\u2019t gather enough courage to even check her. What if she also just left because of my mistake? It would have been better to be away than to live in guilt for becoming an endangered curse to someone else. With the sudden enormous sound of water gained the attention of Pari & Yash so they came out to check the reason for it and all they could see was Geet lying in the pool of water while I had lost my voice to tell anything to them.\nI started to take my steps away from her whereas Pari was trying to revive Geet by patting her cheeks. Yash asked her to pull under the shelter first so that she wouldn\u2019t catch cold. They tried to rub her legs & hands it was turning little blue due to chillness of water. Yash looked back at me to ask what happened but what would I reply, there was nothing to tell it was all my fault to have agreed with him to accompany Yash to her place.\nMy strides were moving fast to just hide myself away from everyone especially from those blue eyes mermaid of my life. I push all the things in front of me & put everything on fire with my own hands but would that reduce the blaze in me. Ripping of my self also didn\u2019t reduce the helplessness in me. Why should I be compled to live a life like this with no love no happiness all alone nothing pleasing can exist around me? Why it is that anything that wants to give me bit contentment would turn into ashes before I could embrace it. Why can\u2019t I hold a little bliss in my palm?\nAll I had heard was they were taking her to the nearby doctor, I so wanted to check on her but it was best with me not going near her. I waited at the shores waiting for the sun to break the darkness, which was actually trying to consume me within it. After what seems like eternity I just couldn\u2019t wait more but wanted to know if she was fine, I decided I would only see from far & then will move out before anyone would actually notice my presence.\nI stood at the doorway hearing that melodious voice of speaking to the doctor which was a relief till I heard there talks. The doctor was quite upset about something but what was the fault of Geet in all these things which happened.\n\u201cGeet, I am telling you last time you have to be careful, I can\u2019t hide these things everytime. It was just pure luck that your friends bought you to me, what would have happened if they would have taken you to other doctor.\u201d Doctor was scolding sternly.\n\u201cDoc, I would have managed it.\u201d Geet answered meekly.\n\u201cRight the way you just managed it today. I have answered others as you got dehydrated but I want answers from you now? What happened & how did it happen if you had taken all the precautions.\u201d Doc questioned.\n\u201c2 days, what will I do here for 2 days? I am perfectly fine & I would like to take your leave now as I need to attend the class.\u201d Replied shocked Geet on the sudden order passed by her doctor but when did she listen to others.\n\u201cNo, you are my friend, so bye.\u201d Geet stromed out of the room after saying that.\nThere talk left me in thinking what was it that they were talking about was she hiding something or is she under some medication due to some disease. But if I question the doctor she would definitely not spit out the truth. Doctor must have known Geet for a quite a period and that\u2019s why she was so comfortable & then also she hid the truth with Yash & Pari also that too even before she consulting Geet. I should follow her to know more but after what happened yesterday night I need to be very careful & stay away from her.\nI have been observing her more meticulously from past few hours but nothing actual changed in her ways neither in action nor in words. Still we didn\u2019t speak neither she nor Yash or Pari actually asked me about that night. It was as if nothing happened, don\u2019t know what Geet said to them but they were actually being careful with Geet, making sure that she had lot of liquids. They didn\u2019t let her give presentations in seminar also but only person who regretted that was me as I couldn\u2019t hear her.\nYash asked me to help them in the last seminar and the group discussions for the year before college breaks for the exams so that Geet could take proper rest. I agreed but I didn\u2019t know what I am supposed to do so he gave some notes which I had to go through & speak about them. Seminar was said to be on one of the topics in some subject which we read but the group discussion was just a practice session so that everyone would get good exposure to the presentation skills. I actually wondered what am I going to do as I had not an iota of idea how these are done but this would help Geet is all I know so I had to do it.\nSeminar finished & I don\u2019t exactly remember what all I have to say. Seeing my capabilities with words they had given me a small part. Was that a 5 min material which I finished it in 2 minute or was that only a 1 minutes one for which I too 2. But whatever it was that ended without much hanky panky. Well one hurdle was crossed & the other awaited. Yes the group discussion would start in a while, groups were made. Pari, I & few other class mates were selected and made the group. The topic was read out it was \u201cMyth\u201d.\nWith that few started to oppose it & many started to agree with it. But when I heard what all they were discussing I couldn\u2019t stop my self from putting my view in it.\n\u201cHow could you say that God is a myth\u201d I questioned.\n\u201cIf he was there then people would not have suffered unnecessarily, take your example are you not an orphan\u2026 why?? because God took away your parents that too in a natural calamity which was controlled by God.\u201d Pari replied.\n\u201cIt was not the God who controlled these calamities they are done by the people who are posses the power to protect the nature and people in this world.\u201d I counter replied.\n\u201cOh you are a believer of those grandma bedtime stories in which God entrusts some power to three people who were termed as guards of the earth but these people quarrelled among themselves to attain the supremacy over the human beings. If only one is left they would be invincible who could be termed as equal to God.\u201d Pari questioned.\nThe whole discussion was heating up between Pari & Maan and everyone present there were just a mute spectators as they didn\u2019t know where it all would go to. Some had heard these stories in there childhood from there elders but then with time all these things were termed as only story.\n\u201cYes I am a believer of it but that is not the whole truth what all things they would have to undergo for being a guard is not known to many. Life span of these persons would be more than 400 years which they should be spent away from everyone if those powers are entrusted. These powers would be there curse but also a boon, which could be used to restrict many calamaties. And humans never get to know what things were averted but can only know & rememeber when these gaurds fail. Yes they fight among themselves but are these fights for gaining supremacy or to gain freedom from those things is still a mystery which none have been able to know it till now.\u201d I said.\nI would have said many more things but I was stopped by the sapphire eyed girl who pleaded me through her eyes to not say a word more and how could I utter a single word after that. My tongue was now tied with her plea so I let every other person to continue with the discussion and in no time the hour flee so did the students from the class.\nThis was the last class for the year and students would forget about all these talks is what I could wish for as many were worried about their individual exams or was excited for the farewell party of the seniors which the juniors had organised for. I don\u2019t know whether I blabbered more than required or was my speech revealed more than necessary things.\nPari responded \u201cHe started\u201d pointing all the blame towards me.\n\u201cI know who started what even I was here only. Now do you think about yourself Maan what were you doing talking all these stories.\u201d Geet turned towards me questioning but she was shocked and continued \u201cNow where did he go?\u201d as I was not there standing but had started to move out of the class saving my self from there questioning eyes.\nToday is the farewell party girls were dressed in red & white combination where as boys were in red & black combo. For a change juniors had planned to rag the seniors on there own farewell which was led by Pari & group, well I knew whose idea this would be. Time has changed so had the relations too in past 10 months seniors have become more friendly and supportive, thus playing pranks with them would not be a trouble and anyways they are leaving the institute so the coast is clear for fun.\nParty was in the open air hall in the grounds of the college which had a stage at one end where Geet was speaking to Pari who stood beside her with today\u2019s event manager & at the far end was the fountain where I stood gazing her every move. She looked angelic in that white salwar of hers as blue veil adored the slender creamy neck. Yash was running behind Pari helping her out with all his love and I was standing away from everyone feeling glad that atleast there are people whom I would love and they are infront of me.\nPeople dressed in vibrant colors were already to enjoy & have fun as the party was about to start. Whereas things don\u2019t happen as you wish for and who knows that better than me and exactly the way I had the intrusion there was a sudden hassle alround the place everyone were running into the college that\u2019s when I witnessed the tornado coming towards us.\nI stood waiting the tornado to come to me as what can it do to me carry & through me somewhere that\u2019s it right. However when it was just a yard away from the ground when it stood still as if something stopped its way. When I look around the ground there is no one present but my eyes stopped at one place where a girl lay may be unconscious and it didn\u2019t take a minute to know who that was as she is Geet only girl who was in her blue while everyone was in red & white.\nI flew away from the college far away from the place where I burnt her with my own flames as I was not able stand any more minute at that place; how long do I have to face the same thing again and again. Everytime when the sadness has engulfed me I have always consoled my heart that it isn\u2019t my mistake everyone has to go through these pains in their long-lasting life. Heavy as this heart feels now with the overwhelming emotions I stare at the Sun which is all set to take a dip in the vast expanse of ocean but now I have nothing to hold on to there is a deep stillness which has settled in me as the world has moved but I haven\u2019t.\nWith the increase in the pour even ocean seems to be more intended to swallow me within as I hit the first waves of the huge mass. It left me shocked as I could hold to anything, I felt like I am moving without my own will. Today there was only one will that was to try every possible way to put off this blaze. Even the thought has not left my mind I was hit by another way, now it seemed as if I was floating in it and next second I was submergered in it. I want to go deep into it so I tried to find the ground and started to walk into the depth of it.\nAs I stepped deep within my luck just flew away because the water which was soothing my soul just sweeped in making a space between me & the water mass. Same like Geet had created when we were in the college, was she here or was it someone else who possessed the same power. \u201cGeet \u2026\u201d my lips took her name as a whisper and just as that day today also rain which had been pouring stopped and my attention went towards the form in the shadows.\n\u201cYes \u2026 Maan we can but are you willing to be with me till the end. Will you love me without any of my ability to control water? Will you love me\u2026.?\u201d She replied with uncertainity.\n\u201cMaan, you need to let go this fear and worry nothing will happen to us. Yes, we will have to work hard to survive now.\u201d She pressed her ear to my chest while she continued \u201cBut together we will surpass every hurdle that comes in our way. This isn\u2019t yours anymore but mine now so stop troubling it.\u201d She said refering to my heart also showing her dominance over me.\n\u201cShh\u2026You don\u2019t have to voice it Maan, your face convey\u2019s it all, every thought that your heart analyzes, every notion it evaluates, every outcome it concludes. You are just as open book to me as I am to you.\u201d Geet declared her point.\nBy the time I was back Yash was up and had sat up against the rock as I hand over a bottle of water to him. He seemed surprised and undoubtly happy about something.\n\u201cYou guys are making fun of me and we are all worried for you. I wouldn\u2019t have been awake had I sleept last night, but after that storm had eloped you guys there isn\u2019t a place where we have not searched you. Today I thought lets look at the opposite direction too and here I found you guys.\u201d Yash explained the reason of his presence.\n\u201cCarry him, I can walk we will get more oppurunities going forward.\u201d Geet smiled winking at me.\nAnd today this diary answered me why I could never hear what they were worried about was that about the mess or about me contolling my powers as both could read each other face without voicing a word from their mouth. Today I am very happy reading that my parents too had powers like me, actually defeated the air power and that\u2019s why I their daughter am gifted with power of air.\nShe grew faster than we could think and tomorrow is her 18th birthday and I couldn\u2019t see her confused and worried anymore uncessarily too. Yes even her face revealed every secret of hers. And that\u2019s why I decided to place this diary in a place where she could get her hands on it.\n\u201cWhen were we separate from eachother Geet.\u201d Papa buttered Mama so easily.",

    "text": "After a four-week hiatus, the Verizon IndyCar Series roars back to life in the desert. What used to be Phoenix International Raceway is now called ISM Raceway. What does ISM stand for? Ingenuity Sun Media, of course. If that doesn\u2019t evoke fond racing memories, I\u2019m not sure what will.\nThe new name notwithstanding, IndyCar has a very rich history at Phoenix. AJ Foyt won the first Indy car race held at the D-shaped oval back in 1964. Of course, Foyt won all but three races in the thirteen race 1964 season so that shouldn\u2019t be a huge shock. In those days, the USAC Championship made two stops each year in Phoenix \u2013 generally at the beginning and end of the season. Lloyd Ruby won the season-ending race in 1964, long after Foyt had wrapped up the championship. Sadly, top-driver Bobby Marshman lost his life after a crash at Phoenix while tire testing there in late November of 1964 \u2013 just a few days after the race.\nSome of the biggest names in racing have won at Phoenix. Aside from the aforementioned Foyt and Ruby; names like Don Branson, Jim McElreath, Mario Andretti, Gary Bettenhausen, Al Unser, Swede Savage, Bobby Unser, Gordon Johncock, Johnny Rutherford, Tom Sneva, Rick Mears, Bobby Rahal, Michael Andretti, Arie Luyendyk, Emerson Fittipaldi, Helio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan and also the immortal name of Jim Guthrie \u2013 they\u2019ve all won at Phoenix. All kidding aside; except for Guthrie \u2013 that\u2019s a very impressive list that reads like a Who\u2019s Who of Indy car racing.\nPhoenix was reconfigured in 2010, mostly to handle the much heavier stock cars that prefer higher banking. The front straightaway was widened and the banking was slightly increased and converted to progressive banking. This will be the last time the track looks the way it does now. Next year, the seating will be completely different and the start/finish line will be between Turn One and the dogleg which is in what is currently called the backstretch. By moving the start/finish line, the numbering of the turns will be different as well.\nBut the biggest question looming over this weekend is whether or not IndyCar will even be back next year. This is the third year that IndyCar has returned to the 1.022 mile oval in the desert. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the current contract was a three-year deal. Track owner, ISC \u2013 a sister company to NASCAR, has a history of not being patient while IndyCar tries to build attendance at some of their tracks. Watkins Glen and Fontana have given IndyCar two chances at their tracks and the plug was recently pulled for the second time at both tracks. If this weekend\u2019s race is poorly attended, will that be it for Phoenix? If so, it hardly seems fair.\nThe date has been juggled since the series returned in 2016. It was early April two years ago, then due to the Final Four being in Phoenix last year, it was moved to later in the month. This year it returns to what is hoped to be a new traditional slot for many years to come.\nBut in order for that to happen, attendance must improve. For attendance to improve, fans need to be given a reason to come out. Quite frankly, the last two races at Phoenix have not given fans a reason to come out or return. To be kind, they have been snoozers. To be blunt, they have been stinkers.\nThe previous car in the aero kit era had so many wings and winglets all over them, they created a ton of turbulence in their wake. In short, it was very difficult for anyone to pass. The result was two years of boring one-mile processions. Experts last year told us that the new car would be much more racy at Phoenix. What we saw during February testing at Phoenix suggested otherwise. I\u2019m telling myself that it was a test when everyone was trying to emerge unscathed and that the race will be much different.\nLet\u2019s hope so. The Verizon IndyCar Series can\u2019t stand another clunker at Phoenix. They need a good race that will have everyone talking just like the race at St. Petersburg did four weeks ago. If they can see at least a decent crowd tomorrow night and a good race, the series may see a fourth year in a row at Phoenix. If Saturday night\u2019s race is a dud, this might be it at Phoenix for a while and that would be a shame.\nIndyCar needs to be at Phoenix. It is one of those tracks like Indianapolis and Milwaukee that is in the DNA of the series. It didn\u2019t upset me that much when Watkins Glen fell off the schedule last year, because IndyCar doesn\u2019t have a long history there. Since 1979, IndyCar has only run eleven races in that thirty-eight year span. Tomorrow night will be the sixty-eighth IndyCar race at ISM Raceway since 1964. That\u2019s a lot of history at one track to not be allowed to come back after the sixty-ninth.\nMy hope is a good race with a lot of twists and turns, to make people have to catch their breath when it\u2019s over.\nOne thing that might bring people out is the celebration of Mario Andretti\u2019s last IndyCar win. It took place twenty-five years ago in 1993 at Phoenix. Part of the celebration is the car that his grandson Marco Andretti will run, will have a livery very similar to Mario\u2019s Texaco-Havoline Newman/Haas car from 1993. The car looks good and a tip of the hat needs to go to Marco\u2019s sponsor Oberto. They have allowed the team to deviate from their colors and logos in order to replicate Mario\u2019s 1993 winner as closely as possible.\nSo who will win this sixty-ninth edition tomorrow night? S\u00e9bastien Bourdais was an early out last year at Phoenix, but that was no fault of his. Mikhail Aleshin decided to dive-bomb the field going into Turn Two. Bourdais was an innocent victim. I have to think that he\u2019ll do well tomorrow night.\nMy guess is that Team Penske will not stay silent two races in a row. Simon Pagenaud won here last season as Penske cars dominated the race. I\u2019m going with last year\u2019s season champ Josef Newgarden. He was rather quiet last month at St. Petersburg on his way to a seventh-place finish. I have an idea that Newgarden, nor his teammates, will not stay quiet two races in a row. I expect the defending series champion to come out swinging. Josef Newgarden will win the Desert Diamond West Valley Phoenix Grand Prix (that\u2019s a mouthful) tomorrow night.\nAfter this race, things get going for real. Next weekend the series travels to Long Beach, and two weeks from now they will be at one of my favorite tracks, Barber Motorsports Park in Leeds, Alabama \u2013 just east of Birmingham. After an off-weekend, there is the open test at IMS on April 30, which I may or may not be attending. Then the Month of May kicks off on Friday May 11 for practice for the IndyCar Grand Prix. Four days of practice on the IMS oval will be followed by two days of qualifying for the Indianapolis 500. The next weekend will be the 102nd Running of the Indianapolis 500. Then the series goes to Belle Isle and Texas before earning the next break in mid-June.\nBy then the four-week stretch we just went through with no racing will be a distant memory. After our teaser in March, I feel like IndyCar season is finally here for good. It\u2019s about time!\nThis entry was posted on April 6, 2018 at 4:04 am and is filed under IndyCar.\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. You can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\nProbably one of the most anticipated races of the season for me. I think this race will be a true test of the new aero kit, if it puts on a good race here it\u2019s a strong sign they got things right.\nI watched the \u201993 Phoenix race yesterday and there was more passing in the first 25 laps than the last two IndyCar Phoenix races combined and even though the entire field was a lap down by lap 50 every minute of the race was thrilling and exciting. We need some of that magic tomorrow night.\nMy favorite bit of Marco\u2019s tribute paint scheme is the use of Circle K essentially in place of K Mart. Dig those red Ks.\nI\u2019m looking forward to this one if only for the mystery of how the new kit will race. I actually thought the test had a few moments where the cars looked to be racing more competitively than they did the last two years.\nI thought an Oberto was a good cigar. Turns out it is a good sausage. I\u2019m looking forward to other sponsorships of this genre.\nI am about to become an octogenarian. It would bring me (and A.J.) a great deal of happiness to see him do well over there in the desert Saturday. It has become apparent to me that I will likely not outlast Mr. Anthony Joseph Foyt Jr. and I may get black flagged in my sleep some night. With that in mind, I attached one of those IMS grandstand seats to my Acorn Stair Lift. Then I put Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d on my turntable, or the sounds of a Novi or Offenhauser, and ride up to bed each night. True dat.\nCongrats Ron on your upcoming birthday. Just watched Quali and Mr. Foyt looks well after his bee encounter.\nThank you young lady. I also watched Quali and Mr. Foyt does indeed look well. I think the race tomorrow will be very interesting and fun to watch. This is a track that Seb can do well on, so he is my pick. I watched him run away and hide from the rest of the field at the Milwaukee Mile a few years ago. Milwaukee is a track with the same degree of difficulty as Phoenix.\nI was thrilled for Seb. Here\u2019s to him to have a great day out there tonight.\nI think it more than cool that Paul Newman\u2019s daughter Clea will be serving as Grand Marshall for the race. My source for that is the track news site.\nBryon Sperber has invited one of Paul Newman\u2019s daughters to be the Grand Marshall for tonight\u2019s race. That is very appropriate and just damned cool for Bryon to do that.\nWell, I failed to finish reading this blog post before the race in which George\u2019s prediction was fulfilled.",

For heavy work special brass plates are obtainable for this purpose; one plate is let flush into the upper piece and the other plate into the lower piece.\nBattening .\u2014A good method of joining cross battens to drawing boards and other wide surfaces is shown here. After boring for the screws, slots are cut so as to allow the screws to move along the slots when shrinkage takes place. In a similar method is applied to secure the drawer bottom to the drawer back. If shrinkage takes place in the drawer bottom and it leaves the groove in the drawer front, the screws are slackened, the drawer bottom is knocked up into the groove, and the screws again inserted. For drawing boards, etc., specially made elliptical-shaped slotted brass socket cups are made to receive the screw heads.",

    "text": "The 17-year-old comes from a family of art collectors.\nCarson Guo\u2019s recent acquisition of a series of skateboard decks from the streetwear brand Supreme began with, of all things, a pair of chopsticks.\nTwo years ago, the Vancouver-based collector spent around $115 for a pair of Supreme chopsticks. That purchase was just the start for Guo. Last month, the 17-year-old, who used to work part-time at a streetwear store, spent $800,000 on 248 skateboard decks, which had been released by the brand over a 20-year period between 1998 and 2018. Originally collected by Ryan Fuller, these boards include pieces that blur the line between fashion and art, featuring work by artists like Damien Hirst, George Condo, and Jeff Koons. There are also two Louis Vuitton decks\u2014the first, in 2000, lifted the luxury label\u2019s logo without permission, and later, the two labels partnered for the much-hyped fall 2017 collection.\nGuo may be young, but he comes from a family of art collectors. \u201cMy father is a collector who buys from auction houses and galleries. My older sister graduated with a degree in art history from UBC, and she is my father\u2019s adviser in his acquisition of fine art. She is also a collector of fine art, and the two of them are my mentors,\u201d Guy told Robb Report via e-mail. The family owns pieces by towering artists like Picasso and Monet. The teen collector\u2019s proclivities, however, veer more toward street culture.\nAs you might expect from the man who bought Supreme chopsticks, Guo is no stranger to the New York\u2013based brand. He says he owns around 200 items from Supreme, \u201cincluding a few skateboards, some clothes, and many accessories.\u201d But his favorite piece? A Supreme x Everlast punching bag, which is available on the website Kixclusive right now for a cool $15,000. \u201cThe piece is very rare, and I think it is absolutely fascinating that Supreme collaborated with Everlast,\u201d Guo said.\nAs for his most recent acquisition, Guo said the decks will go on view in an upcoming gallery in Vancouver for both hypebeasts and art connoisseurs alike to enjoy.",

    "text": "New York, NY - January 15, 2014 - Today, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer announced that he has received a commitment that John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) will be assigned additional customs agents as the result of increased appropriations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill. This bill has boosted CBP\u2019s funding by $165.7 million in order for the agency to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide. Specifically, the bill increases CBP\u2019s overall budget to $10.6 billion, which is over $220 million more than FY2013. Schumer explained that $165.7 million of the new funding was explicitly prescribed \u201cfor the purpose of hiring, training, and equipping new U.S. customs and border protection offices.\u201d During a confirmation hearing today, Schumer secured a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske, who is currently undergoing the confirmation process to be Commissioner of CBP, that he would commit to bringing an adequate portion of these new agents and resources to JFK once he has been confirmed.\nIn September 2013, Schumer made an appeal to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement new measures that would help alleviate incredibly long lines for travelers using customs at JFK and he continued his push at a confirmation hearing today for Kerlikowske. Schumer\u2019s appeal comes after a report revealed that customs lines at JFK Airport were among the longest wait times in the country. According to the report, the average delay during peak hours could be two hours or more.\nOn July 1, 2013, at 6 am, the wait was 140 minutes.\nOn August 3, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 120 minutes.\nOn August 24, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 3 hours.\nSchumer has long advocated measures to decrease these wait times, including a personal call in September to then-Acting DHS Secretary Rand Beers, during which Schumer asked Beers to approve and install new automated Passport kiosks, as well as assign additional Custom and Border Patrol agents at JFK. Schumer also urged his colleagues to boost funding for the Customs and Border Protection in the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill, above the current 2013 levels and called current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to press his case.\nToday, Schumer announced that the recently released appropriations agreement called for $165.7 million to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide, and that he has received a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske that, when confirmed as Commissioner of CBP, he will assign an adequate portion of these new agents to JFK. These additional agents will enable the airport to decrease wait times and continue to be a major economic driver.",
