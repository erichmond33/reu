The intense heat on Venus makes it the hottest planet in our solar system, even hotter than Mercury. If Venus had an atmosphere similar to Earth’s then you would expect Venus’ mean temperature to be 499 K (1.74 x 287) rather than 735 K which is 1.47 (735 / 499) times hotter than it should be. Furthermore, the extreme temperature on Venus, which is significantly higher than what would be anticipated based on its atmospheric composition alone, can be attributed to the greenhouse effect. Venus' dense atmosphere consists mostly of carbon dioxide, creating a potent greenhouse effect that traps heat and leads to a runaway greenhouse effect.
