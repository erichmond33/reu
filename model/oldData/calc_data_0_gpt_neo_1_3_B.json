    "text": "Are film trailers spoiling movies?\nIn April we asked if high ticket prices were ruining your visits to the cinema. Yes, you said overwhelmingly. But something else has put a strain on my relationship with the cinema \u2013 and it\u2019s not the popcorn.\nHave you ever gone to your local cinema to watch a new film only to feel you\u2019ve seen it before? I know I have. \u2018Spoilerific\u2019 film trailers are now often so detailed it seems hardly worth watching the movie itself.\nImagine if the trailer for Casablanca told you whether Ingrid Bergman went off with Humphrey Bogart or Paul Henreid at the end. Or if the trailer for Citizen Kane revealed just what the dying man meant when he muttered the word \u2018Rosebud\u2019.\nAnd it seems that even some film directors agree. Colin Trevorrow, director of new film, Jurassic World, has said he think that trailers have shown far more of the film than he would have wanted.\nIn the last couple of months, I\u2019ve paid \u00a317.50 a ticket to see two films I\u2019ve been anticipating for some time. OK \u00a317.50 sounds steep, but that was for iMAX 3D and I\u2019d still have paid more than \u00a310 for a \u2018normal\u2019 ticket.\nBut I left the cinema unfulfilled, because I felt like I\u2019d seen them both six months before.\nIn both cases the trailer revealed the entire structure of the story, key plot twists and expensive action sequences. Throw in a few character deaths for good measure and you\u2019ve got the basis of a significant chunk of what you\u2019ve paid your money for.\nI really did feel cheated by what the studio had wanted me to see in advance.\nSo is this just a modern trend? I checked out trailers for 1981\u2019s Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1964\u2019s Goldfinger to get a bigger picture.\nBoth revealed some well-known scenes (including Goldfinger\u2019s iconic laser and dialogue), but the plot basics were instead explained by voiceover, rather than any especially huge visual giveaways.\nBesides, the chance of actually seeing these trailers was significantly lessened due to the technology available at the time of release. Which got me thinking further.\n\u2018If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch it\u2019, I hear you cry. I wish it were that simple. In the age of the internet, exposure has increased tenfold.\nMarketing campaigns target social media and television, while the days of a simple poster are gone. Why commission a still image when you can display scenes from the film on a screen in a station or other public place?\nNot only that, but trailers are also forced upon you in the cinema itself before other films. Without a blindfold and a soundproof booth to hide in you have little choice.\nIt\u2019s not that I have a problem with marketing and ads. But they\u2019re spoiling the experience. I don\u2019t want to see all the best bits wrapped up into two minutes, six months ahead of release.\nHave you had a film spoiled by its trailer/marketing? Is Hollywood revealing too much in a desperate attempt to put bums on seats?\nDo ticket prices ruin your film-going experience?\nSomething George mentioned earlier about Terminator 2 trailer jogged my memory about another film from the same franchise, Terminator Genisys.\nTo promote the film, a trailer had been released that included a major plot twist ACTUALLY in the trailer. Now, I had heard about this trailer and had been purposely avoiding it. However, even when you try to avoid spoilers, sometimes it\u2019s out of your control. When I went to see Mad Max, they showed the afore-mentioned trailer and before I realised, it was too late. It cannot be unseen.\nEven the director, Alan Taylor, was unhappy about the spoilers in the trailer.\nGenisys was [spoiler alert] \u2026.. indeed half of the inspiration for this convo. I saw that article about Alan Taylor\u2019s thoughts the other day, but could only sympathise so much as the film was, in my opinion, a travesty.\nHave you seen the film now Ryan? If so what did you think of the big \u2018reveal\u2019? For a film that had very little else going for it that really did completely spoil the experience for me.\nI just can\u2019t understand why that decision was taken. You don\u2019t need to resort to something like that to generate interest \u2013 if said twist is that good then word of mouth will spread.\nFor anyone interested, the trailer for the new Bond film was released today.",

    "text": "Building a successful software platform is done by building software with a purpose by solving a problem that people already have. The problem may not be obvious, and it may not even be a problem that people are aware of, but the problem exists. Using Instagram as a case study, I think there are four keys a platforms success.\nMost people aren't professional photographers. They don't have access to the tools professional photographers use nor the time or money to buy the tools and learn them. But they do want professional looking photos. Instagram built a platform that had intrinsic value on it's own by providing people the ability to easily create professional looking photographs.\nOne of the keys that made Instagram successful was that they took something people were already doing and made it easier and better. They removed the need to download photos from a mobile device and then upload them from a desktop or laptop. They simplified the process and allowed users to share exiting photos right from their phones or take a new photo to share.\nThey also simplified an otherwise complex photo editing process by providing a set of templates that people could apply without having to understand image editing. This enabled a regular person to have professional looking photos without any work.\nOne thing that Instagram did very well is that it built it's software to work with exiting services like Facebook and Twitter. Services that already had a huge community of users. They didn't try to re-create Twitter or Facebook. Instead, they allowed Twitter and Facebook to get better by making their service interoperable.\nInstagram didn't force people to ONLY use their service. Instead, it allowed people to continue to use their existing social media services and augment a specific workflow to be better if they wanted to. Users don't want to be asked to chose between this OR that. They want to be able to use this AND that. Will your software provide additional choices or limit choices?",

    "text": "Grace. What is it? What does it mean? How do you get it and how do you KNOW you got it?\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I have no way of describing something I don\u2019t understand BUT believe deeply in my soul that it exists. How do you get these graces? Sanctifying grace is IN your soul. It\u2019s the free and underserved gift from God. Actual grace would come from our knowledge and belief of all things right and wrong \u2013 following the Ten Commandments, making sure we follow a path that is pure and justified. Justified means to be sinless, and to be sinless means you are in favor with God. When you are baptized you are sinless and therefore have favor with God. When you go to reconciliation, you are once again sinless and in favor with God. You are in a state of grace. Once sanctifying grace is in your soul, you can increase it by every good action you do \u2013 receiving Communion, saying prayers, performing corporal works of Mercy. The most important thing to think about is NOT what you are going to do or how you are going to do it but to recognize God\u2019s love. The reason you can do any good work is because God LOVES YOU FIRST in Grace. You must continually seek God\u2019s grace, continually respond to the actual graces God is working within you, inclining you to turn to Him and do good.\nHave I answered the question as to what Grace is? I\u2019ve read through all the study guides provided to me and compiled all the information, but I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve properly explained what Grace is.\nTo me Grace is a feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s butterflies in the stomach, and it takes my breath away. I feel this way every time I think of my husband. We met and married 38 years ago. I see God\u2019s grace in our meeting, getting married, and living our life together as husband and wife. Sometimes it\u2019s a jolt, like an electric shock and then an overwhelming wave of love, like the enormous amount of love I felt when I held my first baby in my arms for the first time. This happened again with my 2nd and 3rd child, and then God blessed us with twins to make 4 and 5. Then sometimes it feels like a raging fight going on inside me, making hard decisions that breaks my heart in two. I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray. Mostly it\u2019s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me \u201cGrandma\u201d. I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.\nWhere does Grace come from?",

Without a doubt she is the biggest public relation's splash ever in the transgender community. Now we have a former Olympic hero along with Navy Seal Kristin Beck as recent \"coming out\" stories. In fact, Kristin is running for US Congress.\nI am sure Jenner's life will ever allow her to ever experience the everyday lives we live as transgender women. Can you imagine the paparazzi crowding into a women's restroom with her?\nAfter watching her last show rater intently (and knowing it's a glossy over produced Kartrashian show) I couldn't see the emotion in Jenner. Again, I don't know all the facts about her, except she went out and bought the best plastic surgery money could buy. Again, maybe that's why I can't see any emotion in her face-she can't move it!!!!\nPlus, I have no idea how long she has been back on HRT. It took me three years on hormones to begin to see the world in a different way. When I watch Jenner, I wonder if she has passed over (no pun intended) to the feminine side much at all. She tries to overtalk most people and doesn't want to listen for the real problems-typical male.\nThen again, maybe I am just watching the true quandary of a Mtf gender transition play out with Jenner. I don't question the pure persistence and strength it takes to jump the gender fence. It will be interesting to see in the years to come what happens with Jenner. Will a \"softer-gentler\" Caitlin truly begin to enjoy a life in the girls sandbox? Or, will the ego trip of doing it still be more important?",

    "text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.",

    "text": "The Eastern Playoff race has been decided. The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.",

    "text": "Far Left Van Jones Admits that Trump Can Win and Gives Major Warning to Democrats - Video - Stumpin' For Trump!\nCNN contributor and former Obama aide Van Jones put out a warning to his fellow Democrats on Friday: Donald Trump is probably going to win the White House.\nIn the Facebook video, Jones credited Trump\u2019s ability to understand and use social media and reality television as well as his appeal to black voters as reasons he will likely win the White House in November.\nJones likened Trump to Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama in the sense that they all excelled in a new medium that no other politician could easily master.\n\u201cJust like FDR changed the rules of the game because he mastered radio, he was able to take radio and just completely master that \u2014 then you had JFK and JFK was able to master television \u2014 new medium, new master, new president,\u201d Jones said.\nHe continued to detail how Trump has been able to use his celebrity to appeal to parts of the Democratic base, especially black voters.\n\u201cIf only 70 percent don\u2019t like Donald Trump, that means 30 percent are open to his argument, if he gets half of those, he\u2019s president,\u201d Jones said.\nA Public Policy Polling report released on Monday showed Jones might be correct in his opinion that Trump is winning over large segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc. The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?",

    "text": "By Cecile Green and Rebecca Fisher-McGinty, republished and edited from Round Sky Solutions blog.\nEnlivening Edge Magazine has republished Part 2 of this article here.\nSo many of us have experienced bad meetings ranging from mildly frustrating to intolerable! In fact, bad meetings are so common, it\u2019s easy to assume they are an inevitable part of the status quo. If you have a small business, a nonprofit, board meetings, organizing meetings, a worker cooperative, or are interested in democratic or teal workplaces, you likely have to participate in meetings that drive you nuts for a variety of reasons. If so, you are in the right place, we wrote this post for you! In Part 1, we\u2019re going to focus on some of the things that come up during these meetings and then part 2, we\u2019ll share some solutions.\nPeople getting offended and defensive.\nPeople being accusatory and snide.\nPeople disengaging during the meetings and at all times.\nUpdates that go on forever and are not helpful.\nA few people that have too much responsibility.\nOnly a few people doing all the talking.\nWell intentioned people delivering inconsistent accountability.\nAgenda items that only reflect the needs of a few.\nAgenda items that take way too long and don\u2019t lead to meaningful outcomes that move things forward.\nMeetings with no clear ending that drag on for hours.\nSince bad meeting culture is so endemic it\u2019s easy to think that it\u2019s normal or unavoidable and I\u2019m here to tell you that while it may be normal, meaning that it happens all the time in all kinds of organizations, it\u2019s not healthy and it is entirely avoidable!\nSaps organizational energy and focus. There\u2019s nothing like an argument in the middle of a meeting for making everything worse.\nWastes time. Meetings are the most efficient way to sync up and align. When they are wasted with no clear decisions or next actions, people still have to obtain that information or risk doing bad or useless work. The work of obtaining that information outside of meetings represents a waste of time.\nSense of being stuck increases. It leaves people feeling powerless and frustrated leading to disengagement.\nUnderscores the sense of being overworked and underappreciated. When we don\u2019t have good mechanisms for redistributing work because we can\u2019t really see what other people are doing or not doing, it\u2019s easy for people to feel unseen and unappreciated for their work.\nMakes it harder to address important issues and get good work done. When meetings are wasted on conversations that go on way past any point of usefulness for the organization, the time we have to discuss and decide on important issues dwindles.\nGetting to facilitating effective, collaborative meetings can be challenging but is well worth the effort. Imagine what it might be like for you to have a organization full of inspiring leaders, with tools that enable you to hack your meetings into flows and effective outcomes? Well, for one thing, improving your meetings will save you time and energy and open up the space for everyone on the team to be more of their full selves, which simply feels better, and frankly gets better results.\nWith a generative meeting culture, here are a few things you can look forward to, including what some of our clients and students have shared about our work!\nEngaging and efficient collaboratively-led meetings. The power of joy and fulfillment that comes from productive efficient meetings goes on to infuse all of the work we do with that same motivating force, bringing much more meaning and productivity to everything that we do.\nWorking together productively with flow and satisfaction. Collaborating with others can be profoundly frustrating, and that frustration is a drain on both the organization and the individual. Getting to flow and satisfaction produces a host of benefits including longevity, in other words, people sticking around to contribute to an organization\u2019s success.\nNot getting stuck on issues. The feeling of being stuck in one\u2019s work with others is corrosive, especially if it\u2019s a consistent feature of meetings. Being able to move forward even on difficult issues is like opening the windows in a stale room and letting the light and air in.\nBetter innovation and problem solving. Working together is all about facing challenges and surmounting them with each other. Being equipped to do so efficiently, creatively, and innovatively is critical to organizational success in the complex and constantly changing business environments that we all find ourselves in today.\nMutual support & accountability. One of the biggest challenges of collaborative work environments where we are explicitly sharing power is accountability, both how we support each other in getting our work done, and how we hold each other accountable in the process.\nA real distribution of power and voice. This one is huge! If you really want to get innovating and feel some meaningful engagement from your team, try giving them real power.\nAnd the best part about learning all this is that you are going to be able to use these skills over and over again in all kinds of different contexts. It\u2019s like you\u2019ll have cracked the collaboration code and have super powers for enabling people to get along and do better work together.\nStay tuned for part 2 that will include 4 hacks and tangible tools to make your teal and democratically led meetings more effective and engaging.\nDo you resonate with the challenges of collaborative meetings? Who hasn\u2019t sat through a meeting that was poorly facilitated?? It can really put a damper on the work. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created this online training to support and train collaborative facilitators to really hone in on what\u2019s needed to get the work done in a collaborative and meaningfully inclusive way. And, meetings are such a big part of that.\nCome learn more about this online collaborative management training and the community of practice we\u2019re nurturing.\nSign up to explore leadership stories with others at the FREE community building introductory session on January 10th!\nEnlivening Edge is an affiliate partner of Round Sky Solutions.\nFeatured Image from Round Sky Solutions.",

    "text": "I found that more often than not, I wanted to put my development environment inside of Docker, not just my running code. My editor has plugins that help me browse documentation and check my syntax, but none of that works without installing additional stuff, and Docker has made me quite averse to installing anything on my host system.\nSo, I started stringing together Docker commands to do what I wanted, and I grew frustrated at all the copy/paste, and thought: There\u2019s gotta be a better way.\nIf you\u2019re interested in how it does this, see the nitty gritty details.\nGo to the releases page.\nMake sure it\u2019s executable and in your path.\n--type go - select the default version (1.6) of the pre-configured Go image.\n--type python --version 2.7 - select the 2.7 version of the pre-configure Python image.\nCurrently, go, clojure, and python are baked in. More will come.\ncreate - Creates an environment.\nconnect - Connect to an environment.\ndestroy - Destroys an environment and its home directory.\nrebuild - Rebuilds an environment, preserving the environment\u2019s home directory.\nrun - Creates an environment and immediately connects to it.\nstart - Starts an environment.\nstop - Stops an environment.\ninspect - Shows details about an environment as a JSON dump.\nlist - Lists existing environments.\nimages - Lists base images or user specific images.\nEnsure that the skegio/python:3.5 image is pulled.\nEnsure that the skeg ssh key is present. If not, one is generated.\nBuild an image based on skegio/python:3.5 which includes a user matching the host user.\nStart a container running sshd that mounts ~/skegs/myapp in as the user\u2019s home directory and the current directory in as a subdirectory.\nDo I have to use one of the pre-configured images?\nNot at all. You can create your own image and use it by specifying the -i flag to skeg create or skeg run. For now, your image needs to be based on skegio/base (like nate/aws), but that will change as skeg gets more sophisticated.\nWhy does skeg run the container as a long running process and connect over SSH rather than only for the lifetime of a process?\nDevelopment environments live longer than a single process, and they often involve many processes. Juggling these processes within an SSH session is a well understood problem with great solutions (like tmux), so for familiarity skeg takes the same approach.\nAlso, there are many times where additional software needs to be installed and daemons run to try something out. A long running container is perfect for these situations. Skeg offers a rebuild command, which will destroy and create the docker container with the same environment home directory, making it easy to reset back to a known state.",

    "text": "Anyone who has done a quick search on what to see in Norway certainly came across Preikestolen. It is one of the most popular hikes in the whole country. Not everyone experiences it the same way, however. Outdoor Life Norway is a guided service that offers guests a chance to see Pulpit Rock like most will never experience. The sunrise hike is an amazing way to up your chances of getting those stunning views without the crowds. If you truly want an original experience, though, go with their \"Off the beaten track\" tour. This hike begins with canoeing across a glacial lake to a long forgotten trail. Traverse the trail through multiple altitudinal zones and scramble up to the top of the fjord. There you can hike along until you reach your destination, a beautiful view of Preikestolen! There you can enjoy your view that majority of the hikers are missing. From there you will travel down to Pulpit Rock itself for some more photos. The trip down follows the more popular marked trail. If you are lucky enough, you may run into some of the Sherpas that have built the trails! If you're looking for more tours to fill up time in Norway, Outdoor Life Norway offers many guided services year round.\nThe land of fire and ice is an outdoor enthusiasts playground. Scuba diving in Silfra had been on my bucket list for years. It was a massive influence for me to get my PADI Open Water certification. Once I got my certification I remember my instructor asking me where I would go now that I could explore underwater paradises. I excitedly announced I'd be going to Iceland. He did not seem amused. \"Don't you want to start somewhere... warmer?\" I brushed off his remark as quickly as I whisked off my hood and booties. I had my mind made up. Silfra was my white whale and I finally had it in my headlights. When everything was booked, I was struck with panic. For years I had dreamed of Silfra, a place where you could swim between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. Would it be as spectacular as I had made it out to be?? Oh yes it was. The crystal clear glacial water is nearly ice cold and is filtered through lava creating over 300ft of visability. This quality of water means you can sip it while you're diving. It doesn't get fresher than that. Being able to say i've touched both continental plates at the same time in the only place in the world where you can dive directly in continental plate cracks is certainly bragging rights. I thought that would be the highlight of my cold swim in Silfra, but once I was in the water I forgot about the location. The dive was beyone beautiful with such distinct geographical features. The colors were jaw dropping. Though the dive itself was short, it's a dive that I could do over and over again. For those not scuba certified, many tour companies offer snorkeling excursions as well. Dive. Is. offers guests either option with photo services.\nIf you asked a stranger what came to mind when they thought of Iceland, volcanoes would make the list. This is definitely merited. The land has practically been completely molded by volcanic eruptions. If there's volcanoes you know there is lava, but Icelanders don't let it get them down. In fact, it gets them going. These hardened lava fields create the perfect backdrop for some serious mountain biking. These trails are not for the faint of heart. I may have overestimated my skills since I had been mountain biking in the past. I rated myself as an intermediate, which I quickly second guessed as soon as I saw people pull out their own peddles from perfectly packed Camelbaks. As nonchalantly as I could muster, I asked what the tour company's general client level was. My growing suspicion was confirmed. Most were season mountain bikers. I laughed in response to hide my surmounting fear. There was a good chance I may die in Iceland on a bicycle, I thought. There was worse ways to go I reasoned. It would make an interesting story, at least. Alas, I survived. Every part of my body may have hurt the next day, but something else was genuine as well. That was my smile. I signed up for a tour that I was not physically prepared for, but I did not regret it. It was a challenge that I overcame and I saw some stunning scenery along the way.\nFor those of you like me who are not expert mountain bikers, there are more appropriate tours to take. Icebike offers guests several options for different levels of experience. After seeing my lack of finesse in the lava fields, Icebike offered to take me to another location afterwards. I battled with my opposing feelings. Should I stick it out and do another lava field or should I opt for something different? The guide was very patient and genuinely wanted me to enjoy the experience that was right for me. I went with their recommendation. A part of me felt like a quitter until I saw the change of scenery. The lava fields were wild and otherworldly. The new scenery was as lush as if I had been plopped into Neverland itself. My bitter feelings instantly faded. Biking through the purple lupine fields was a magical end to a demanding day. My lesson of the day: Don't be afraid to try new things and have flexibility if they do not work out as perfectly as planned. My biking experience had more hiccups than I had predicted, but biking in Iceland was a once in a lifetime experience.\nUtah snow is world famous. In a location with pristine snow and more resorts than one can choose from, how does one... well, choose?? I struggled with the dilemma during a recent visit. I was down to my last day and I had only seen two resorts. I wanted to end with a bang without draining my bank account on a lift ticket. I gave up and resorted to asking my local friend for direction. \"You need to go to Sundance\". Sundance? I was baffled. This resort had barely made my radar. While I had pondered the pyramid hierarchy of ski resort awesomeness for days, it took my friend no time at all to respond to me.\"Not Snowbird or Park City?\" I bantered. Nope, he was firm. Well that settled my predicament. At the very least it would bring me some mental clarity since I no longer had to wrestle the decision.\nIf you go to Utah and don't visit Sundance Resort, you are doing it wrong. I immediately felt at home at this resort, as if I had been snowboarding there since I learned the difference between regular and goofy. In a world obsessed with modernizing everything, Sundance has made a point of preserving that nostalgic ski culture that we all love and miss. Okay, so the staff is nice. Is that a good enough reason to opt for Sundance over a larger resort? In retrospect, Sundance is one of the smaller resorts, but the views are not. I almost fell off the chairlift gawking at the scenery. From the base to the peak, every corner of the resort offered views that even Ansel Adams would have to stop and photograph. The character didn't stop at the lodge. The terrain kept me smiling from trail to trail. Feeling hungry? Stop at the peak for the most scenic nachos in the game. The Bearclaw Cabin is the only mountaintop lodge in Utah. If the sun is out, opt to sit outside in one of the zero gravity chairs. Sun and snow, can you beat it? If you want a resort with big hearts, big views, and a touch of home, you need to go to Sundance Resort.\nThe sunshine state usually cultivates images of lazy beach towns with a weird abundance of shaggy-haired surfers with names like \"Zander\" or \"Brock\". If you don't think of surfing, chances are you think of a retirement home paradise with every pm dinner special you could imagine. I am not here to knock your idea of Florida, because both scenes I just described exist in North Florida. I mean what's wrong with eating your food truck burrito while your barefoot at a reasonable time so hard to get on board with? You have time for dessert and digestion before you catch those zzz's! This is a battle meant for another day. If you aren't into shredding the gnar or attending senior bingo, you may wonder what Florida has to offer other than concrete amusement parks. Rejoice my friends because I have a solution. Though it may not be topping your vacation brochures, Florida offers great places for paddle sports. These sports can be enjoyed by any age group. Are you a seasoned kayaker looking for a challenge? Opt to try paddle boarding instead for a great core workout that perfects your balancing skills. Are you more into the outdoors just to get a tan? Select a tandem kayak and make your buddy do the brunt of the work. I know this because I've been the recipient of this. As I paddled with all my might in Norway and wondered why we weren't going faster, my friend Randy sat behind me happily snapping photos enjoying the fruits of my labor. I did not learn my lesson, however, since here I am recommending his devious plan to all of you. Just make sure your friend takes the front seat and doesn't read this passage. You're welcome.\nThe Aloha state is paradise: sunny, laid-back, umbrella drinking mai-tai kind of paradise. Though many people come here to do nothing more than read their book on the island's 30 miles of beaches, Maui can also be an adventure hot spot. I mean literally. The highest peak on the island is the world's largest dormant volcano. The impressive Haleakala volcano never ceases to draw in outdoor enthusiasts from around the globe. Want to feel like Hawaiian royalty? Opt to catch a mesmerizing sunrise from it's peak. Haleakala National Park offers guests more than just the star of the show. The park offers beach access but my favorite swimming spot of the entire Maui trip was dunking into the Seven Sacred Pools, or the Pools of 'Ohe'o. If mermaids emerged from the depths, I would have thought it perfectly normal. I loved being able to climb up to a series of the falls and sit under the cool,flowing water as I looked out at the ocean. Some pools are more popular and accessible than others. As I mentioned, the pools flowed into the Pacific so that contrast in scenery was fantastic. Pack a picnic to make a great day of pool adventures. Swimming does not get more exotic than this. After you have your fill of swimming, continue hiking through Haleakala National Park to dry off. Your efforts will be rewarded when you reach a stunning bamboo forest. You may think you accidentally arrived on another continent with the landscape change.\nHaleakala is not to be missed and you can access it off of the famous Road to Hana. The road itself merits a few days to explore. Opt for a convertible so you can soak up as much roadside scenery as you can. If you are still craving big views, end your trip with a cherry on top. A helicopter tour of Maui may not be the most physical tour you can do, but I promise you will be feeling the adrenaline. The tour gives you access to views you would never be able to see otherwise. Get close to peaks and waterfalls alike. The views are breathtaking and you may just get the feeling that you are about to be dropped off in Jurassic Park.\nI can never be satisfied with doing everything just like everyone else. If I am going to a stereotypical tourist spot. I need to have an element that is different. While doing my research for antelope canyon, I found just what I was looking for to satisfy my stubborn self. Hidden Canyon Kayak was Arthur and the day trip through Antelope Canyon was my sword in the stone. At first I was a bit disappointed to see how large my group size was. In the past I have been spoiled with much smaller guide to tourist ratios in my travels. Once in the water, however, the problem dispersed as quickly as waves off my boat. The guides were good at accomodating people of all ability levels. As a frequent kayaker, I had a much faster pace than most. The guides recognized this, and made sure I did not feel restrained. Once we reached antelope canyon, we were released to explore the slot canyon on our own to a certain point. Again, I was happy to hear this since I much preferred being alone than attached to families I didn't know. It was a thrill to be able to skip, run, and even sing if I wanted to down these beautiful corridors. I loved this tour and would recommend it to anyone. The guides were relatable and I enjoyed my time talking to them. My only recommendation is if you are an experienced kayaker, let the guides know ahead of time and they will bring you a touring kayak. Compared to my kayak at home, the kayak I was given made me feel like I was moving through mud. Avoid this and request a more efficient boat. They just don't like to assign them to someone who is not experienced and has a higher chance to tip the narrow boats.\nHave you ever thought that mountain biking is cool, but it would be so much cooler to bike on Mars? I can't say i've been on this train of thought before, someone out there has been. To them I say, Mars is too far away. Sure you can keep fantasizing about the day that Richard Branson and Elon Musk unite like superheroes and create martian colonies complete with lotteries to fuel us basic humans with dreams of dual planet citizenship. Okay, maybe I have thought of this before. I digress. Biking in Page, Arizona may be the closest alternative. Really, the place is out of this world! So aren't my puns. Accessible right from town, I was told by a local to check out the Rimview trail. I stopped at a local shop, Lake Powell Paddleboards, and rented a mountain bike. A quick overview of a map and a heeding message of \"there are parts of the trail that if you get hurt or can't finish, no one can come get you\"and I was off. A little skeptical of my skill after my warning, I wasn't sure how my day would go. Quickly into the trail, my reservations disappeared. It was easy to with the beautiful desert landscape. The \"rimview\" gets its name for a very specific reason. In parts you were on the very edge of the trail with a steep drop off. If it got too hairy, I simply walked. It was my best option since I was alone and if I got hurt, I didn't want to think of the desolate potential situation. The views of Lake Powell were breathtaking. What blew me away was that I had the trail virtually to myself. In a busy tourist town, I came across only two people my whole time biking. The two people were locals at that. It was my escape from vacation. A step away to truly take in a place. This was not without hard work, however. The trail had its difficult moments and was best suited for at least intermediate riders. If you are new, you at least have the ability to walk any dangerous spots. The heat is also draining. A lot of water and snacks for energy are a must. I can honestly say my lunch was well earned this day.",

    "text": "Amber Lilyestrom, an amazing branding and business strategist, dreamed of being a stay at home mama well before having a child. At 8 months after her daughter was born, Amber took a leap of faith, quitting her job with only ONE CLIENT! Amber knew that focusing her time and energy on her business was the only way it would grow, and quitting her 9-5 turned out to be the best decision because it led her to her KILLER business. She is passionate about branding and business strategy and hosts her own podcast, and a two-day conference for women who want to take their life and career to the next level.\nWe were so inspired by her fierce work ethic, and wanted to create a website that reflected her passion. Amber wanted her site design to be bold, elegant, and CLEAR to visitors on exactly who she is. Amber had strong content and we loved getting to design a gorgeous website around it. Go Live did not design her main logo, but we designed the Ignite Your Soul logo (pictured above!) for an upcoming event and had so much fun with it. Here's a HUGE CONGRATS to Amber on the launch of her new website, and for turning her dream into a reality.\n\"My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\"\nAmber's story of courage and passion will inspire and encourage you in your own journey!\nAmber: I have always been fascinated with human behavior, psychology and really understanding why people do what they do. I have been equally obsessed with helping people breakthrough their fears and roadblocks to live a more fulfilling and joyful life. I grew up witnessing the people I love struggle and made it my goal early on to create a different way of life for myself so I could make a positive impact on the lives of others by showing them what I learned. What better way to take ownership of your life than to match your work with the sacred mission?\nAmber: I worked in collegiate athletics marketing for a decade and had the gift of contributing to the growth of a Division I athletics brand on a national scale. My career path there was incredibly entrepreneurial and I taught myself how to write sales copy, design websites and graphics and basically everything in between. I was also asked to teach at the university and mentor students throughout my career, both of these roles allowed me to hone and develop my craft as a coach.\nAmber: The answers do not live out there, they come from within. I've spent thousands of dollars on coaches and programs and live events only to be guided on back to my own truth. I do not regret one penny spent or mile walked on this path, though, as it has helped me to become even better at what I do and more committed to the bigger mission of my life.\nAmber: The funny thing about this question is that so many people DID tell me that \"Everything I need is already within me.\" But, I didn't listen because I had to go on my own quest to find my way home to myself. I am so grateful for all of the people who patiently and lovingly stood by me on this journey, I am certain I will need them to continue to remind me of this message, once again, down the path.\nGO LIVE: WHAT WAS THE MOMENT YOU HAD WHEN YOU SAID \"I SHOULD DO THIS\" OR WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE LEAP INTO WORKING FOR YOURSELF?\nAmber: I had known that I wanted to be a work from home mama well before I was pregnant, only I didn't know HOW it was going to happen. After my own near-death experience (aka wakeup call) during our daughter's birth, I knew that it was time to get serious about making this dream come true. I launched my business 8 months after she was born and quit my job with just one client on the books (crazy!?), but I knew that if I could welcome in one client, more would come and focusing my time/energy on my business was the only way to help it grow. Four years later, I am so grateful for that courageous former version of me.\nGO LIVE: WHAT THINGS HAVE YOU GAINED, OR DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN, IN YOUR LIFE FROM FOLLOWING THIS DREAM?\nAmber: I have my life, my health, my husband (we retired him from his police career in 2017), the memories with our daughter that I haven't had to miss a minute of, sacred friendships with people I would have never met, time with the people I love the most and a deep sense of fulfillment and personal growth that comes with it. My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\nAmber: I absolutely love your design work and the way you approach supporting visionaries like me in sharing our message and mission with the world. I so appreciate how you tend to the finite details while honoring the big vision and delivering a finished product that will make a massive impact. Our websites create a powerful experience for our future clients to feel fully witnessed as they take the next step on their journey. I am so thrilled with what we've created together.",

    "text": "Not feeling well today, so back in bed at eleven in the morning. Sore throat. Sinus pressure. Yuck.\nI will say, though, it's nice to be alone up here in my room in the middle of the day with some items I have come to count as dearest companions - my Bible, journal, daily devotion book, thankful journal, and a collection of gel pens.\nCurrently, I am reading Jesus Calling, by Sarah Young. Filled with lovely little reminders of God's presence and His love for me, this daily devotional helps focus my thoughts either to start my day right or rest peacefully during the night.\nAlso by my side today is God's Wisdom for a Mother's Heart, by Bobbie Wolgemuth. This has provided hours and hours of conversation starters for the bi-monthly mentoring group I help lead at my church. Though only 128 pages in length, we have used this book for more than a year. The girls in Moms to Moms meet the first and second Wednesday nights of the month, a sort of round-table, open forum where no topic is off limits, but mostly parenting and reassuring that they're going to make it. We study the Word, pray, laugh, cry, teach each other, and we are all growing.\nMy co-leaders and I agree these young ladies with their children around them are our heroes. Represented are single and married moms, working outside and inside their homes, public/private/homeschooling moms...you name it, we've got it. This is one group we hate to miss. A gift from God. Truly.\nMy thankful journal is simply a little leather-bound book where I record the gifts God has given me. Eucharisto. Thanks. One Thousand Gifts. 10,000 reasons. Why write them down? Because I dare not forget the goodness of God. In the remembering and the acknowledging I am overwhelmed with reassurance that God is my provider, comforter, healer, friend, joy, strength, and so much more. I am much less likely to lose my focus and wander if I am remembering God's deeds and giving thanks.\nLast, but certainly not least, is my personal journal. It may as well be my heart on paper. This is where it all comes pouring forth to be sorted, processed, saved or discarded. You know, keep the good and throw out the chaff. That's what the journal is for - it is fearsome, yet necessary. Necessary for me anyways.\nThere are a few more books I could talk about. Don't know about you, but I read several at once. These I mentioned were simply the lucky ones to be carried into the sick bed with me today.\nDo you have reading materials you count as \"dearest companions\"? What are they and why are they special to you?\nI also have the Jesus Calling devotional, Karen had mentioned it a long time ago, and I finally got it. I've really enjoyed it, it's definitely helped me focus in on that 'personal' time..",

    "text": "Mark Frigon is a senior product manager with IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization, a key group involved in leading IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce initiative. Mark\u2019s specialties are in Web analytics (he joined IBM as part of its acquisition of Coremetrics) and Internet privacy, an issue that has come to the forefront in recent years for digital marketers around the globe.\nEffective Web metrics are critical to the success of businesses looking to succeed in e-commerce and digital marketing these days, and IBM has a number of experts who spend a lot of their time in this area.\nOne of those here in Madrid at the IBM Smarter Commerce Global Summit, Mark Frigon, is a senior product manager for Web analytics in IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization.\nMark sat down with me to discuss the changing nature of Web analytics, and how dramatically it has evolved as a discipline over the past few years, including the increased focus by marketers on \u201cattribution,\u201d the ability to directly correlate a Web marketing action and the desired result.\nMark also spoke at the event about the importance for digital marketers around the globe to be more privacy-aware, a topic we also discussed in our time together, calling out in particular the \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d industry self-regulatory effort that intends to put privacy controls in the hands of consumers.\nIf you spend any time thinking about Internet privacy or Web analytics, or both, this is a conversation you won\u2019t want to miss.\nRemember that team of blackjack-playing cohorts from MIT in the book (and, later, movie) \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d who fleeced a number of Vegas casinos before they were invited never to grace their gambling doors again?\nIBM\u2019s Yuchun Lee explains to the IBM Smarter Commerce audience in Madrid how the company is doubling down on its investments in enterprise and social marketing management.\nWell, IBM executive and Unica co-founder Yuchung Lee was one of those who was asked not to come back. Permanently.\nWhich is okay by those of us at IBM, as we\u2019re keeping him way too busy to bother with card counting.\nInstead, Lee\u2019s mathematical prowess is being applied to help companies improve their marketing capabilities, a key ingredient in the IBM Smarter Commerce soup.\nAs Lee explained in his keynote session this afternoon here in Madrid, \u201cthis is the first time we\u2019re bringing together Coremetrics and Unica.\u201d He also highlighted the fact that out of the 1,700 participants here at the Summit, over 1,000 are marketeers!\nLee provided a broad overview of the Enterprise Marketing Management portfolio at IBM, explaining that \u201cwe\u2019ve shared progress as a group within IBM over the past year,\u201d sharing that also incorporates lessons learned from both the market and IBM customers.\nThe social buildout also incorporates enterprise analytics, tag management, and full mobile and social market capabilities that tie more closely together the marketing automation experience with the social realm.\nLee also debriefed quickly on two recent acquisitions, DemandTec, which expands IBM\u2019s EMM offerings with pricing, promotion, and product mix optimization, and Tealeaf, which rounds out IBM EMM solutions with customer experience management and analytics.\nAs Lee explained, \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what TeaLeaf provides, the ability to look at snapshots of individual user sessions to help determine where, exactly, it is that you\u2019re driving them crazy with your convoluted web experience!\nBut where Lee really \u201chooked\u201d the audience was in his observations about the Generation C customer, who is more connected and in control than ever! Did you know that 4 in 10 smartphone users search for an item in a store? Or that 77 percent of B2B buyers check with their peers before buying?\nWhich, he expanded, means that it must work more closely with other disciplines and functions, including merchandising, on- and offline sales, customer service, and even with IT.\nBut, Lee indicated, they can\u2019t stop there. Marketing must also share customer insights with other parts of the business so that all functions can benefit from these insights.\nFinally, they must extend that sharing of customer insights with other key stakeholders who can benefit: Partners, agencies, customer communities, and so forth.\nLee also explained that many organizations must adjust their marketing cultures to fully capitalize on the \u201cGeneration C\u201d (\u201cC\u201d for \u201cconnected\u201d) culture. They must build organizations that balance analytics and creative talents (easier said than done!), work with IT rather than around IT, and break down marketing siloes \u2014 digital and traditional marketing must consolidate and collaborate.\nFinally, accept mistakes and learn from them, and be agile enough to iterate and improve upon them. As even Lee can explain, there are only so many opportunities to double down in blackjack, and in business.\nThe enterprise marketing management opportunity vis-a-vis IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce strategy is one of those rare opportunities.\nWell, that day of the year has finally arrived.\nThat day where we all slink into our offices after four nice, long, official holidays where (mostly, we hope) people stay away from their computers and mobile phones and tablets and God knows whatever other else connected devices just long enough to make it feel like you got some real rest (even though many of you were probably dealing with unrelated, but similarly frustrating, realities \u2014you know, like screaming kids and antagonizing in-laws).\nAnd all you could do was think about how nice it would be to come back into the nice peaceful and quiet office on Monday so you could get back to\u2026shopping.\nYes, boys and girls, cyber Monday has arrived.\nBut judging from the results of the IBM Coremetrics Benchmark Black Friday e-retailing analysis, you really need not worry about coming into the office anymore just so you can get yourself an extra slurp of broadband.\nThis is 2011, yo, all you gotta do is break out that iPad and you\u2019ll be standing in front of Macys women\u2019s wear or Best Buy\u2019s electronics section in seconds!\nBut while you\u2019re out there figuring out your Cyber Monday strategy, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights reel for the weekend in e-shopping.\nU.S shoppers apparently took great advantage of early sales this holiday, driving a 39.3 percent year-over-year increase in online Thanksgiving day spending while setting the stage for 24.3 percent online growth on Black Friday compared to the same period last year.\nConsumer spending increases. The aggressive shopping we witnessed on Thanksgiving Day this year carried over into Black Friday, with online sales increasing 24.3 percent annually.\nMobile Bargain Hunting. Black Friday also saw the arrival of the mobile deal seeker who embraced their devices as a research tool for both in-store and online bargains. Mobile traffic increased to 14.3 percent (compared to 5.6 percent last year).\nMobile Sales On the Getgo. Sales on mobile devices surged to 9.8 percent (a tripling from last year\u2019s 3.2 percent).\nApple\u2019s One Stop Shop. Mobile shopping was led by Apple, with the iPhone and iPad ranking one and two for consumers shopping on mobile devices (5.4 percent and 4.8 percent respectively). Together, the iPhone and iPad accounted for 10.2 percent of all online retail. Apparently, it ain\u2019t easy bein\u2019 an Android on Black Friday.\nThe iPad Factor. Shoppers using the iPad led to more retail purchases more often per visit than other mobile devices, leading one to wonder about the real estate to deal closing ratio. The bigger the device, the larger the average order value? Possibly, but this number can\u2019t lie: Conversion rates for the iPad were 4.6 percent, compared to 2.8 for all other mobile devices. The iPad was this weekend\u2019s e-shopping mobile king.\nSocial Influence. Shoppers referred from Social Networks generated 0.53 percent of all online sales on Black Friday, with Facebook leading the pack and accounting for a full 75 percent of all social network traffic.\nSocial Media Chit Chat. Boosted by a 110 percent increase in discussion volume compared to 2010, top discussion topics on social media sites immediately before Friday showed a focus on the part of consumers to share tips on how to avoid the rush. Topics included out-of-stock concerns, waiting times and parking, and a spike in positive sentiment around Cyber Monday sales.\nSurgical Shopping Goes Mobile: Mobile shoppers demonstrated a laser focus that surpassed that of other online shoppers with a 41.3 percent bounce rate on mobile devices versus online shopping rates of 33.1 percent.\nThis data came from findings of the IBM Coremetrics fourth annual Black Friday Benchmark, which tracks more than a million transactions a day, analyzing terabytes of raw data from 500 retailers nationwide.\nWith this data, IBM helps retailers better understand and respond to their customers \u2014 across the organization \u2014 improving sourcing, inventory management, marketing, sales, and services programs.\nYou can get more background on the study here.\nBlack Friday: U.S. Online Retail Up 20% Year-Over-Year!\nI had absolutely nothing to do with shopping today, online or off. But I seemed to have been a minority, and for those retailers looking to the holiday season to help bolster an otherwise anemic year, they will be excited by the news delivered today by the IBM Coremetrics e-retailing Black Friday Benchmark Report.\nNo flies on those guys! Apparently they were too busy counting everyone else\u2019s clicks to pursue any of their own.\nClick image to enlarge. Black Friday e-retail sales in U.S. were up 20% over the same period last year, with consumers turning to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for their e-shopping efforts more than they ever have.\nE-retail sales at major online retailers were up 20 percent as of 3 P.M. EST this afternoon, compared to the same time on the Friday after Thanksgiving last year.\nThe survey monitors some 500 major U.S. Online retailers, and the 20 percent is in line with the 20 percent year-over-year increase IBM was reporting mid-day yesterday. However, apparently lots of folks are holding out until they\u2019ve allowed the turkey trytophan to kick in and the evening football games to start, because full-day online Thanksgiving sales ended 39 percent up over the holiday last year and they soared Thursday evening.\nMobile devices also played a much bigger role in online shopping this year, according to the benchmark. Shoppers are making 9.73 percent of their purchases from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, about the same as Thanksgiving day. And, as much as 17.37 percent of traffic to e-retail sites is coming from mobile devices, higher than even the 15.2 recorded yesterday.\nConsumer spending increased: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9 percent, with consumers pushing the average order value up from $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent.\nLuxury goods are making a comeback. Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6 percent increase in sales.\nSocial shopping. Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their favorite brands\u2019 social presence, and are turning to their social networking friends for information about deals and inventory levels.\nThough the percentage of visitors arriving from social sites is fairly small relative to all online visitors \u2014 nearly 1 percent \u2014 it\u2019s gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space.\nDepartment stores. They\u2019ve become the research engine of choice for consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over year on department store sites.\nHealth and Beauty. A reported rise of 73.1 percent in the number of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a 53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed an order.\nIn-Store Sales for Consumer Electronics and Appliances. These are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to an analytics-based forecast from IBM\u2019s Global Business Services division.\nU.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, which has led to strong pent-up demand for consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in today\u2019s economy.\nStay tuned here on the Turbo blog for other upcoming reports on the holiday season\u2019s retail tidings. It\u2019s still Black Friday, we still have the weekend, and Cyber Monday is a full three days away!\nThe weekend in sports proved to be as about as exciting as I had hoped.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Darren Clarke became the third man from that region to win a golf major in 3 of the last 6, and it was Clarke\u2019s first British Open title.\nAnd as to the U.S. Women\u2019s soccer team, they played a nailbiter of a match, but in the end the team from Japan won on penalty kicks.\nMy hat goes off to both teams. I had a whole living room full of soccer fans, and we were all nervous wrecks up to that last penalty kick that gave Japan this year\u2019s World Cup trophy.\nStill, it was an awesome game all the way around, and I wish my friends in Japan a very happy celebration.

    "text": "I figured if I could do it at all, I needed the help of the big guns. My 400mm f/2.8 lens would have worked nicely, it would allow me to zoom into the moon to fill the frame and still let plenty of light in to give me the best chance of a capture. I ran into two problems. First off, doubled \u2013 the 400mm 2.8 lens goes to 800mm f/5.6. Then, the more zoomed in you are, the more the movement of the subject in the frame. I had settled on a 1.4x extender which would get me close to 600mm with just a one stop penalty to put me at f/4.\nNext was the camera. I have a Canon Rebel 35mm film SLR that I bought on eBay for $1. It had controller issues, but thankfully the camera just so happened to work set to manual. I gave the inside a coat of urethane, set up some glass guides to hold a plate and shot it. 600mm, f/4 \u2013 ten seconds. And that\u2019s the plate you see to the right.\nFast forward ten or so months I just so happen to be interested in seeing what I can achieve with the setup again. My converted SLR has since gone missing in the attic and I really didn\u2019t want to permanently convert one of my many other 35mm film SLR cameras to wet plate. So for a few minutes I looked at the back of the camera and came up with a game plan on a plate holder that turned a 35mm camera into a wet plate camera.. And the best thing was that it was reversible. That is, if you\u2019re careful to not drip corrosive silver nitrate into the body.\nBecause the material is just a millimeter and a half thick I decided to hollow the center with no corners and then just stick corners on myself with a good metal to plastic glue. The corners themselves are cut pieces of trophy plate.\nOnce the glue was dried the holder gives a nice snug fit in the film compartment of the Canon Rebel 35mm body! I hope to get to making some images soon with it!",

    "text": "Thanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Lesbia makes her career dream a reality!\nWhen Lesbia was very young, her parents made a difficult decision. They wanted a better future for their family, so they moved from Central America to the U.S. to find it.\nDuring that period, her parents were back and forth between the countries, and Lesbia rarely saw them. Six years later, she finally joined them on American soil.\nWhen she started school, Lesbia couldn\u2019t speak English. Other kids made fun of her name. She struggled.\nBut eventually, she learned to stop caring what other people thought. She realized that this new country held a wealth of opportunities.\nAs time went on and they worked to adjust to the U.S., other members of Lesbia\u2019s family found Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF). They referred her, and after obtaining a work permit, she was able to get temporary child care assistance at HUF.\nHUF changed Lesbia\u2019s life. She was supported by multiple HUF programs, including Income Support, Financial Literacy, and the Bridge Program, where she completed the Customer Service and Sales Training, as well as the Patient Care Technician EKG/Phlebotomy Training. She\u2019s currently finishing a class in math at Sheridan Technical School, and has a bright future.\nThanks to HUF, Lesbia\u2019s family will no longer live paycheck to paycheck, and she, her husband, and her children will live better lives.\nThe Bridge Program at Hispanic Unity opens up a world of opportunities! With the generous support of @Citi Foundation and the Community #ProgressMakers grant, program participants have access to tuition assistance for career pathways in high demand fields, including national certifications in Patient Care Technician (PCT) and Customer Service and Sales Training (CSST).\nThanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Marisol makes her dream a reality!\nFrom Boston, to Puerto Rico, to Miami, Marisol has been following her American dream since birth.\nBorn in Boston, she spent several years in the historic city before her family relocated to Puerto Rico, where she grew up and attended school.\nAs an adult, Marisol made the difficult decision to move to Florida in search of a better future for her family. She sought more safety and security. Marisol was excited and deeply committed to grow and thrive in her new home!\nStarting fresh presented numerous challenges, however. She struggled to find work while caring for her two beloved children.\nLuckily, Marisol found Hispanic Unity of Florida. Her brother had participated in HUF\u2019s Center for Working Families program and referred her.\nMarisol took the many opportunities offered by HUF and ran with them. She received income support through gift cards, child care assistance, hurricane relief help, and affordable housing. She also entered the Bridge Program where she became certified through HUF\u2019s Customer Service and Sales Representative (CSR) training.\nShortly thereafter, she was able to secure part-time employment. Marisol says that the training helped her be more in touch with clients and better understand their needs.\nThe hard-working mother wanted to take things further and thrive in a new career, so she completed HUF\u2019s Patient Care Technician Program (PCT) at Sheridan Technical College \u2013 a highly specialized training with a focus on EKG and Phlebotomy.\nCountless new opportunities are now available to Marisol, and she plans to move on into the Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) Program. Eventually, she\u2019ll work in a private practice, and she credits HUF for helping her to empower herself and help ensure her family\u2019s successful future.\nThe Urban Institute recently released a research report titled Upskilling the Immigrant Workforce to Meet Employer Demand for Skilled Workers.\nThe report takes a look at the whole US but supplements its findings through site visits and interviews with a variety of stakeholders in three metro areas, Seattle, Dallas and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.\nHispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) participated in the study and shared with the researchers our own insights into the work we do assisting immigrants who are both unemployed as well as, underemployed.\nHow many of us know that Broward County\u2019s percentage of foreign-born residents is nearly 33% \u2013 or 3 out every 10 residents?\nThe implications are significant for our community. Our immigrant population is mostly first generation. And the needs of this population are different then communities where the immigrants are second or third generation or where the immigrants are English literate and highly educated.\nLocal communities with large foreign born residents must invest in foundational resources to assist these immigrants in their integration \u2013 which in turn \u2013 benefits the whole community.\nAt HUF where we serve immigrants from 30 different nations, our work is focused on English language instruction, education (for both parents and children), economic development (employment, small business creation, asset building, health and child care supports) and civic engagement.\nThis from the research report: This diversity within the immigrant workforce\u2014with high numbers at both ends of the educational spectrum\u2014is important context for our focus in this report on opportunities for immigrants employed in lower- and middle-skilled jobs.\nAt HUF, we simultaneously work with former professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc. as well as individuals who never completed high school. This diversity within the immigrant community requires different approaches to the work community organizations such as HUF undertakes. For us, it means providing core services that are fundamental to all clients while providing \u201cadd-ons\u201d such as information on how to have educational credentials certified for immigrants with college or advanced degrees.\n\u201cOne out of every six workers in the US are immigrants.\u201d The research report\u2019s conclusions offers guidance for all our community\u2019s stakeholders: state and local policy makers, workforce development service providers, funders and employers. Woven throughout the report are the community based organizations that are often at the frontlines of the work with immigrants.\nSouth Florida is at full employment. Now is the time to support and address the needs of our whole community including communities of color and the immigrant community.\nThis article was originally published on June 6, 2018 on the UnidosUS website.\nAs of this posting, Florida is the only state in the nation to not have a federally approved accountability plan.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) submitted its revised Florida Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Plan to the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE).\nHispanic Unity of Florida is a member of a coalition of civil rights organizations that earlier this year during Florida\u2019s Legislative Session, proposed legislation that would align Florida\u2019s school accountability system with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the largest federal law governing K-12 education. Florida\u2019s current system neglects to factor into its school grades the test scores of many English learner (EL) and Latino students, and fails to use a native language assessment when appropriate for the 10% of Florida\u2019s K-12 students who are learning English.\nEffective implementation of ESSA at the state and district level is key to ensuring that educators and ELs have the data and tools they need to become English proficient and academically successful as swiftly as possible.\nUnder ESSA, in exchange for federal funds, states must track and report the performance of subgroups of students\u2014racial and ethnic minorities, those from low-income families, ELs, and those with disabilities\u2014when assessing school performance.\nFlorida\u2019s revised ESSA plan, however, sidesteps the intent of the federal law by bundling together the lowest-performing students regardless of subgroup. That means schools that are not meeting the needs of every subgroup can still get a passing grade, and parents are not aware.\nThe revised Florida plan creates the new \u201cFederal Percent of Points Earned Index\u201d (FPPEI) of which subgroup performance and an English Language Proficiency Indicator will be components. The fact that Florida created the FPPEI is a good sign that the state recognizes its obligation to align the state\u2019s system with federal law. The FPPEI, a new section of a Florida school\u2019s report card, in effect creates a parallel accountability system. The calculation of a school\u2019s grade still does not take into account subgroup performance and English language proficiency. This decision is problematic, confusing and unnecessary.\nWhat\u2019s more, while the federal government urges states, when appropriate, to test students in their native language to better assess what they know\u2014Florida chose not to meet this requirement, despite being home to one of the nation\u2019s largest EL population.\nA recent report by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) study highlights that Florida educates the third-largest K\u201312 EL population in the nation. ELs make up 10% of Florida\u2019s student population; nearly 290,000 students. The majority of ELs\u201475%\u2014in the state speak Spanish. According to recent Florida state assessment results, double-digit gaps exist in graduation rates and academic achievement between ELs and their non\u2013EL peers.\nAs a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, it is estimated that Florida is now home to between 10,000 to 12,000 Puerto Rican students. While these students are American citizens, they also are predominately ELs.\nFor more information about ESSA and education issues impacting the Latino community, visit unidosus.org and UnidosUS\u2019s education-focused website, Progress Report: Ensuring the Success of All Students.\nHave conversations about ESSA with parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, candidates and state elected officials. Bring up the \u201cAdvocate Questions\u201d in the conversation.\nEngage parents and other stakeholders in your area by hosting an ESSA meeting at your school or a community-based organization.\nFollow and Vote: Follow what local and statewide candidates have to say about education. Vote for candidates in the Primary Election on August 28, 2018, and the General Election, November 6, 2018 who are committed to all K-12 students. As voters we can and must make education a top campaign issue this election cycle!\nLearn more: LULAC Florida will host an Organizational Roundtable and Community Forum on June 15, 2018 in Miami, at the Dadeland Marriott at 5:30 p.m.\nTo learn more about why activists are urging Secretary DeVos to reject Florida\u2019s ESSA Plan, read this Education Week article.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program offers free weekly citizenship classes, assistance with the naturalization interview and application, and financial coaching.

For general information or registration, please visit: http://www.HUFcitizen.org or contact: (305) 562-1796.\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows that more than 88,000 people obtained legal permanent resident (LPR) status in South Florida in 2016. That makes our region, the third highest ranking in the country for people obtaining LPR status, following New York City and Los Angeles.\nIn the last decade, HUF has empowered more than 12,000 aspiring citizens from more than 30 countries to achieve their goal of U.S. citizenship. In 2017, more than 5,000 eligible students attended classes at HUF and at partnering Broward and Miami-Dade libraries, and more than 30 trained volunteers contributed more than 2,300 hours as instructors last year.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program led by the Office of New Americans (ONA) of Miami-Dade County and Hispanic Unity of Florida, Inc. is a county-wide initiative made possible with the support from our Corporate Founding Partner Citi Community Development and the generosity of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation. Partners in Miami-Dade County include: Miami-Dade Public Library System and the City of North Miami Beach and their North Miami Beach Library. Media partners include Univision 23, UniMas 69, Amor 107.5, Mix 98.3, WQBA and Radio Mambi.\nThe Citi Foundation today announced that Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) was selected as the recipient of a $500,000 grant as part of the 2018 Community Progress Makers Fund.\nThe Fund is a $20 million, two-year initiative by the Citi Foundation to support high-impact community organizations that are driving economic opportunities in our communities, by bringing together residents, nonprofits, businesses, and municipal agencies.\nHUF joins a group of 40 change agents (five in south Florida) that are playing a key role in coordinating the efforts of multiple partners toward common goals and working in new ways to address urban challenges in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami/South Florida, New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington D.C.\nThrough the fund, HUF will have the opportunity to offer low- and moderate-income families with access to customized vocational training programs, credentials and career pathways for middle-skill jobs in high demand.\nby commenting on this blog and on our Facebook post.\nWe are pleased to announce our new Board officers, as well as the full slate of Board members for 2018.\nCharles Tatelbaum, a Director with the Ft. Lauderdale law firm of Tripp Scott, P.A., has been elected to serve as Chair of the HUF Board of Directors.

    "text": "Why Many Businesses Choose to Incorporate in Nevada.\nNevada is a very attractive option for businesses choosing to incorporate. Here are a list of the top reasons to consider it even if your business is not based in Nevada.\nNevada Protects the Corporate Veil.\nNevada offers it\u2019s corporations great protection for its board of directors, even if you are the only member on the board and own all of the shares. In the last 24 years the Nevada courts have only allowed the corporate veil to be pierced twice, and both were for outright fraud cases. In comparison, one out of very two cases in California.\nNevada does not exchange information with the IRS.\nThe only other state to do this is Texas. Keep in mind that if you must register your corporation in another state, the state laws there will apply.\nCurrently the filing fees with Nevada are $125.\nNevada offers protection of Board of Directors from shareholder lawsuits.\nThe shareholders must prove gross negligence in order to find the Board of Directors liable. And to prove gross negligence is to pierce the corporate veil in Nevada.\nIn Nevada, you must only have a legal purpose to form a corporation or LLC.\nMeaning, a person could form a Nevada LLC to hold personal assets. It is not required that the LLC have a business purpose to form.\nThere is no joint and several liabilities.\nThis means that if a judgment is entered against several defendants, they will each assume equal liability for the full amount of the judgment, regardless of their relative fault in causing the problem. In Nevada, courts are required to assign a percentage of faults to each defendant. And each defendant is only liable for their percentage.\nOne person can hold all of the corporate positions.\nNevada Protects the Board of Directors and Officers.\nIn 1987, Nevada passed a law permitting corporations to place their own provisions in their Articles of Incorporation that can eliminate the personal liablity of the officers and directors to the stockholders. Furthermore, this provision is automatic in Nevada.\nMembers are not required to be listed in state records.\nStockholders, directors, and officers are not required to be US citizens or live or hold meetings in Nevada.\nNext post: Why Incorporate Your Business.",

    "text": "So, you suffer from Hay Fever or Allergic Rhinitis and are trying to decide which air purifier is most likely to help you, well you have come to the right place, we have great first hand experience of Hay fever in this office (unfortunately!) , and think we can definitely help to point you in the right direction, read on for our guide on choosing the best air purifier for relief from Hay Fever.\nWhat is the most important thing to consider?\nWhen it comes to removing tree , grass and shrub pollens the most important ingredient your air purifier must have is a good level of suction. Yup, that's right, the air purifier you choose will almost certainly have a filter capable of trapping those allergens, but if it doesn't have enough suction to actually draw them towards it quickly enough then it will not be of much use.\nHow do you work out how quickly an air purifier will gobble up those offending allergens then?\nThe first thing is to compare the CADR ( Clean Air Delivery Rate ) of the machines you are interested in. Generally speaking a higher CADR rating means quicker removal of the offending allergens in your room.\nIn order to be truly effective in gobbling up pollens an air purifier needs to be powerful enough to recirculate all of the air in YOUR room size through its filter as frequently as possible. As a guide, try to choose a machine which has enough air volume to process all the air in your largest room at least 3 times an hour. If you can get one which provides around 4 or 5 times an hour that would be even better.\nThe CADR rating on a box tells a consumer how efficient an air purifier is at actually removing the three main indoor pollutants, namely Pollen, Smoke and Dust. In this case, as a Hay Fever sufferer you should try to choose one where the pollen figure is highest. Clean Air Delivery Rate testing is carried out by an impartial and independent organisation called AHAM - a word of caution here though - not all manufacturers submit their units for certified testing to AHAM and may instead just list their own 'in house' test results on the box. If you want to be certain of what you are buying always choose a machine which has the genuine 'AHAM Certified' Seal on the box.\nBEWARE of the manufacturers over inflated 'recommended room sizes'.\nThis is where we believe most consumers get misled into spending good money on something which is never going to be powerful enough to provide them with genuine relief from their Hayfever. Manufacturers usually state on the product box and specification list that the air purifier is 'For Rooms up to...' and then quote a room size usually given in square metres (m2). This information is completely worthless unless it is also followed by another figure telling you how long it will take to clean the air in that size of room.\nOne blatant example of this currently available on the High Street is an air purifier range manufactured by VAX which on the face of it seems to be reasonable value for money. One of their units available for \u00a3199 in Argos has a Pollen CADR rating of 240. So we know it is capable of removing pollens and according to the manufacturers specification the unit is suitable for rooms up to 103m2. However, when you calculate the CADR rating and divide it into the claimed room size, it shows that the unit would take 65 minutes to clean the air once in a room that size, equating to a very poor 0.93 air changes an hour. Remember, we already know that an air purifier needs to provide at least 3-5 air changes an hour to be genuinely effective at removing allergens!\nAnother VAX unit at \u00a394.99 claims it will remove over 99% of allergens in rooms up to 87m2. Yet once again taking the CADR figure and working out the results clearly shows that this unit will take 69 minutes to purify the air once in that room size, equating to just 0.8 air changes an hour. These air purifiers may well still be effective in reducing Hay Fever symptoms, but realistically the room sizes in which they will be able to perform well are about 5 times smaller than those quoted.\nOK, enough of the technical stuff!\nTo cut through the numbers and make life a little simpler for us all, we have put together a list of air purifiers which we know will provide up to 5 air changes per hour in their recommended room size, and all of which have genuine AHAM certified CADR ratings. Simply click the link below to view our Air Purifiers for Hay Fever section As always, we do love to talk to our customers so please do not be hesitant, pick up the phone and give us a call on the number at the top of the page - or use our live chat to ask anything you want to know and we will do our best to help!",

His son described the love his father had for his mother as a \u201cperfect shelter.\u201d One of his closest friends spoke movingly of the time he spent with him on the many hikes they would take together in the Shenandoah Mountains. He was one of those rare people in this world who simply radiate goodness and light.\nI went alone to the service, and my husband stayed home with the kids. As I was leaving the house, I asked my family to think of something fun that we could all do together when I got back.

I have no idea where she hid the other one in this photo.\nI thought it might be a sign.\nNote that my daughter lost her coat, but found her other leg and also a big, cheesy grin.\nIt was a beautiful view worth hiking for, and it made me smile for the first time that day.\nMy Valentine for whom I hiked.

    "text": "On a proper construction of an agreement, which required a supplier of warehouse services to give credit to the user for additional business secured by the supplier in order to utilise spare capacity, the additional business did not include business conducted from an extension to the warehouse.\nThe appellants, a company (S) and a third party, appealed against a decision ((2008) EWCA Civ 1286)) that on a proper construction of an agreement, which required the respondent supplier of warehouse services (W) to give credit to S for additional business secured by W in order to utilise spare capacity, the additional business did not include business conducted from an extension to the warehouse. At one time all three parties had been subsidiaries in the same group. W had constructed a national distribution centre and had entered into an agreement with S to provide warehousing services at the centre to S. Later, W was demerged from the group and the centre became a multi-user site. Under a revised agreement between S and W, S agreed to put a minimum amount of goods through the centre annually, failing which S would be liable to make a volume shortfall payment to W. That payment was to be reduced to the extent that W secured additional third party business. Parts of S's business were then sold and the revised agreement was replaced by new agreements. A side letter provided that W should use reasonable endeavours to develop and secure additional business with a view to utilising spare capacity and throughput in the warehouse. By that time there was an extension to the warehouse at the centre. Unlike the original warehouse, which was a chilled facility and contained automated handling machinery, the extension was only partly chilled and had no automated handling machinery. A dispute arose when the threshold volume of goods under the agreement was not met and W claimed shortfall payments. The issue was whether the reference to the warehouse in the side letter was to the warehouse as originally constructed and not as extended. S contended that to have to distinguish between third party custom in two different parts of an integrated warehouse was uncommercial and unrealistic. S submitted that W had itself regarded all new business wherever it was sited within the extended warehouse as within the concept of additional business.\nFor the purposes of the instant appeal, it was sufficient to consider the third new agreement, the essential structure of which was the same as that of the revised agreement and, as was common ground, it was permissible to construe the new agreement and the side-letter against the background of that revised agreement, HIH Casualty & General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Co (2001) EWCA Civ 735, (2001) 2 All ER (Comm) 39 and Electrosteel Castings Ltd v Scan Trans Shipping & Chartering Sdn Bhd (2002) EWHC 1993 (Comm), (2002) 2 All ER (Comm) 1064 considered. Not only did neither the revised agreement nor the new agreement state that the warehouse services were to be provided in the extension to the warehouse as well as in the original warehouse, whether expressly or impliedly, but both agreements consisted of terms that only made sense on the basis that the services were to be provided only in the original warehouse. In particular, the original warehouse was both chilled and automated, which were requirements of the services to be provided and governed the parameters of those services; the provisions in the agreements repeatedly reflected the size and capacity of the original warehouse; a growth in S's requirements which would put a strain on that capacity would require fresh agreement, and for that purpose the extension and alternative sites were spoken of as pertaining to the same subject matter but that was entirely opposite to the proposition that warehouse included the extension; there were detailed provisions in both agreements for material change in either services or charges without any reference to the extension; and it was further significant that the revised and new agreements addressed the new situation created by the demerger of W and its pursuit of new third party business without reference to the extension. Also, the warehouse was not as integrated as suggested by S. The extension was only partly chilled and not at all automated. Different services suggested different customers. Further, as the judge had suggested, it was uncommercial that S should be entitled to participate, where a volume shortfall occurred, in the profits generated by the extension without any contribution to the cost of the extension, which would be borne entirely by W. Those considerations made a powerful case that the reference to the warehouse in the side letter was to the warehouse as originally constructed and not as extended.",

    "text": "How long does it take the flu to evade a vaccine?\nWith all the recent Presidential attention to the threat from the H5N1 Avian Flu, and the many billions now earmarked for stockpiling vaccines and drugs, it seems like a good idea to ask on what time scale the virus might be able to evade these countermeasures. Vaccination is of particular interest, as it is regarded as by far the best tool to combat viral infection at the population level.\nGenomic analyses of H5N1 isolates from birds and humans showed 2 distinct clades with a nonoverlapping geographic distribution. All the viral genes were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses.\nGenetic and antigenic analyses have shown that, compared to previous H5N1 isolates, 2004-2005 isolates share several amino acid changes that modulate antigenicity and perhaps other biological function. Furthermore, our molecular analysis of the HA from isolates collected in 2005 suggests that several amino acids located near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which may affect antigenicity or transmisibility.\nDespite the recent \"Isolation of drug-resistant H5N1 virus,\" (Nature, 20 October 2005), the WHO Global Influenza team determined that recent isolates are \"sensitive to 2 neuraminidase inhibitors that are recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention against human infections.\" So obviously the specific details of which viral isolate one is working with determine its sensitivity to drugs. In the case of the drug-resistant strain, it was isolated in February 2005 from a Vietnamese girl who may have contracted the virus while she cared for her brother. Human-to-human transmission is supported by the girl's lack of contact with poultry and the fact that the neuraminidase gene from virus isolated from the girl was virtually identical to that isolated from her brother. Thus there are evidently drug resistant strains running around in the wild.\nAs far as I can tell, it just isn't yet clear how fast drug-resistance traits can spread. There is now at least a little data about how long it takes a particular viral strain to find work-arounds for vaccines. A recent initial effort to sequence many flu strains in parallel indicates that mutations that provide ways around vaccines can rapidly dominate a population of flu viruses.\nPerhaps the most dramatic finding in our data is the discovery of an epidemiologically significant reassortment that explains the appearance, during the 2003-2004 season, of the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like strain, for which the existing vaccine had limited effectiveness. ...Phylogenetic analysis of 156 H3N2 genomes from our project revealed the clear presence of multiple, distinct clades circulating in the population. Through a reassortment event, a minor clade provided the haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain after the 2002-2003 season.\nThis finding illustrates not only that the influenza virus population contains multiple lineages at any given time, but also that alternate, minor lineages can contribute genetic variation to the dominant lineage, resulting in epidemiologically significant, antigenically novel strains. It is worth emphasizing that our sequence-based sampling approach--in contrast to traditional serologically based sampling--will reveal co-circulating strains even before they become antigenically novel.\nIn other words, the authors assert that amongst viruses that we give the same name there is considerable variation that may be hard to distinguish using traditional techniques. Sequencing the genomes of many isolates can provide a map of how a population of viruses is changing in response to vaccines. Ghedin, et al., note that their work demonstrates significant change of the dominant flu strain even within the 2003-2004 flu season. That variation appeared to originate and then dominate the population of viruses within 12 months.\nWhich brings me to the core of this post, namely that we now have real-world data demonstrating that flu viruses can escape vaccines in less than a year, far shorter than the time it takes to produce significant quantities of effective vaccines. It is important to note that this is a different problem than producing a new vaccine for new annual flu strains every year. If a pandemic strain emerges, our problem is not planning ahead just far enough to deploy a vaccine for next year's strain, but rather to combat a strain already killing people worldwide. It took most of a year for the CDC and Sanofi to come up with a hypothetical H5N1 vaccine, and the new National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza contains the expectation of years to accumulate enough vaccine to be useful for large populations. Never mind that the existing whole virus vaccine may not be effective against a pandemic strain.\nThe fact that the minor Fujian-like clade has donated its HA to the previously dominant strain rather than itself becoming the dominant circulating virus indicates that there may be important amino acid co-substitutions in the other proteins essential for viral fitness.\n...Even within a geographically constrained set of isolates, we have found surprising genetic diversity, indicating that the reservoir of influenza A strains in the human population -- and the concomitant potential for segment exchange between strains -- may be greater than was previously suspected.\nWe cannot think of the H5N1, or any other strain, as either a clonal population experiencing selection or as a bunch of individuals producing descendants that may accumulate mutations leading to a pandemic strain. Rather, flu viruses exists as elements of a population that appear to be constantly innovating and trading parts. This is a critical distinction, particularly in light of rapid human and avian intercontinental travel. Not only have we now learned that there is greater variation in any given set of geographically linked isolates, but because of human travel we can expect all kinds of novel parts to show up in populations that were otherwise isolated and appeared to be of no immediate threat.\nThe Ghedin paper doesn't necessarily teach us directly about the evolution of pandemic flu strains, but it does suggest our current plan for pandemic vaccination is not well suited for the problem at hand.\nAfter studying synthetic vaccines for Bio-ERA, amongst other clients, I think DNA vaccines are the best bet for rapid response on a time scale shorter than flu strains seem to evolve. I've a draft paper on synthetic vaccines in for consideration at Biosecurity and Bioterrorism, and will shortly embark on another paper specifically about distributed manufacture of DNA vaccines. PowderMed is waiting for publication of their (already accepted) first paper on their plasmid vaccine for the annual flu and will be starting trials of an H5N1 DNA vaccine early next year. Unfortunately, it seems the folks in DC aren't taking this technology seriously, and instead blowing billions on developing cell culture production of whole virus vaccines. Even the folks who manufacture vaccines in cell culture acknowledge this will only cut a month or two off the response time.",

It is difficult to comprehend that this film, Road Racers, was made 40 years ago, let alone the impact this film would have in years to come, the place it has in people\u2019s hearts and the iconic level that it has reached across the whole road racing community.\n\u201cThe Armoy Road Races came about as most of you know, after a bit of craic in a local pub. It\u2019s hard to believe come September that we will be in our tenth year and that we continue to celebrate all of our road racers, past and present, including the reputed Armoy Armada.\n\u201cIt is also hard to be believe how exceptionally fast 2017 is disappearing but we are on target with our planning. With additional monies from the Department of Communities and some work on the roads, courtesy of Transport NI, these races are set to be one of the best.\n\u201cWilliam Dunlop was man of the meeting in 2016 and I\u2019ve no doubt he will be keen to revisit his Armoy winning streak. As of yet, brother, Michael Dunlop, who retains the title of Race of Legends winner, having won in six successive years has yet to confirm his entry but the Club is hopeful he will race on his home course come July.\nAlso in attendance were the Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Councillor Joan Baird, Terence Brannigan, Chairman of Tourism Northern Ireland, members of the Armoy Club and other guests and sponsors including title &apos;Race of Legends&apos; sponsor, Roadside Kia.\nTerence Brannigan, Tourism NI Chairman also commented: \u201cArmoy Road Races are one of Northern Ireland\u2019s prime motorsport gatherings, attracting motorcycle riders and spectators both locally and internationally.\n\"As the event goes from strength to strength it has an important role to play in tourism, in contributing to the economy and in enhancing our reputation as a destination.\nBill Kennedy concluded: \u201cI\u2019d like to finish by thanking event sponsors Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and Tourism NI for their very kind support.\n\"I\u2019d also like to thank our title sponsor Roadside Kia. Without the support and sponsorship from these organisations and other sponsors present here today, the event just wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nThis year, Bike Week runs from Sunday July 23 until Saturday July 29 with the races taking place on Friday, July 28 and Saturday, July 29 culminating in the Roadside Kia \u2018Race of Legends\u2019.\nThe Armoy Road Races are part funded by Tourism Northern Ireland and the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council.",

The acid reacts similarly with skin, cellulose, and other plant and animal matter.\nWhen the concentrated acid mixes with water, large amounts of heat are released; enough heat can be released at once to boil the water and spatter the acid. To dilute the acid, the acid should be added slowly to cold water with constant stirring to limit the buildup of heat. Sulfuric acid reacts with water to form hydrates with distinct properties.\nA neutral atom or group of atoms becomes an ion by gaining or losing one or more electrons or protons.\nchemical compound containing the sulfate (SO4) radical. Sulfates are salts or esters of sulfuric acid, H2SO4, formed by replacing one or both of the hydrogens with a metal (e.g., sodium) or a radical (e.g., ammonium or ethyl).\n.....

Since it is dibasic (i.e., it has two replaceable hydrogen atoms in each molecule), it forms both normal sulfates (with both hydrogens replaced, e.g., sodium sulfate, Na2SO4) and acid sulfates, also called bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates (with only one hydrogen replaced, e.g., sodium bisulfate, NaHSO4).\nchemical compound, SO2, a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. It is readily soluble in cold water, sparingly soluble in hot water, and soluble in alcohol, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid.\n.....

The sulfur dioxide is obtained by burning sulfur, by burning pyrites (iron sulfides), by roasting nonferrous sulfide ores preparatory to smelting, or by burning hydrogen sulfide gas. Some sulfuric acid is also made from ferrous sulfate waste solutions from pickling iron and steel and from waste acid sludge from oil refineries.\nIn the lead chamber process hot sulfur dioxide gas enters the bottom of a reactor called a Glover tower where it is washed with nitrous vitriol (sulfuric acid with nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, dissolved in it) and mixed with nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide gases; some of the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide and dissolved in the acid wash to form tower acid or Glover acid (about 78% H2SO4). From the Glover tower a mixture of gases (including sulfur dioxide and trioxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam) is transferred to a lead-lined chamber where it is reacted with more water. The chamber may be a large, boxlike room or an enclosure in the form of a truncated cone. Sulfuric acid is formed by a complex series of reactions; it condenses on the walls and collects on the floor of the chamber. There may be from three to twelve chambers in a series; the gases pass through each in succession. The acid produced in the chambers, often called chamber acid or fertilizer acid, contains 62% to 68% H2SO4. After the gases have passed through the chambers they are passed into a reactor called the Gay-Lussac tower where they are washed with cooled concentrated acid (from the Glover tower); the nitrogen oxides and unreacted sulfur dioxide dissolve in the acid to form the nitrous vitriol used in the Glover tower. Remaining waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere.\nIn the contact process, purified sulfur dioxide and air are mixed, heated to about 450\u00b0C;, and passed over a catalyst; the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide. The catalyst is usually platinum on a silica or asbestos carrier or vanadium pentoxide on a silica carrier. The sulfur trioxide is cooled and passed through two towers. In the first tower it is washed with oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, 100% sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide dissolved in it). In the second tower it is washed with 97% sulfuric acid; 98% sulfuric acid is usually produced in this tower. Waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere. Acid of any desired concentration may be produced by mixing or diluting the products of this process.\nSulfuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals. More of it is made each year than is made of any other manufactured chemical; more than 40 million tons of it were produced in the United States in 1990. It has widely varied uses and plays some part in the production of nearly all manufactured goods. The major use of sulfuric acid is in the production of fertilizers, e.g., superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate. It is widely used in the manufacture of chemicals, e.g., in making hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfate salts, synthetic detergents, dyes and pigments, explosives, and drugs. It is used in petroleum refining to wash impurities out of gasoline and other refinery products. Sulfuric acid is used in processing metals, e.g., in pickling (cleaning) iron and steel before plating them with tin or zinc. Rayon is made with sulfuric acid. It serves as the electrolyte in the lead-acid storage battery commonly used in motor vehicles (acid for this use, containing about 33% H2SO4 and with specific gravity about 1.25, is often called battery acid).\nAlthough sulfuric acid is now one of the most widely used chemicals, it was probably little known before the 16th cent. It was prepared by Johann Van Helmont (c.1600) by destructive distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) and by burning sulfur. The first major industrial demand for sulfuric acid was the Leblanc process for making sodium carbonate (developed c.1790). Sulfuric acid was produced at Nordhausen from green vitriol but was expensive. A process for its synthesis by burning sulfur with saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was first used by Johann Glauber in the 17th cent. and developed commercially by Joshua Ward in England c.1740. It was soon superseded by the lead chamber process, invented by John Roebuck in 1746 and since improved by many others. The contact process was originally developed c.1830 by Peregrine Phillips in England; it was little used until a need for concentrated acid arose, particularly for the manufacture of synthetic organic dyes.\nH2 SO4, a strong dibasic acid corresponding to the highest oxidation state of sulfur (+ 6). Under usual conditions, sulfuric acid is a heavy, oily, colorless, and odorless liquid. In industry, mixtures of sulfuric acid both with water and sulfur trioxide are also called sulfuric acid. If the SO3: H2 O molecular ratio is less than 1, the mixture is an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid; if it is more than 1, the mixture is a solution of SO3 in sulfuric acid.\nThe compounds H2 SO4\u00b7SO3 (H2 S2 O7, disulfuric, or pyrosulfuric acid, mp 35.15\u00b0C) and H2 SO4\u00b72SO3 (H2 S3 O10, trisulfuric acid, mp 1.20\u00b0C) are also formed. Only water vapor is given off into the vapor phase upon heating and boiling aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid containing up to 70 percent H2 S04. Vapors of sulfuric acid are formed above more concentrated solutions. A solution of 98.3 percent H2 SO4 (azeotropic mixture) upon boiling (336.5\u00b0C) is completely distilled. Sulfuric acid containing more than 98.3 percent H2 SO4 releases vapors of SO3 upon heating.\nSulfuric acid removes water that is chemically bound to organic compounds containing OH, or hydroxyl, groups. The dehydration of ethyl alcohol in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid results in the formation of ethylene or diethyl ether. The charring of sugar, cellulose, starch, and other carbohydrates upon contact with sulfuric acid also derives from the dehydration of these substances. As a dibasic acid, sulfuric acid forms two types of salts: sulfates and bisulfates.\nProduction. The first descriptions of oil of vitriol, that is, concentrated sulfuric acid, were given by the Italian scientist V. Biringuccio in 1540 and the German alchemist whose works were published under the name of Basilius Valentinus in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1690, the French chemists N. Lemery and N. Lefebvre had laid the basis for the first industrial method of obtaining sulfuric acid, a method applied in England in 1740. According to this method, a mixture of sulfur and saltpeter was burned in a ladle suspended in a glass jar containing a certain amount of water. The SO3 generated reacted with the water to form sulfuric acid. In 1746, J. Roebuck in Birmingham replaced the glass jars with chambers made of sheet lead, thus laying the basis for the chamber process for the production of sulfuric acid. Continuous improvement in the process for the production of sulfuric acid in Great Britain and France resulted in 1908 in the first tower system. In the USSR, the first tower installation went into operation in 1926 at the Po-levskoi Metallurgical Plant in the Urals.\nThe raw material for the production of sulfuric acid can be sulfur, pyrite (FeS2), or exhaust gases containing SO2 from furnaces for the oxidative roasting of the sulfide ores of Cu, Pb, Zn, and other metals. In the USSR, most sulfuric acid is obtained from pyrite. Here, the FeS2 is burned in furnaces in the state of a fluidized bed, a state achieved by blowing a rapid stream of air through a layer of finely ground pyrite. The gaseous mixture obtained contains SO2, O2, N2, impurities of SO3, and vapors of H2 O, As2 O3, and SiO2 and holds considerable cinder dust, which is removed from the gas in electrostatic precipitators.\nThe NO produced is converted into N2 O3, or, more precisely, a mixture of NO and NO2, in the oxidizing tower. The gases are then introduced into absorption towers, where they encounter sulfuric acid supplied from the top. It is here that nitrous vitriol is obtained; the mixture is then transferred to the production towers. Thus, there is continuous production and a circulation of nitrogen oxides. The inevitable losses of nitrogen oxides with the exhaust gases are balanced by the addition of HNO3.\nThe sulfuric acid produced by the nitrous method is of insufficient concentration and contains harmful impurities, for example. As. Production is accompanied by the release of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere (\u201cfoxtails,\u201d named for the color of NO2).\nDepending on the amount of water introduced into the process, either oleum or a solution of sulfuric acid in water is obtained.\nIn 1973 the production of sulfuric acid (in the monohydrate) was (in millions of tons): 14.9 in the USSR, 28.7 in the United States, 7.1 in Japan, 5.5 in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4.4 in France, 3.9 in Great Britain, 3.0 in Italy, 2.9 in Poland, 1.2 in Czechoslovakia, 1.1 in the German Democratic Republic, and 0.9 in Yugoslavia.\nUSE. Sulfuric acid is one of the most important products of the heavy chemical industry. The available grades include chamber acid (not less than 75 percent H2 SO4), oil of vitriol (not less than 92.5 percent), and oleum, or fuming sulfuric acid (a solution of 18.5\u201320 percent SO3 in H2 SO4), as well as especially pure battery acid (92\u201394 percent; when diluted by water to 26\u201331 percent, it serves as the electrolyte in lead batteries). In addition, reagent-grade sulfuric acid (92\u201394 percent) is produced by the contact process in quartz or platinum apparatus. The strength of sulfuric acid is determined by the density, which is measured with a hydrometer. Most of the chamber acid is used in the production of mineral fertilizers. Sulfuric acid is used in the production of, for example, phosphoric, hydrochloric, boric, and hydrofluoric acids because of its ability to displace these acids from their salts. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used in separating organosulfur compounds and unsaturated organic compounds from petroleum products. Dilute sulfuric acid is used for the removal of scale from wire and sheets before plating with tin or zinc and for the pickling of metal surfaces before plating with chromium, nickel, or copper. It is used in metallurgy for the decomposition of complex ores, in particular, those of uranium. In organic synthesis, concentrated sulfuric acid is a necessary component of nitrating mixtures and a sulfonating agent in the production of many dyes and pharmaceuticals. Owing to its high hygroscopicity, sulfuric acid is used in drying gases and in concentrating nitric acid.\nSafety measures. Poisonous gases\u2014SO2 and NO2\u2014as well as vapors of SO3 and H2 SO4, present a danger in the production of sulfuric acid. Proper ventilation and hermetically sealed production apparatus are therefore mandatory. Since sulfuric acid causes serious burns of the skin, handling requires extreme care and protective devices (goggles, rubber gloves, aprons, boots). When diluting sulfuric acid, the acid must be poured into water in a thin stream while stirring. Pouring the water into the acid leads to spattering because of the evolution of a great amount of heat.\nSpravochnik sernokislotchika, 2nd ed. Edited by K. M. Malin. Moscow, 1971.\nMalin, K. M., N.

    "text": "Often confused with the Stiff Leg Deadlift or Straight Leg Deadlift, the Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is a variation of the deadlift that is used mainly to strengthen hamstrings, back, and forearms (grip).\nHopefully, you regularly have deadlifts in your training program, if not, learn how to do so properly.\nDeadlifts are the king of leg exercises for a reason. They are a compound movement that hits almost every muscle in the body. Those looking to increase the amount of weight they lift off the ground should look to different variations of the movement to help strengthen weak points.\nWhen lifting heavy, there are two common areas of difficulty; grip strength and lat strength.\nAs you start to move towards the ground, the bar should stay close to the body, by using the lats. If the lats are not strong enough, the upper back can start to round, leading to rounding of the lower back(not good). The bar should travel in a straight line at all times to minimize the distance the bar moves.\nGrip strength is also necessary to control the bar on the way up and back down towards the ground. Lack of grip strength can cause compensations in your lower back, especially as the weight gets heavy.\nAlong with doing work that isolates the lats and grip, you should also do movements that mimic the deadlift but allow you to build strength on weak points. In a RDL, the bar starts at the top and you lower the bar but only until just below the knee. During the entire lift, you need to maintain proper control and since the bar never reaches the ground, it challenges your grip and lat strength in a great way.\nPosition the bar at about mid-thigh height.\nWalk up and place your hands on the bar just outside of your thigs.\nPosition your feet around hip width apart with your toes pointed forward.\nSqueeze your shoulder blades together and load your hips as you bring the bar down to just below your knees.\nYou should feel tension in the hamstrings and glutes at this point.\nRaise the bar back up to starting position.\nNote: The bar never travels to the floor, the reason is that you want to keep max tension on the hamstrings. Your back is also neutral for the entire lift.\nThis is great movement to add into your workoutsto help work on weak points in your deadlift. It can be done after your regular deadlifts or on a separate day.\nCheck out this great video from Brett Contreras on how to do an RDL (0:36-1:28).",

What started out small has now led to several yearly trips to countries around the world. Recently, our team was able to complete the 100th short-term medical and dental outreach in Zambia. Here are some of the lives you were able to impact in the span of just one day!\nOscar came to our medical tent reporting that he was randomly falling down every month. Just the night before, he had fallen down and sustained a traumatic injury to his right arm. The doctor said that it was the type of fracture that could have very easily severed his main artery in his arm. After Oscar\u2019s examination, it was determined that he had a seizure disorder. Unfortunately, he had no way of getting to the hospital for treatment, so we paid for his transport. By diagnosing his disorder, our team hoped he could avoid future injuries to his body.\nSweet Grace came to our outreach hunched over and suffering for aches that most 89-year-olds would experience. However, she did not have the simple medicines available to help. Our team was able to give her aspirin, blood pressure medicine and pills for her muscles; such simple solutions to the pain she was feeling. Our team was also happy to pray with Grace before she left; \u201cNow after prayer, I feel that my body has become normal. It doesn\u2019t feel as badly as before.\u201d She left standing much straighter!\n67-year-old Alex had been having trouble with his eyes for at least two years. He was not able to see clearly, and which caused him difficulty when reading. After meeting with one of our volunteers, he received a pair of glasses and was so ecstatic to be able to read again. What was the first book he picked up? One of Joyce\u2019s from the prayer tent!\nWe\u2019ve been able to treat 297,923 patients and see 106,056 salvations over the course of 100 trips, but there are so many more lives to reach!

    "text": "Do You Need a Master\u2019s in Education Degree To Qualify for Tenure?\nIf you are currently an educator or you are mapping out the route that you will take to become one, you may want to know if you need a Master in Education degree to qualify for tenure. To work as a full-time, tenure-track educator, you must meet certain requirements and prove that you are skilled and passionate about your role. Tenure offers you great protection in your career but every state and educational system has their own path that you must take. Read on, and find out when a master\u2019s is and is not required.\nWhat is a Tenure and Why is it So Important?\nTenure is technically defined as the right to due process so that high schools, colleges and other educational institutions cannot legally fire a teacher or professor without providing evidence that they are not competent or they have been inappropriate, according to the National Education Association. Since evidence must be provided and there is an entire process that school officials must follow, only about 2% of professors on the tenure-track lose their job annually.\nTo get your tenure, you must complete a probationary period and show that you are professional and competent in your role. While a professor is on probation, it is okay for the seniors in charge of hiring to fire the professor without cause at any time and go with a new faculty contract. The senior professors in charge of evaluation will work with administrators and new non-tenured faculty to evaluate their research capabilities and how they service the classroom to decide if they are deserving of tenure. If there are not recommended for tenure, the professor will lose their job and probation starts over when they begin under a new teaching contract.\nHow Long Does it Take to Become a Tenured Educator?\nOnly about one-third of college professors are tenured faculty, and this is a major cause for concern in the field. If you are hired on the tenure-track in a college setting, it typically will take about three years at a junior college and seven years at a four-year college to be granted tenure. If you are working in a high school, middle school or primary school, everything is based on the state law that applies to public schools.\nSome states have five-year requirements and others have 10-year requirements where all public school teachers are considered \u2018on probation\u2019. The average tenure-track duration in the United States is about seven years when you average the laws across the country.\nYou might assume that getting a graduate degree is the number one way for getting through probation, but that is not always the case. A master\u2019s degree in education will help you strengthen your knowledge on curriculum development, instruction, administration or counseling, but it is not centered around teaching specifically. It is more focused on the educational system than educating your students like a Master\u2019s of Arts in Teaching.\nOne drawback of having your master\u2019s before you are tenured is that it tempts the school to let go of you and secure a contract with a young, Bachelor\u2019s degree holding teacher who will cost less. If you wait until after you are tenured, the school cannot let you go because you decided to advance your education level.\nIf you would like to research types of M.Ed. programs that you can take and schools that offer them, it is time to seek out accredited programs. Once you know that you do not need a Master in Education degree to qualify for tenure, start focusing on teaching first and then focus on graduate programs.",

This time in your life can be exciting and overwhelming all at once. It\u2019s important to take good care of yourself during your pregnancy and regularly visit all of your healthcare practitioners. Believe it or not, it\u2019s especially important to visit your dentist in Weatherford throughout your pregnancy. Here are the reasons why.\nBecause of the many hormone changes that take place throughout pregnancy, you are more susceptible to periodontal disease, or gum disease during this time. This may not seem like too big a deal, however periodontal disease can lead to tooth, tissue, and bone loss if it\u2019s not properly managed. A condition known as pregnancy gingivitis can occur, and this is actually the first stage of gum disease.\nIf you notice that your gums are red and swollen, or bleed when you brush your dentist may recommend extra cleaning appointments during your pregnancy to help you control the gingivitis. Excellent home care, with daily brushing and flossing is also crucial during this time. If you suffer from morning sickness and vomiting, your dentist can recommend a mouth rinse to help protect your teeth from harmful stomach acids.\nAs you know, your nutrition is very important to you and your baby during pregnancy, did you know however, that your nutrition could affect your baby\u2019s developing teeth? It\u2019s true! Your baby\u2019s teeth will begin to develop around the third to sixth month of your pregnancy and you need lots of vitamin A, C, and D as well as protein and calcium to help your child\u2019s teeth develop properly. You will need to begin oral care for your child as well as soon as their first teeth erupt.\nLet your dentist know that you\u2019re pregnant and exactly what trimester you\u2019re in. your dentist may want to wait on taking x-rays or performing dental treatment until you\u2019re further along in your pregnancy.\nIf you experience dental pain or an emergency contact your dentist right away. There are a lot of things that can be done for dental pain during your pregnancy even if you don\u2019t have treatment done immediately.

    "text": "Perhaps you make a good point there bizaro. My past experience in following FFH's investments has made me gun shy of doing that. These guys are in a different game and this could be a sound idea.\n1) Lundin is a much larger company (by market cap) than Yamana. They have more financial resources to fund the $250 million expansion projects at Chapada (throughout increase and Sucupira pit pushback).\n2) Lundin is a copper-focused company. Chapada is primarily a copper mine with significant gold credits. Lundin spends a lot of money aggressively exploring for copper at its properties. The Yamana copper reserves and resource growth will likely ramp up under Lundin's exploration team.\nThis is more or less the entire argument, if you ask me. Just can take a LOOOOONG time to play out given how long cycles last and how long it takes to get a mine from idea to production.\nBHP makes a strategic investment in Midland, way above current market price. C$5.9 million raised at 1.70 a share.\nBHP gets right of first offer on Mythril. If the drilling hits BHP wants the project because it is potentially a very large copper deposit (based upon the IP surveys).\nLundin conference call emphasizes that they have no capital constraints compared to Yamana. They plan to bring copper production forward in an aggressive manner. I expect the gold-only Suruca deposit to be shelved, while Chapada expansion timeline will be accelerated. Yamana had been slowplaying the major expansion spending to try to keep a cash flow positive profile for a few years.\nI can imagine the conservatives putting political pressure on the utilities to delay the coal power plant conversions a few years to save thousands of coal mine or coal power plant related jobs. Phaseout is inevitable but the exact timing is still up in the air, especially for the Genesee plants.\nWolfden Resources cutting timber for forest management has been kicking out revenue to Altius. Altius gets 20% of the sales receipts from timber sales. Altius received C$92,232 in timber revenue in 2018, and has received C$66,299 so far in 2019. See Wolfden\u2019s most recent MD&A. I believe these sales receipts become part of Altius\u2019s project generation revenue.\nThese regular sales are separate from what will eventually be a total sale of the Mt. Pickett timber rights (for at least US$5 million).\nBecause the total sale of timber rights didn\u2019t happen by November 2018 Altius can now, at any time, demand the return of what it paid for the Mt. Pickett royalty, C$7.663 million, in cash or shares of Wolfden.\nWolfden was a speculative royalty deal but Altius built some excellent protections into the deal.\nStrong Q1 performance and raised guidance. Potash is performing very well.\nAltius should be in striking range for C$90 million total revenue in 2019 (royalty and project generation revenue). This preliminary Q1 royalty number doesn\u2019t include ~C$300K from Voisey\u2019s Bay and PG revenue (timber sales etc). LIF must keep paying out and Chapada should have a big second half of the year with the improved recovery circuits installed this quarter. Maybe a couple hundred thousand extra revenue from Excelsior in Q4.\n90 million would be quite a reach. I will stick with 80 million for the year. Lundin buying Chapada, UCP win, highest quarter royalty revenue record, raised guidance and Altius barely moves. I think CapitalCities comment about the market not caring sums it up nicely.",

Subsequently, passing over the FS railway station Milano Certosa of the Milan-Novara line, the A4 motorway and the EXPO 2015 area, it ends with a partial junction on the A8 'Milano Laghi' motorway in north direction.\nThe layout has been designed in such a way that, in the future, an extension would be possible to reach the S.S. 233 'Varesina' and the SP 40 'Rho-Monza'.\nThe main works included in the design are the artificial tunnel passing under the area of the Integrated Intervention Plan in Cascina Merlata and the viaduct originating south of the intersected railway line and ending at the A8 motorway.\nBuilt with the characteristic excavation method 'Milan type' (which allows to minimize construction times and impact on the territory during the works) and the innovative system of the 'white tank' (thanks to which waterproof concrete can be obtained already during processing), the artificial tunnel develops for approx. 1 km, bypassing the S.S.33 del Sempione and joining the roads leading to the Western by-pass road at Molino Dorino.\nThe system of bridges and viaducts is made of a series of steel arches: for the bridges on the A4 and A8 motorways, these elements have a structural function; while along the EXPO viaduct they only have an aesthetic function, aimed at making the whole project look organic and well fitted into the urban context of 'EXPO 2015' and creating the so-called 'Door of Milan' (a distinctive element for those who drive on the road from and to the city center).\nThe whole elevated system is made even more homogeneous and characteristic by the covering 'guard' of the decks, an external metal coating of Alucobond that ensures continuity among the works. Thanks to specific lighting studies, the presence of this element helps create an appealing play of light during the evening and in the night.",

    "text": "We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriously.\nIf the people of that time were so gullible or credulous or superstitious, then we have to be very cautious when assessing the reliability of witnesses of Jesus. As Thomas Jefferson believed when he composed his own version of the gospels, Jesus may have been an entirely different person than the Gospels tell us, since the supernatural and other facts about him, even some of his parables or moral sayings, could easily have been added or exaggerated by unreliable witnesses or storytellers. Thus, this essay is not about whether Jesus was real or how much of what we are told about him is true. It is not even about Jesus. Rather, this essay is a warning and a standard, by which we can assess how likely or easily what we are told about Jesus may be false or exaggerated, and how little we can trust anyone who claims to be a witness of what he said and did. For if all of these other stories below could be told and believed, even by Christians themselves, it follows that the Gospels, being of entirely the same kind, can all too easily be inaccurate, tainted by the gullibility, credulity, or fondness for the spectacular which characterized most people of the time.\nEven in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.\nBeyond the bible, the historian Josephus supplies some insights. Writing toward the end of the first century, himself an eye-witness of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D, he tells us that the region was filled with \"cheats and deceivers claiming divine inspiration\" (Jewish War, 2.259-60; Jewish Antiquities, 20.167), entrancing the masses and leading them like sheep, usually to their doom. The most successful of these \"tricksters\" appears to be \"the Egyptian\" who led a flock of 30,000 believers around Palestine (Jewish War, 2.261-2; Paul is mistaken for him by a Roman officer in Acts 21:38). This fellow even claimed he could topple the walls of Jerusalem with a single word (Jewish Antiquities, 20.170), yet it took a massacre at the hands of Roman troops to finally instill doubt in his followers.\nTwenty years later, a common weaver named Jonathan would attract a mob of the poor and needy, promising to show them many signs and portents (Jewish War, 7.437-8). Again, it took military intervention to disband the movement. Josephus also names a certain Theudas, another \"trickster\" who gathered an impressive following in Cyrene around 46 A.D., claiming he was a prophet and could part the river Jordan (Jewish Antiquities, 20.97). This could be the same Theudas mentioned in Acts 5:36. Stories like these also remind us of the faithful following that Simon was reported to have had in Acts 8:9-11, again showing how easy it was to make people believe you had \"the power of god\" at your disposal. Jesus was not unique in that respect.\nMiracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!\nMiraculous healings were also commonplace. Suetonius, another biographer writing a generation after Plutarch, reports that even the emperor Vespasian once cured the blind and lame (Life of Vespasian 7.13; this \"power\" being attributed to the god Serapis--incidentally the Egyptian counterpart to Asclepius; cf. also Tacitus, Histories 4.81). Likewise, statues with healing powers were common attractions for sick people of this era. Lucian mentions the famous healing powers of a statue of Polydamas, an athlete, at Olympia, as well as the statue of Theagenes at Thasos (Council of the Gods 12). Both are again mentioned by Pausanias, in his \"tour guide\" of the Roman world (6.5.4-9, 11.2-9). Lucian also mentions the curative powers of the statue of a certain General Pellichos (Philopseudes 18-20). And Athenagoras, in his Legatio pro Christianis (26), polemicizes against the commonplace belief in the healing powers of statues, mentioning, in addition to the statue of a certain Neryllinus, the statues of Proteus and Alexander, the same two men I discuss in detail below.\nBut above all these, the \"pagans\" had Asclepius, their own healing savior, centuries before, and after, the ministry of Christ. Surviving testimonies to his influence and healing power throughout the classical age are common enough to fill a two-volume book (Edelstein and Edelstein, Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies, in two volumes, 1945--entries 423-450 contain the most vivid testimonials). Of greatest interest are the inscriptions set up for those healed at his temples. These give us almost first hand testimony, more reliable evidence than anything we have for the miracles of Jesus, of the blind, the lame, the mute, even the victims of kidney stones, paralytics, and one fellow with a spearhead stuck in his jaw (see the work cited above, p. 232), all being cured by this pagan \"savior.\" And this testimony goes on for centuries. Inscriptions span from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. and later, all over the Roman Empire. Clearly, the people of this time were quite ready to believe such tales. They were not remarkable tales at all.\nThis more general evidence of credulity in the Roman Empire shows the prevalence of belief in divine miracle working of all kinds. I will now present you with three historical individuals who truly flesh out the picture.\nApollonius, Peregrinus, and Alexander are three rather interesting religious founders about whom we know even more than we do of Jesus. The first, Apollonius of Tyana, is often called the \"pagan Christ,\" since he also lived during the first century, and performed a similar ministry of miracle-working, preaching his own brand of ascetic Pythagoreanism--he was also viewed as the son of a god, resurrected the dead, ascended to heaven, performed various miracles, and criticized the authorities with pithy wisdom much like Jesus did.\nNaturally, his story is one that no doubt grew into more and more fantastic legends over time, until he becomes an even more impressive miracle-worker than Jesus in the largest surviving work on him, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written by Philostratus around 220 A.D. This work is available today in two volumes as part of the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, a set that also includes the surviving fragments of Apollonius' own writings (if only Jesus had bothered to write something!) as well as the Treatise against him by the Christian historian Eusebius. There were other books written about him immediately after his death, but none survive.\nEven Eusebius, in his Treatise against Apollonius, does not question his existence, or the reality of many of his miracles--rather, he usually tries to attribute them to trickery or demons. This shows the credulity of the times, even among educated defenders of the Christian faith, but it also shows how easy it was to deceive. Since they readily believed in demons and magical powers, it should not surprise us that they believed in resurrections and transmutations of water to wine.\nWe also know that the cult that grew up around Apollonius survived for many centuries after his death. An inscription from as late as the 3rd century names him as a sort of pagan \"absolver of sins,\" sent from heaven (Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., 1996). The emperor Caracalla erected a shrine to him in Tyana around 215 A.D (Dio Cassius, 78.18; for a miraculous display of clairvoyance on the part of Apollonius, see 67.18). According to one account, the ghost of Apollonius even appeared to the emperor Aurelian to convince him to stop his siege of Tyana, whereupon he also erected a shrine to him around 274 A.D. (Historia Augusta: Vita Aureliani 24.2-6).\nLater Arabic sources even discuss the fame and potency of certain relics associated with him, which remained in use well into the sixth and seventh centuries, the last of them apparently destroyed by crusaders in 1204 A.D. So popular was the belief in the power of these \"talismans\" that the Church was forced to accept their use, even while condemning Apollonius and his shrines as demonic (see sources below). And so, we see here an independent confirmation that blind belief in the divine status and miraculous powers of mere mortals easily captivated the people of this time, a fact that even modern Christians must admit.\nAn even more colorful story is that of a crazy fellow called Peregrinus, nicknamed \"Proteus,\" who set himself on fire during the Olympic games in 165 A.D. to prove his faith in reincarnation. The notion of suicide as a proof of such faith was not new. Indian Brahmans had immolated themselves before Western audiences on several occasions before, the most famous being Calanus, at Susa, in front of Alexander the Great, and Zarmarus, at Athens, in front of Augustus (Plutarch, Alexander 69.8). What is most relevant, however, is the fascinating story told about him by the skeptic Lucian in his satirical work, \"The Death of Peregrinus.\" Lucian knew Proteus personally, and he gives us a look at what the story of Jesus might have been had a skeptic been around to give us a different account.\nWhile Aulus Gellius had also met this man in Athens, and was impressed enough to call him a man of \"dignity and fortitude\" (Attic Nights 11.1-7), Lucian had another point of view. He describes the vainglorious motivations of Proteus, and the duped mobs clamoring for a miracle. He also mentions the gullibility of Christians, who, he says, were easily duped by scam artists (13). Indeed, after the death of Peregrinus, people reported that he was, like Jesus, risen from the dead, wearing white raiment, and that he ascended to heaven in the form of a vulture (40). The punch line is that this latter story may have been a deliberate invention of Lucian himself (39), told to gullible followers, and later recounted to him as if it were fact, showing the effects of the rumor mill at work. Indeed, even people who were in the same city at the time were ready to believe that an earthquake accompanied his death, reminding us of the absurd miracles surrounding the death of Jesus recounted without a blush in Matthew 27:51-54. How easy it was for such stories to be believed! Even if this tale is filled with rhetoric on the part of Lucian, his criticism of gullibility would have no weight if it did not ring true.\nPeregrinus also had a small cult following after his death. His staff was treated as a religious relic (Lucian, The Ignorant Book Collector 14), his disciples preached his doctrine (Lucian, Runaways), and his statue healed the sick and gave oracles (Athenagoras, cited above). But his bid for religious glory was not as successful as another man, Alexander of Abonuteichos. Lucian dedicates an even longer and more vicious account of his personal contacts with this man, whom he calls \"the quack prophet.\" The account alone is detailed and entertaining, but for our present purpose it illustrates how easy it was to invent a god and watch the masses scurry to worship it. His scam began around 150 A.D. and lasted well beyond his death in 170 A.D., drawing the patronage of emperors and provincial governors as well as the commons. His cult may have even lasted into the 4th century, although the evidence is unclear.\nThe official story was that a snake-god with a human head was born as an incarnation of Asclepius, and Alexander was his keeper and intermediary. With this arrangement Alexander gave oracles, offered intercessory prayers, and even began his own mystery religion. Lucian tells us the inside story. Glycon was in fact a trained snake with a puppet head, and all the miracles surrounding him were either tall tales or the ingenious tricks of Alexander himself. But what might we think had there been no Lucian to tell us this? So credulous was the public as well as the government, that a petition to change the name of the town where the god lived, and to strike a special coin in his honor (Lucian, Alexander 58), was heeded, and we have direct confirmation of both facts: such coins have been found, dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius and continuing up into the 3rd century, bearing the unique image of a human-headed snake god. Likewise, the town of Abonuteichos was petitioned to be renamed Ionopolis, and the town is today known as Ineboli, a clear derivation. Even statues, inscriptions, and other carvings survive, attesting to this Alexander and his god Glycon and their ensuing cult (Culture and Society in Lucian, pp. 138, 143).\nAs for his influence, Lucian tells us that Severianus, the governor of Cappadocia, was killed in Armenia because he believed an oracle of Alexander's (27), and Rutilianus, the governor of Moesia and Asia, was also a devout follower, and even married Alexander's daughter. Indeed, Alexander's \"god\" was so popular that people rushed all the way from Rome to consult him (30), and even the emperor Marcus Aurelius sought his prophecy (48). From this it is all the more apparent that religious crazes were a dime a dozen in the time and place of the Gospels, helping to explain why a new and strange religion like Christianity could become so popular, and its claims--which to us sound absurd--could be so readily believed.\nThe final lesson from the case of Alexander and Peregrinus is that Lucian's skeptical debunking never persuaded any believers, showing that even the rare skeptic, no matter how convincing his arguments and evidence, could have no practical effect on the credulous. The vast majority would never read or hear anything he wrote, and most of those who did would dismiss it. Indeed, believers were hostile to critical thought and would shout the skeptics down and drive off even suspected doubters in their midst, as actually happened in the case of Alexander: before every ceremony, the congregation would cry \"Away with the Epicureans! Away with the Christians!\" (and atheists and unbelievers in general: 38) since these two groups had a reputation for trying to debunk popular religion (this hostility could even come to slander and violence: 25). In effect, this was like clamping their hands over their ears and humming, deliberately refusing even to hear reasonable arguments, much less to consider their force.\nFrom all of this one thing should be apparent: the age of Jesus was not an age of critical reflection and remarkable religious acumen. It was an era filled with con artists, gullible believers, martyrs without a cause, and reputed miracles of every variety. In light of this picture, the tales of the Gospels do not seem very remarkable. Even if they were false in every detail, there is no evidence that they would have been disbelieved or rejected as absurd by many people, who at the time had little in the way of education or critical thinking skills. They had no newspapers, telephones, photographs, or public documents to consult to check a story. If they were not a witness, all they had was a man's word. And even if they were a witness, the tales above tell us that even then their skills of critical reflection were lacking. Certainly, this age did not lack keen and educated skeptics--it is not that there were no skilled and skeptical observers. There were. Rather, the shouts of the credulous rabble overpowered their voice and seized the world from them, boldly leading them all into the darkness of a thousand years of chaos. Perhaps we should not repeat the same mistake. After all, the wise learn from history. The fool ignores it.\nGlenn Miller has written a rebuttal to this essay (\"Were the Miracles of Jesus invented by the Disciples/Evangelists?\" 2002), in response to which I changed some of the language above so as not to give a mistaken impression of my meaning. Miller's title has little to do with my essay, since I am not arguing here (even if I do elsewhere) that anyone in particular \"invented\" the miracles of Jesus. Rather, I am merely presenting a survey of the social and intellectual context in which those miracles came to be believed.\nAs to the remainder of Miller's criticism of this essay specifically, I plan to respond in a future rebuttal (which will be announced here). But one simple point must be made even now: almost all of Miller's relevant evidence comes from the educated or even scholarly elite (like Lucian), and thus in no way represents the average man or woman in antiquity, who by their very circumstance wrote nothing for Miller to examine. I would guess that skilled skeptics and skeptical viewpoints like those Miller finds probably could not be found in much more than 10% of the population of the time, if even that--but whose existence I acknowledged even in the original draft of this essay.\nThe fact that pagan miracle working is not much heard of today is in large part due to the more effective Christian propaganda during the Empire and, of course, a thousand years of censorship afterward. An excellent discussion of the former, and how it contributed to the eventual success of the Church, is given by Thomas Matthews in The Clash of the Gods: A Reinterpretation of Christian Art (1993). For a broad comparative study of holy men of all faiths (Christian, pagan, and Jewish) in the time of Jesus, an excellent source is Sage, Saint, and Sophist: Holy Men and their Associates in the Early Roman Empire, by Graham Anderson (1994). Both are highly recommended.\nThe most extensive study on the historicity of Apollonius as well as his cult and legend can be found in the otherwise dry work by Maria Dzielska, Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, translated by Piotr Pienkowski (L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1986). Interested scholars should begin there. In particular, the source tradition on his magic \"talismans\" is a complicated affair, but their history and reluctant acceptance by the Church is discussed at great length by Dzielska in chapter 3. As for Lucian, his works about Peregrinus and Alexander are available in a very readable and engaging English translation in Lionel Casson's Selected Satires of Lucian (1962). These two stories are a very fun read, and well worth seeking out. An excellent survey and analysis of Lucian's works and his surrounding culture is available in Culture and Society in Lucian by C. P. Jones (1986). This is, in fact, a must-read for anyone interested in the contrast between free thought and gullibility in the Roman Empire. It has entire chapters dedicated to Peregrinus and Alexander. Finally, Lucian's Philopseudes (or \"Lover of Lies\") is a virtual treasure trove of examples of ancient credulity and superstition that is a must-read source on the subject (it can be found in vol. 3 of Lucian's works in the Loeb Classical Library).",

When planning your retirement options, we want to make sure we offer a variety of plans.\nWe are part of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). Instead of participating in Social Security, CalOptima employees contribute a percentage of their pre-tax earnings to their CalPERS account. CalOptima contributes the same percentage of the employee\u2019s regular earnings into this account. This is a defined benefit retirement plan in which the retirement benefit is based on the employee's years of service, final/highest compensation, and age at retirement. Regular, full-time employees become vested in the plan after five years of service.\nWe also offer a Defined Contribution Supplemental Retirement Plan through the Public Agency Retirement System (PARS), a 401(a) tax-qualified multiple employer trust. CalOptima contributes to this on each employee\u2019s behalf. All contributions are automatically invested in a life-cycle mutual fund based on your current age and is managed by John Hancock Retirement Services. These life-cycle funds are professionally managed investments that automatically adjust to become more conservative over time as you approach your retirement date. If you wish to manage your own investments, you have the ability to select among 20 different mutual funds representing different investment sectors.\nA voluntary 457 Deferred Compensation Plan is also offered. Section 457 plans are available to public agencies and are similar to 401(k) plans in the private sector. The employee determines the amount of pay they wish to contribute, via payroll deductions, on a pre-tax basis. The employee determines from a selection of options how their money will be invested. The plan is portable, so it may be \u201crolled over\u201d to most other retirement plans.",

    "text": "This DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation) and after correction for difference in exposure conditions and between respiratory rates under standard conditions and under conditions of light activity (1/0.38 m3/kg x 7d/5d x 6.7 m3/10 m3).\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal) and after correction for difference in absorption and in exposure conditions (50%/5% x 7d/5d). The oral and dermal absorptions are estimated to be 50 and 5% respectively.\nOccupational exposure limits (8-h time weighted average) of 10 ppm (49 mg/m3) have been adopted in Austria and Germany (DFG) or of 25 ppm (125 mg/m3) in Belgium, Denmark and Great Britain. Short-term OEL of 10 ppm is in force in Austria, of 20 ppm in Germany (DFG) and of 25 ppm in Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden and UK.\n\u201cCarcinogenicity studies with hexylene glycol are not available. However, the genotoxicity studies provide no evidence of a carcinogenic potential. In animal studies of limited validity, 40 mg/kg body weight and day was found to be the NOEL for systemic toxicity after oral administration of the substance. The critical effect of hexylene glycol, however, is the eye irritation, which was observed in animals treated with the undiluted substance. Hexylene glycol does not seem to be a very powerful eye irritant as 25 % solutions were not irritating. In an early study, eye irritation developed in most of the 12 male and female test persons exposed for 15 minutes to hexylene glycol vapour in a concentration of 50 ppm (approximately equivalent to the saturation concentration at 25\u00b0C). No NOEL was determined in this study. The eye irritation seems not to have been very severe, a fact which is also suggested by the steepness of the dose-response curve seen in the Draize test data. The MAK value was established provisionally at 10 ml/m3. Because the eye irritation was not severe, for the restriction of exposure peaks hexylene glycol was classified in Peak limitation category I with an excursion factor of 2. Then, even during the permissible peak concentrations up to 20 ml/m3, no marked irritation is expected. Because of the lack of adequate data for the irritant potential of hexylene glycol, the MAK value must be considered provisional and requires confirmation in further studies. Assuming that 100 % of the inhaled substance is absorbed, exposure to concentrations in the range of the MAK value could result in a daily dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight which is still below the NOEL determined in animal studies with oral administration, assuming 100 % absorption here too. As there are no reproductive toxicity studies, hexylene glycol is listed in Section II of the List of MAK and BAT Values. The sensitizing potential is low and so the substance is not designated with an \"Sh\". The solubility of the substance suggests that it would be readily absorbed through the skin, but as the toxicity after repeated dermal application to experimental animals is low, the substance is not designated with an \"H\"\u201d.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation x 1/1.15 m3/kg). The absorption by inhalation is expected to be of the same order than the absorption by oral route.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal, x 50%/5%).

Because I am often recognized at the stores, people always ask me questions. I am more than happy to help. However, when I have to tell someone their doing something \"Wrong\" I feel bad. I had to deal with that yesterday.\nFirst of all, I was asked if there was a way to read the coupon bar code to see if they can use it on other products than what it was intended for. I answered \"No, I don't teach that practice\". Then I was informed that a customer in the store told them about it and was doing it regularly. I was a little upset about this. Practices like that is the reason stores are tightening up their coupon policies and making it harder for us to get great deals.\nSimply put, it is deciphering the bar code on a coupon to see if it will work on different (preferably less expensive) items.\nLook at coupon barcode decoding this way: It is like using counterfeit money to pay for your purchase! Although the cashier may not notice you are paying with a counterfeit bill, it will eventually reveal itself and the store looses out. A coupon is a form of payment and by not getting what the coupon says it is for is the same as paying with counterfeit money.\nSo, please read your coupons, get exactly what it says it is for and follow the parameters given by the coupon. Please don't use the barcode to determine what you can get because you know the register won't beep. Just because the register does not beep, does not mean that it is OK.\nThere are plenty of other websites and blogs that teach this practice and believe that it is OK. Please Be Aware! They believe they are right and have no problem teaching others to do the same. Taking advantage of a glitch in the bar code to get around the text of the coupon is fraud.",

    "text": "When it comes to determining total cost of ownership (TCO), it is vital for organisations to be able to place a single value on the complete lifecycle of a capital purchase. In the retail space, this means implementing a robust and repeatable system that enables the business to calculate the TCO of its IT, Logistics and Property investments.\nAs one of South Africa\u2019s largest retailers, the Foschini Group (TFG) found that the size and complexity of its businesses required a particularly robust, granular model to charge back the shared service costs for its various brands.\nThe Foschini Group currently offers an impressive portfolio of 28 retail brands covering clothing and footwear (including brands such as Foschini, Markham, Exact and Due South), jewellery (Sterns, American Swiss, Mat &May), sportswear (Sportscene, and Totalsports) and homeware (@home, @homelivingspace) and retails through over 2 600 stores across sub-Saharan Africa.\nIt was essential for TFG to gain visibility into a more accurate return on capital employed (ROCE) per brand, such as determining Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) after shared services cost allocations for each of the 28 brands, rather than relying on this metric at a consolidated Group level alone, explains Marlize van der Westhuizen, Head of Finance: Infotec and Logistics Divisions at TFG.\n\u201cSince TFG had no real cost transparency solution and a very limited charge-back model to its various brands, the group clearly required not only the right solution, but also the relevant expertise to introduce an effective cost transparency discipline into the enterprise. For this, we turned to Magic Orange, which was able to assist us with both consulting services and the actual implementation of the chosen solution,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe first requirement was to create a complete product and service catalogue, which the Magic Orange team assisted to build from scratch, based on relevant business input from the various areas in scope. Furthermore, the existing models for the allocation of costs were very limited and not consistently based on operational drivers. This meant that every product and service required a driver to be sourced and incorporated into the Magic Orange model. In addition to the development of these drivers, the implementation included training ensuring employees understood both the nature and fairness of the drivers.,\u201d explains Malcolm Stewart, Business Development Manager at Magic Orange.\n\u201cThe first phase focused on the customer\u2019s IT and Logistics budget stack \u2013 an individual stack that nonetheless had a substantial budget. This core model was delivered in a mere eight weeks, despite being driven from a zero base,\u201d Stewart states.\nVan der Westhuizen adds that reciprocal charging was properly modelled and catered for, and fully loaded and accurate TCOs for products and services across the organisation were also made available. Finally, scenario modelling was also implemented, which enabled multiple scenarios, including a range of different budgets, actuals and forecast data, to be loaded. This will assist TFG in making both strategic and tactical decisions.\n\u201cIn the end though, the two biggest game changers for us were the manner in which Magic Orange brought together the cost transparency and a credible recharge model based on consumption of services opposed to just a cost allocation model. This will further assist us in optimizing costs and an important step to calculate ROCE at a brand level. The Magic Orange team fully delivered on our challenges and exceeded our expectation in the way their experts understand and care for our business success,\u201d concludes van der Westhuizen.",

    "text": "Utility relocation that has been going on in Asheville\u2019s River Arts District is being done in coordination with the City\u2019s River Arts District Transportation Improvement Project (RADTIP).\nWhen it comes to regional utility and communications firms, Asheville\u2019s Public Works and Water Resources departments take a collaborative approach to the growth going in in Asheville.\nEvery six weeks, representatives from Duke Energy, NCDOT, PSNC, AT&T and the Metropolitan Sewerage District gather in the Public Works\u2019 first floor conference room for the Infrastracture Task Force, where they trade information about upcoming projects with an ear toward efficiency opportunities.\nAround the table, people talk how to do better project coordination and public notification.\nPublic Works developed a map that lists projects. The department then made that map available to these partner organizations.\nThat keeps crews from having to tear up the same portion of road two years in a row.\nProjects that have benefited have included the River Arts District Transportation Improvement Project (RADTIP), the Cedar Street Bridge repair in east Asheville, annual road resurfacing and the Hendersonville sidewalk project.\n\u201cEconomies of scale have been realized and maybe we can partner on who pays for resurfacing,\u201d said Shuler.\nWith the bond projects over the next seven years, coordination is going to be even more critical. At the same time, Mission Hospitals have their towers under construction, and A-B Tech continues its growth, having just finished a building that incorporated new sidewalks.\nSo far, utility relocation in the River Arts District for RADTIP has been the most visible coordination effort, with PSNC and Duke Energy as primary partners. Look for more collaboration as the Infrastracture Task Force continues its work.\nTo keep abreast of traffic delays due to construction, check out the Waze app, which contains official permitted City of Asheville lane and road closures. The City partnered with the traffic app through its Concerned Citizens Program so residents could get information about where to expect traffic delays, especially around RADTIP.",

    "text": "Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica (Acta) is an international journal that publishes articles within the fields of anaesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain, and emergency medicine. The journal is owned by the Scandinavian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI), and thereby also by the 5 Nordic national societies which make up the SSAI. Most of the submissions and articles are related to perioperative medicine, and each year we receive nearly 1000 manuscript submissions. The majority are from outside Scandinavia, and only around one-third of the printed articles are from Scandinavia. Last year we rejected more than 75% of all submitted manuscripts.\nMembers of the SSAI (and of the national societies of the 5 Nordic countries) recieve full text access to the journal (and potentially a print version, if allowed by the national society) as part of their SSAI membership. The journal is the flagship of the SSAI.\nManuscript handling is electronic, using ScholarOne, and all articles can be read or downloaded from the journal homepage, including the first articles from 1957 and those most recently accepted but not yet printed (Early View). The homepage also contains interesting lists of most accessed and most cited articles. Through simple choices in the personal user profile area for each SSAI member\u2019s Acta registration with the publisher, Wiley, the member can elect to receive regular notifications with full text links for the current issue table of contents, or for new articles being published digitally before coming into a print issue. Again, through simple logging in to the Acta Anaesth Scand journal website through Wiley, one can directly open any or all Acta journal articles in full text from anywhere.\nWe try to handle manuscript submissions as quickly as possible, and the average time from submission to first decision was approximately 35 days in 2015.\nTopical or narrative reviews, which are articles that systematically describe the current status a research field as an update for the general reader.\nExpert\u2019s opinions are articles that cover a specific clinical problem and contain recommendations for clinical practice.\nSystematic reviews and meta analyses that adhere to the required format for these highly focused articles.\nWe also publish articles on education as well as Ph.D.dissertation abstracts from Scandinavia.\nAuthors are encouraged to read our author guidelines carefully. Reports of randomised trials must conform to the CONSORT guidelines. For such studies, a flow diagram should be a part of the manuscript and a completed Consort Checklist must be submitted with the manuscript. For other types of studies, the CONSORT checklist is also very useful, for instance the focus on a specific primary hypothesis and one primary endpoint.\nFuture challenges are to obtain a better position on the journal ranking list in our field, but also to be more visible within intensive care medicine, pain, and emergency medicine.",

    "text": "L'Enfant Gallery at the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street NW.\nIn 2000, when Peter Colasante decided to move in, the once-elegant storefront on the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street, formerly an Italian men\u2019s shop, was boarded up. The art gallery he was relocating from Connecticut Avenue was named for architect and engineer Pierre Charles L\u2019Enfant (Colasante didn\u2019t consider the 1960s office complex\u2014L\u2019Enfant Plaza\u2014a fitting tribute to the designer of the District of Columbia).\nColasante, 67, is still pleased with his choice of location, calling Georgetown \u2014 outside of New York, which he says is \u201ca different universe\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe best place in the best city in the country to be.\u201d The gallery\u2019s window displays, meant to be \u201cvisual out-of-the-box experiences,\u201d draw in the avenue\u2019s enviable foot traffic. \u201cI find out who they are later,\u201d he says.\nBy now, the gallery has an international network of clients, a \u201cnuclear family.\u201d Dealers look to L\u2019Enfant Gallery for Chinese art and Asian ceramics, and the Civil War is a focus (Colasante lent items to a major Lincoln exhibition recently), but the overall mix is eclectic in genre, origin and price.\nStepping inside, visitors face a red wall of paintings hung salon-style, assorted chandeliers above. That sense of rich surprise extends throughout the gallery\u2019s four levels.\nIn November, after a volunteer archivist went through what was in storage, Colasante opened the gallery\u2019s basement to the public. It is now set up to resemble a Victorian viewing parlor, complete with a carved chief\u2019s throne from Borneo.\nHaving decamped for Vienna, Virginia, Colasante no longer gets up at 3 in the morning to move paintings around. But he and his business partner (and former spouse) Maureen Taylor rearrange the display and host special exhibitions every few months. From total holdings of roughly 4,000 objects, he says they sell 200 to 300 per year.\nColasante\u2019s eyes twinkle behind stylish frames when he recalls starting out with a much smaller inventory. In December of 1973, he opened Calvert Gallery in an English basement on Connecticut Avenue, putting four things purchased at apartment sales in the window. The gallery grew as it moved from one location to another in the vicinity of Connecticut and Calvert, becoming L\u2019Enfant Gallery in 1990.\nRaised in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, Colasante attended Catholic University, where he failed to shine, as he tells it, either as an actor or a philosopher. He learned about art working in Oxon Hill, Maryland, as an eccentric collector\u2019s cataloguer, then curator. His boss\u2019s advice: Never specialize.\nColasante can remember three recessions, but calls the last five years \u201cthe worst it\u2019s ever been.\u201d The threshold for bread-and-butter purchases, formerly $10,000, has dropped to $3,000, he says. The good news is that he owns his building, having finally been able to purchase it from a trust in 2012. He also does appraisal work and counsels owners of art and antiques (he advises those wishing to hang on to treasured possessions to avoid the three Ds: death, divorce and downsizing).",

    "text": "Ron Kroichick July 21, 2016 Updated: July 21, 2016 7:54 p.m.\nCurry offered a half-amused glare in return. That one hurt.\nBarely a month after his team fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, completing a shocking collapse from a 3-1 series lead, Curry made a very public appearance. He played 18 holes with four amateur partners in advance of this year\u2019s American Century Championship, the celebrity golf tournament starting Friday alongside Lake Tahoe.\nCurry invited The Chronicle to tag along and chat occasionally as he walked the emerald-green fairways on a breathtakingly gorgeous day.\nThree things became clear: The Finals loss still haunts him; he worried about needing surgery on his troublesome knee and ankle; and he\u2019s confident the Warriors will blend recently signed free agent Kevin Durant into the lineup, after a brief transition.\n\u201cI think about it all the time,\u201d Curry said of the Finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating feeling to not get the job done. But at the end of the day, for us to kind of keep that in our memory bank as we go forward will make us better.\nCurry looked spry as he smacked long tee shots around Edgewood, a picturesque tree-lined course. No limping, no hesitation, no sign of lingering trouble in the wake of knee and ankle injuries during the playoffs.\nMake no mistake: Those injuries limited his mobility in the Finals. That was plain to see. Curry lacked his customary explosiveness, and the Cavaliers \u2014 most notably Irving, their dynamic point guard \u2014 took full advantage. Irving scored 26 points in Game 7, including a key late three-pointer over Curry.\nCaddie Bryant Barr and Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry talk things over during the 2016 American Century Celebrity-Amateur Tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, California, on Thurs. July 22, 2016. His caddie Bryant Barr, (right) was his roommate back in their college days at Davidson.\nTo his credit, Curry didn\u2019t use the injuries as an excuse. He didn\u2019t Thursday, either, but he acknowledged fearing he might need surgery after the Finals. That\u2019s the main reason he reluctantly skipped joining the U.S. Olympic team as it prepares for next month\u2019s Summer Games in Brazil.\nThursday\u2019s outing represented the first time Curry offered his take on Durant\u2019s rock-the-league decision to join the Warriors. Curry was part of the recruiting delegation to visit Durant in the Hamptons, hoping to persuade the sought-after free agent from Oklahoma City to sign with Golden State.\nGolden State Warriors' Stephen Curry signs autographs during the 2016 American Century Celebrity-Amateur Tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, California, on Thurs. July 22, 2016.\nA few days later, on the morning of July 4, Curry woke up on vacation in Hawaii to discover his phone lighting up. Durant had left a voice mail. Draymond Green and other teammates had sent text messages.\nBut the first text Curry opened was from Warriors owner Joe Lacob. Curry figured Lacob was offering consolation, but then he read the message and realized Durant was now his teammate.\nThe weirdness will morph into a tantalizing challenge come training camp, as the Warriors try to spread shots among Curry, Durant and Klay Thompson. And maybe a few for Green, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a transition,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say guys will have to sacrifice \u2014 I want guys to be who they are, because that\u2019s what makes us so powerful. But there\u2019s a transition in how we see the game, how we see the floor, how the flow goes.\nBefore the Warriors embark on that quest, Curry waded into his new reality at Edgewood. The last time he played in this tournament, in 2013, he was not yet a two-time Most Valuable Player. The Warriors had not yet won the NBA title.\nCurry was popular, but he wasn\u2019t quite Steph Curry.\nSo the person with the biggest job Thursday probably was Ralph Walker, the retired Oakland police officer who serves as Curry\u2019s personal chief of security. Curry patiently signed hundreds and hundreds of autographs, while Walker helped him make his way between holes.\nThe circus was on full display. Several young women screamed in unison on No. 9, asking Curry to pose for a photo. He cleverly stopped, shouted \u201cPhotobomb!\u201d and spread his arms wide with a big smile, appearing in the background of their shot.\nLater, fans on the beach alongside No. 17 threw a football, Frisbee and Warriors hat for Curry to sign. He complied on all three counts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of chaotic, man,\u201d he said.\nAnd, no, it wasn\u2019t nearly as chaotic three years ago in Tahoe. Back then, Curry and a small group of family and friends went out for pizza and a movie to celebrate daughter Riley\u2019s first birthday. Few people bothered them.\nWednesday night\u2019s scene provided a striking contrast. Curry, his dad, Dell, caddie/college roommate Bryant Barr and Walker stopped at Safeway on the way back to their rental house.",

    "text": "\u2022 Fresh Dog \u2122 Dry Shampoo: If you\u2019ve ever used a dry shampoo on your own hair, you know it works by absorbing the oil and dirt from your scalp, leaving your hair looking like it\u2019s just been washed. Fresh Dog's dry shampoo does basically the same thing for your dog. It is a loose powder that you sprinkle directly onto your dog's coat for an instantly clean and freshen appearance.\nWhen applying the product, I found it best to sprinkle a small amount at a time, as using too much at once can cause a cloud of powder. I started at the base of the neck, sprinkling a bit of powder and massaging it in. I continued adding a bit more powder as needed, working my way down the back. A little powder goes a long way and my Schnauzer really enjoyed the massage. Note: I did not apply any product to the face, just to the body and legs.\nWhen I finished applying the product to the areas I wanted to cover, I took a soft bristle brush and brushed my dog out. This helped to distribute the powder even further and removed the excess along with small bits of dirt.\nI actually applied the powder to my dog while in the backyard. Since it was my first time trying out this type of product, I wasn\u2019t sure if the process would be messy or not. It wasn\u2019t. I did notice that my dog\u2019s coat appeared whiter, so dogs with a black coat might need a bit more brushing.\nThe dry shampoo powder is easy-to-use and smells, well\u2026 fresh! The powder is infused with essential oils and has a marvelous lavender rosemary scent. I even deodorized my Schnauzer\u2019s dog bed by sprinkling some onto it, too. It just smells so good. The dry shampoo powder is a good product to use as a quick way to remove odors and freshen up your dog's coat.\n\u2022 Fresh Dog \u2122 Waterless Foam Bath: If your Schnauzer is in need of a bath but you just don\u2019t have the time to do it, this waterless bath foam will solve your problem. Why it\u2019s a bath in a bottle and no water needed!\nJust dispense a few pumps of foam in the palm of your hand and distribute over your dog, taking special care not to get any into the eyes. Massage the foam fully into your dog's coat to loosen and break away any dirt and oils. Then towel dry your dog off... That's It!\nMy Schnauzer did not object to the foam bath at all and in fact, pranced around like \"I got it going on\" when we were done. I think he was just as happy as I was that he was clean and smelling fresh.\nI really like this product. There was no sticky residue and it smells great. I've tried squirt-on waterless shampoos before, but this foam bath is way better. The foam is thicker and richer and distributes the cleaning agent much more effectively, so you end up using less of it.\nnote: Although it is a waterless shampoo, the foam itself does dampen your dog's coat, but you do not need to rinse it out. Just allow the product to do its magic.\nOnce you towel dry your dog, it dries quickly and leaves the coat super soft and smelling great! I loved it!\nYour dog hates regular baths but could really use one about now.\nYour dog has been sick or is recovering from surgery and could use some spot cleaning.\nYou have an older or arthritic dog that has a hard time getting in and out of the tub.\nYou have company coming over and just no time to give your dog(s) a regular bath.\nYou have a multi-dog household and regular bath day becomes an all day job that's a nightmare.\nIt's great for cleaning dogs during those cold winter months.\nIt's a great product to carry along on trips or outings, just in case your dog gets into a smelly situation.\nIt's safe for dogs and puppies over 6 weeks of age.\nFor those who normally bathe their dogs at home: This no mess, no fuss, no back-breaking foam bath is easy to do and allows you to put off having to give your dog the traditional bath so often.\nFor those who usually take their dog to a groomer: Extends the time in-between regular visits to the dog groomer, thereby saving you time and money $$.\nSo for a great alternative to regular shampoos and the dreaded task of giving your dog a bath, try Fresh Dog \u2122! It will leave your dog's coat smelling fresh and clean.\nHow would you like to try out Fresh Dog on your Miniature Schnauzer... for FREE?\nThanks to the good folks at Fresh Dog, one lucky winner will win the set of shampoos to freshen up their own dog(s).\nPrizes: The Happy Dog Bundle - Both innovative dog shampoo products which include (1) 12oz dry shampoo powder and (1) 6oz bottle of the waterless bath foam. A $27 value.\nJust post a comment below, like: I want a Fresh Dog!\nA winner will be chosen at random from those who post a comment below on Friday May 18, 2012. So post a comment and Good Luck!\nAnd the winner is....... Fern Williams!\nAn easy-to-use deodorizing powder for dogs that extends time between regular washings. No water needed.\nWhy it's a dog bath in a bottle - No water needed! No sticky residue, repels dirt, and dries quickly.",

Los Angeles Air Force Base houses and supports the headquarters of the Air Force Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC). The center manages research, development and acquisition of military space systems. The 61st Air Base Wing provides support functions for the base.\nIn 1961, the Air Force developed a plan to consolidate its Space Systems Division and the Research and Development (R&D) Center of The Aerospace Corporation, which had been created in 1960 to support Air Force space programs. The plan involved acquisition of two pieces of real estate adjoining the R&D Center. An aircraft plant owned by the Navy at the northwest corner of Aviation and El Segundo Boulevards, was transferred to the Air Force in October 1962. Another site at the southwest corner of the same intersection, was owned by a mining company. The Aerospace Corporation acquired that site in November 1962 and built its new headquarters there between February 1963 and April 1964. By April 10, 1964, the Air Force property at the intersection of Aviation and El Segundo Boulevards was designated as Los Angeles Air Force Station, which was redesignated as Los Angeles Air Force Base in September 1987.\nIn 2006, Area A of LAAFB was permanently closed after a deal with a local builder to exchange the land in Area A for the creation of the Schriever Space Complex on Area B and other new facilities. In February 2007, a new base exchange opened up on Area B.\nThe portion of Fort MacArthur remaining in military use is a sub-base of Los Angeles Air Force Base serving as a housing and administrative annex. Fort MacArthur is in the San Pedro district of Los Angeles, approximately twenty miles south-east of Los Angeles Air Force Base.",

The group is arguing that IG\u2019s claims are unfounded and unfair and that the spread betting firm is guilty of systemic failures in its treatment of customers.\nIn particular, it contends that IG is in breach of its contractual obligations including the obligation to provide best execution and in its regulatory requirements under various Principles for Business and the specific rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Conducts of Business Sourcebook.\nHundreds of IG customers racked up losses of \u00a318.4 million after the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly removed its three-year EURCHF floor on 15 January, which caused severe distress in the market and resulted in some retail brokers going under. The Swiss franc surged by as much as 40% versus the euro within minutes of the central bank announcement.\nIG, which also suffered losses, has recouped some of the minimal sums outstanding from customers, but is in dispute with a group who account for a considerable share of the outstanding debts.\nNatalia Chumak, a partner at specialist litigation City firm Signature Litigation, who is representing the group in their complaint against IG to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), says that in justifying the claims against the group, IG heavily relies on its terms and conditions (T&Cs).\n\u201cHowever, analysis of IG\u2019s T&Cs, as well as the company\u2019s website and their behaviour on 15 January 2015, shows these claims to be groundless and unfair,\u201d she claims.\nSpeaking to Profit & Loss, Chumak argues IG must have been aware that the events that followed the SNB\u2019s decision to remove the floor was an \u201ceventual possibility\u201d.\nShe points to IG\u2019s decision in 2011, immediately after the floor was introduced by the central bank, to remove its offering of guaranteed stop orders in relation to EURCHF trades, indicating that IG knew that the events that occurred on 15 January could be a possibility.\n\u201cHowever, IG, appears to have done nothing in advance to prevent or mitigate the risks for their clients, and worse still, continued to offer aggressively leveraged trades inducing more clients to open accounts, and further, increasing the clients\u2019 exposure which IG could not manage,\u201d she says.\nChumak adds that the T&Cs effectively allow IG to work customers\u2019 positions however the company chooses, and claims that IG appears to have offloaded its own risks during the Swiss franc surge before starting to fill its customers\u2019 orders.\nShe says IG does not inform customers how it handles their trades, and still has not disclosed its full execution policy \u2013 something that the group contends is in violation of FCA rules.\n\u201cIt turns out that there is no limit to how much a customer can lose by trading with IG, but IG does not tell this to its customers clearly. IG can choose whether or not to take any risks, but will always take advantage of any upside,\u201d Chumak says.\nShe adds, \u201cMy clients\u2019 complaint is that IG has induced customers to open accounts with the company with misleading statements on their website and offers of low margins. IG withdrew or minimised its own risks long in advance of 15 January, without being transparent with its customers about the risks.\nThe group is presently pursuing a complaint with the FOS. Some customers have petitioned the FCA to investigate current practices in the sector. Chumak says the group of customers she is representing wants money that has been wiped off their accounts to be reinstated. They also want IG to drop its claim for the payment of significant negative balances.",

    "text": "Clemson, S.C.\u2014The Clemson women\u2019s golf team returns to the course for the second straight week at the sixth annual Allstate Sugar Bowl Invitational at English Turn in New Orleans, La. Clemson is one of 16 teams in the field that includes seven of the top 25 teams in the nation. The field includes four teams from the SEC, three from the ACC and Pac 12, one from the Big 10 and one from the Big 12.\nThis will be Clemson\u2019s sixth tournament of the year and second this spring. The Tigers have a 48-32-2 record against the field in the previous five events. Clemson returned Tuesday night from a 16th place finish at the Lady Puerto Rico Classic. J.T. Horton\u2019s team will take two freshmen, two juniors and a sophomore to this year\u2019s All-state Sugar Bowl Tournament.\nField: Alabama, Arizona, Clemson, Denver, Florida, LSU, Miami (FL), Michigan State, Mississippi State, Oklahoma State, Stanford, Texas, Tulane, UC Davis, UCF, UCLA, Virginia.\nFormat: Three 18-hole rounds each day Sunday through Tuesday, Feb. 21-23.\nClemson Lineup: Alice Hewson, Fr. (72.67); Lauren Stephenson, Fr. (73.33), Jessica Hoang, Jr. (75.92); Sloan Shanahan, Jr. (75.33); Marisa Messana, So. (76.56).\nTournament History: This will be Clemson\u2019s third appearance in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. The event was started by Clemson Head Coach J.T. Horton, who was the head coach at Tulane prior to coming to Clemson. Clemson finished fifth of 17 teams in 2014 and 14th of 15 teams last year. Sloan Shanahan, who will be in Clemson\u2019s lineup this weekend, finished sixth as a freshman at the Allstate Sugar Bowl with a 211 score, five-under-par. She had rounds of 71-70-70, the only time she has had three under-par rounds in the same tournament. Current junior Jessica Hoang had a 226 in the 2014 event and a 236 last year. She was Clemson\u2019s second best player last year. Messana was the top Clemson player in 2015 with a 235 score.\nClemson in 2015-16: Clemson has a 48-32-2 record against the field in its first six events. The fall was highlighted by a second-place finish at the Yale Women\u2019s Intercollegiate and a fifth-place at the Cougar Classic in Charleston. Clemson freshmen Alice Hewson and Lauren Stephenson have already combined for three victories. Hewson was co-medalist at the Cougar Classic and won the Lady Paladin Invitational, while Stephenson was co-medalist at Yale. Jessica Hoang and Lauren Stephenson were Clemson\u2019s top players last week in Puerto Rico. Hoang finished strong with scores of 72-73 in the last two rounds, while Stephenson had a 71 in the first round and was tied for sixth place. Both ladies finished 34th for the 54 holes with scores of 226.",

    "text": "Only within the last 16 months, the world has seen the emergence of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the Paris agreement which has just recently come into force, and the so called New Urban Agenda (NUA). All three of them represent bold and (more or less) legally binding agreements by the Member States of the United Nations. The New Urban Agenda should be the most concrete and practical one since it addresses the smaller scale of government, i.e. cities \u2013 the place where we will win or lose our struggle for a more just, equitable and indeed sustainable world.\nNovember 8, 2016 Comments Off on The New Urban Agenda: More Power to Cities? Yes, but how?\nOn September 22 2013, 50.9% of the Hamburg citizens voted in a referendum for the full remunicipalisation of the energy distribution grids in the city. The referendum was initiated by the citizen\u2019s initiative \u2018Our Hamburg \u2013 Our Grid\u2019 (OHOG) and constituted the climax of an intense political controversy that lasted for more than three years. Through this vote Hamburg has received international attention and became a flagship example for remarkable civil engagement. In the international best-seller \u201cThis Changes Everything\u201d (2014), Naomi Klein sees the driving motive in the people\u2019s \u2018desire for local power\u2019. Indeed it is true that under the constitution of the City of Hamburg, a successful referendum has a binding effect, which left the City government no other option than to announce the implementation of the referendum decision and to start the remunicipalisation process immediately after the vote. Now, three years after the referendum, it is time to evaluate what has been achieved so far. A series of interviews with key actors that were and, for the most part, still are involved in the remunicipalisation process shed some light on the remunicipalisation process and recent developments.\nIt is almost time. One of the most important international summits is on our doorstep. Next week the UN General Assembly will be gathering in Quito, Ecuador to (hopefully) agree and sign the so called New Urban Agenda, the international urban \u201cconstitution\u201d supposed to be guiding sustainable urban development in the next 20 years. Almost 40,000 participants from all around the world have registered. After the successful adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Paris agreement, expectations on the next UN cities summit are high. The question however is: will it deliver? Will delegates agree on a meaningful outcome that ultimately provides guidance for national and local governments? Will it keep up to the promise to be the \u201cSDG implementation summit\u201d? In fact, the goals and principles of the SDGs and the Paris agreement will be confronted with a reality check \u2013 since first and foremost much of their substance will have to be implemented by the cities of this world.\nOctober 13, 2016 Comments Off on Habitat III. The upcoming UN cities summit is as important as the Paris Climate Conference \u2013 but will it deliver?",

And it\u2019s amazing to think how relatively young this technology is, considering its extraordinary role in changing how the world communicates.\nWe put \u201cinternet\u201d in quotes because what many people think of as the internet actually refers to a few different things. Often, people confuse \u201cWi-Fi\u201d with the internet, although Wi-Fi refers only to an internet connection being broadcast over radio waves.\nAnother term that gets mixed up with internet is \u201cWorld Wide Web,\u201d but really the World Wide Web (aka \u201cThe Web\u201d) is a global information system that operates over the internet \u2013 much as email or Skype or Netflix do. What makes the Web so interesting and important is that it essentially made the internet a more user-friendly place where people could easily share ideas, photos, baby videos \u2013 you name it.\nSince August 1 is World Wide Web Day, we thought we\u2019d take note of some of the facts and history behind the Web.\nThe invention of the World Wide Web is credited to an English software engineer named Tim Berners-Lee. The son of parents who were among the very first computer scientists, Berners-Lee was working at CERN \u2014 a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland in the 1980s \u2014when he became frustrated by the fact that information on computers was hard to share. Plus, the information was often in different computer languages. There had to be a better way.\nIf all of that sound mostly like gobbledygook to you, that\u2019s OK. The point is, it worked, and worked so well that by the time the mid 1990s rolled around, businesses started to get the point that they needed to be on the World Wide Web just to compete. Everyone else soon followed.\nAdaptation to the Web was aided by the fact that CERN agreed to make the underlying code for the Web available without any royalty fees \u2014 essentially opening up the Web to anyone and everyone and fueling the rapid growth of the internet, the World Wide Web and just about anything else you can think of that requires an online connection.\nDespite the seeming ubiquity of internet access, there are still billions of people around the world who don\u2019t have a connection \u2014 reliable or otherwise. That need is what\u2019s driven Viasat to advance the availability of internet over satellite. Where cables and terrestrial wireless can\u2019t or won\u2019t go, satellite will, and it\u2019s increasingly clear that satellite will be the technology to take the Web to many of the places it couldn\u2019t go before.\nIf you want to know more about the World Wide Web, check out the book \u201cWeaving the Web\u201d by Berners-Lee himself.",

    "text": "\ufeffI want you to bookmark this blog post and pull it out on another day when you need encouragement in public speaking and persistence, because it is a tale that will make your speaking troubles look small.\nKevin O'Neal of The Indianapolis Star reported a remarkable story today about special education teacher Mary French, who got to give her high school valedictorian speech...this week, 42 years after her graduation from Arkansas's Foreman High School. French, who is black, attended the all-black half of the high school until the two merged during her years there. But when she graduated in 1968 with the highest grade-point average in the school, it was determined that she hadn't attended for all four years--since some of them were spent in the segregated side of Foreman, across town. A white girl in her class gave the valedictory address instead.\nOver the years, French has returned to Foreman -- a town of about 1,100 just a few miles from where Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas come together -- and each time, she has felt disappointment when walking past a display honoring the school's valedictorians. French, now 60, shared her story with her colleagues at Fall Creek Valley Middle School, a Northeastside school where she has taught special education for 20 years. \"We heard that story, and our jaws hit the floor,\" Kathy Luessow, principal at Fall Creek Valley Middle School, said Wednesday. \"We asked how that could happen, and she said that was a different time.\"\nWe know this is only the beginning of a long journey. We understand as we go to college, we still will be confronted with obstacles that will certainly deter us. But remember, all things are possible if we believe....Let's travel. Let's start our own businesses. Let's become teachers. Let's become lawyers, doctors or whatever we desire. We should commend ourselves that we can be whatever we want to be.\nYou can read the valedictory speech she wrote, in full, here. Yes, the words read poignantly today, in light of the story--her \"all things are possible if we believe\" theme turned out to be true. But more than that, this is an excellent valediction, with simple but stirring language, a hopeful view of the future, a focus on students and teachers, and fitting, rather than overdone, rhetorical flourishes.\nIf someone knows of video out there of this late-in-coming valediction, please leave a link to it in the comments. I'm so delighted to share this wonderful story with you, and welcome your reactions. Please do pass this on to a friend or colleague and share this inspiring tale.",

Using the presenter\u2019s 30 years of experience in medical social work, this presentation will review and explain some of the currently available technology in terms that can be used in discussions with non-medical individuals. We will use case examples as teaching tools to explore the moral, legal, ethical and religious implications related to these technologies with the goal of appreciating (if not necessarily agreeing with) varied beliefs and viewpoints.\nAbout Our Presenter: Dr. Bob Zylstra, EdD, LCSW, is Professor and Director of Behavioral Medicine at the UT College of Medicine Campus in Chattanooga and Adjunct Instructor for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga BSW program. As well as being an educator and practicing clinician, Dr. Zylstra serves on the medical ethics committees of Erlanger and Sisken Hospital. In addition to his involvement with family medicine, he has worked as a home health care social worker, supervisor of a community hospital\u2019s social work department, and business manager for an outpatient medical office. Dr. Zylstra grew up in Michigan where he earned his Master of Social Work degree from the University of Michigan. He earned his Doctorate degree in educational psychology from the University of Memphis, and continues his research and teaching interests in the areas of community medicine, mental health and geriatrics.",

The series of white LEDs are animated in a chase pattern. The project let [Robert] push his comfort boundaries by moving past a stock Arduino board.\nInside you\u2019ll find an ATtiny85. He picked up the chip to try running Arduino sketches on smaller hardware. But the total of five available I/O pins presented an issue with driving the LEDs. Ten LEDs are used here and even a standard multiplex display would need no less than seven to control them without additional chips or the need for Charlieplexing. His solution was to drive two opposite LEDs at once, which cuts the need down to his five available pins.\nOnce he got it all soldered together he realized that he had made a coding error. But a few soldered wires let him reflash it in place using ISP.",

Interviews of each woman's birth experience were transcribed and analyzed using Colaizzi's descriptive, phenomenological method.\nResults: The findings were clustered into five themes: preparing for childbirth, mistrust, feeling rushed, being fearful, and sacrificing.\nClinical implications: The results from this study contribute to the understanding of psychosocial stressors that are associated with childbirth complicated by unplanned cesarean birth. This study lends evidence to our practice by providing information about how important anticipatory guidance is for expectant women because the possibility of cesarean birth in today's environment is not remote. Discussions about unplanned cesarean births should also be a part of this anticipatory guidance.\nFries, Kathleen S. \"African American Women & Unplanned Cesarean Birth.\" MCN: The American Journal of Maternal Child Nursing. 35.2 (2010): 110-115.",

    "text": "New England is a geographical region which comprises six states of the northeastern United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.\nIt is bordered by the state of New York to the west and the south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south.\nThe puritan pilgrims from England first settled in the region in 1620, forming the Plymouth Colony, the first successful English settlement in the Americas. Ten years later, more Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in the greater Boston area, thus forming the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\nYou can take a virtual tour of the Mayflower ship, the first ship of the pilgrim in the video below. We take you inside the ship to show you how the early English immigrants lived, worked, slept, cooked and ate for months on a torturous and oftentimes dangerous ship journey.\nOver the next 126 years, people in the region fought in four French and Indian Wars, until the British and their Iroquois allies defeated the French and their Algonquin allies in North America.\nIn 1692, the town of Salem, Massachusetts and the surrounding areas experienced one of the most infamous cases of mass hysteria in the history of the Western Hemisphere, the Salem witch trials.\nIn the late 18th century, political leaders from the New England Colonies known as the Sons of Liberty initiated the resistance to Britain\u2019s efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists.\nThe Boston Tea Party was a protest to which Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government. These were termed the \u201cIntolerable Acts\u201d by the colonists.\nThe confrontation led to the first battles of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, and the expulsion of the British authorities from the region in the spring of 1776.\nThe region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery in the United States and was the first region of the U.S. transformed by the Industrial Revolution, centered on the Blackstone and Merrimack river valleys.\nThe physical geography of New England is diverse for such a small area. Southeastern New England is covered by a narrow coastal plain, while the western and northern regions are dominated by the rolling hills and worn-down peaks of the northern end of the Appalachian Mountains.\nWith the Atlantic fall line lying so close to the coast, numerous industrial cities were able to take advantage of water power along the numerous rivers, such as the Connecticut River, which bisects the region from north to south.\nThe region is particularly known for its beautiful fall foliage. Take a look at the beautiful New England scenery in the video below.\nEach state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities, which are known as towns. These are often governed by town meetings. The only unincorporated areas in the region exist in the sparsely populated northern regions of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\nIt maintains a strong sense of cultural identity, although the terms of this identity are often contrasted, combining Puritanism with liberalism, agrarian life with industry, and isolation with immigration.",

    "text": "My father in law Charlie was prescribed Clopidogrel on May 2, 2014.\nHe was in turn taken to Pittsburgh hospital in July 30, 2014 with bleeding on the brain, as diagnosed by a neurosurgeon. The doctor placed him in hospice because he could not fix the issue. Charlie died on February 13, 2015. The cause of death listed on his death certificate is subdural hemorrhage.\nThe only lawsuits I have seen relating to this issue are for Plavix, not Clopidogrel which is the generic brand. Are there any lawyers taking Clopidogrel lawsuits? What would I have to do to bring a case for this? Thank you.\nClopidogrel bisulfate, or its generic brand name Plavix, is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The drug was approved in 1997 for prevention of blood clots and to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\nWhile the manufacturer claimed Plavix worked better than aspirin, recent studies have shown that Plavix carries no significant benefit over the much cheaper aspirin.\nThere are currently several class actions in litigation. It appears they are not accepting victims in class actions against Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate.\nGo online and search on class actions for Clopidogrel bisulfate. You will find a good number of law firms representing victims of the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate in class actions and product liability claims. Feel free to contact those firms for further information.\nMy father passed away June 2016. A TIA incident brought us to our nearest hospital. There, the nurse recommended Plavix. Not even three months later he had a massive brain hemorrhage. He died from plavix being in his system before he passed away a week later.\nI read that if he took aspirin with it, which I believe he did for the headache, it increases the chance of bleeding even further. They never went over that, at least not with me in the room.\nThis stuff really shouldn\u2019t be on the market, it does not help anyone no mater how great the thought is. It\u2019s only a great way to kill your family. Hospitals have Total lack of understanding of the use of this drug. Do not take this stuff lightly.\nI don\u2019t know if I can sue them and the hospital since its been two/three years, but if its possible I will. Even if it doesn\u2019t bring back my dad. I want to fight them so at least he wouldn\u2019t have died in vain, for my family and for others.\nI had a heart attack in April 2017 and was put on a generic of Plavix. I was supposed to take it for a whole year but 2 months ago I got a letter in the mail stating the generic for Plavix (the pill I was taking) was on recall. Now I am looking for a lawyer to tell me what I should do because the whole time I was taking this medicine it wasn\u2019t helping me. I\u2019m still having trouble breathing and I have this rash all over my body. I don\u2019t know what to do but I\u2019m about to contact a lawyer.\nI am so sorry about your husband\u2019s death. Thank you very much for giving out this very important information about \u2018the court ruling\u2019. Only after I read your write up I understood why, not a single law firm is willing to go after these drug manufactures, and why they are dropping the cases.\nWith all the death and side effect incidents with this drug, FDA is claiming that \u2018enough\u2019 victims or doctors are not reporting the adverse effect to FDA so they could not recall it! The \u2018number of victims\u2019 report is their base for recall! Did you get a chance to report it to FDA? You could do it online FDA.GOV. Or call 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332) and speak to a person.\nMy husband was bruising all over his body, cardiologists said that is the side effect of clopidogrel and got a bleeding stroke in April of 2016, followed by seizures and complications from that. Fortunately, he is still alive, could not drive, quality of life completely changed, 72 year old need to be taken care of like a seven year old. Now that FDA has the authority over this drug, there is something we could do, thus our loss will not be in vein.\nWe need to write to the FDA administrator, with cc to the white house, the justice department who did the ruling, the house appropriation committee chair who is funding the FDA, the senators and the congressmen/women of our states. There are a lot of victims not able to do anything about it legally, however, collectively we could do a lot about it. If I could save one family from going through the suffering, I will be happy. Please communicate with me if you could.\nMy husband died as a result of taking Plavix following a TIA he had in January of 2012. For 6 months he took Plavix and when it came off patent in May, 2012 he was given the generic called Clopidogrel for 3 more years.\nMany of the side effects of Plavix, or the generic drug, presented in my husband, but were attributed to his existing disease, NASH \u2013 nonalcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.\nDuring the time he was on this medication he had nose bleeds, bleeding in his mouth, and constant bruising. When he had a cerebral hemorrhage and a gastro-intestinal bleed, doctors could not figure out what was happening.\nAfter his death in December of 2015, I proceeded to do some research on my own. Major side effects from these drugs are cerebral hemorrhages, gastro-intestinal bleeds, nose bleeds, gum bleeds, blood bruising and bone marrow disorder.\nIt was this last side effect that ultimately killed my husband. He developed a bone marrow disorder which led to AML leukemia. He died from this leukemia.\nIn my research I have read so many accounts of people who had been prescribed Plavix and were later diagnosed with AML leukemia. Obviously, not a coincidence. It would appear to be a direct result of taking these drugs.\nDue to the ruling by the Supreme Court Justices which stated that all generic drugs and their manufacturers, some 80% of all drugs consumed in the United States, are exempt from liability for side effects, mislabeling, or virtually any other negative reactions caused by their drugs.\nIn short, the Court ruled that the FDA has ultimate authority over pharmaceuticals in the US, and if the FDA says a drug is safe, that takes precedent over actual facts, real victims and any and all adverse reactions.\nIn other words, if the FDA says something is safe, it does not matter if that decision is wrong or the result of misrepresentation, fraud or deception on the part of the world\u2019s pharmaceutical companies.\nThere is no way to sue the FDA for being wrong and costing millions of unsuspecting Americans their lives. That result leaves millions of Americans unprotected from an industry responsible for innumerable preventable deaths in the US from use of these drugs and their side effects.\nMy husband died and there is no recourse. However, if he was holding a hot cup of coffee from McDonald\u2019s, we could have litigated this!\nPharmaceutical companies and our government, in the eyes of the Supreme Court, are putting profits before people. This decision has to be reversed.",

    "text": "A vicious crime against humanity was once again wrought yesterday, the first of its magnitude on American soil. Our fear and rage are both inevitable and understandable; and it is indeed vitally important that those who prepared and executed the crime be brought to justice as soon as possible in an international court of law.\nBut it is incumbent on every peace-loving American citizen to stand up against the strident calls for massive retaliation, even when they come from elected officials and even after the perpetrators have been identified beyond question. Ideologically inspired terrorism cannot be suppressed by conventional military means, and in particular not by raining fire on the civilian populations of countries whose governments are thought to harbor or sponsor terrorists.\nThe cause of terrorist acts such as these is not a collective madness, religious fanaticism or \"cowardice\", but cold rational reflection by small numbers of exceptionally aggrieved and alienated people who are driven to desperation by perceived chronic injustices to which they can see no peaceable solution.\nTo really put an end to such acts, in addition to finding, arresting, prosecuting and incarcerating such people, we have got to tighten our belts and open our minds and hearts.\nWe need to pay a whole lot more attention to the terrible things that are happening day by day to people around the world than we have been in the habit of doing up to now; and we must join more wholeheartedly in the world-wide effort to eliminate human suffering and inequity, and broaden the realm of justice.\nThat is the work of spiritually centered thinkers, social activists and statesmen. It is not the work of soldiers.",

    "text": "America\u2019s Best Colleges \u2013 Every single college in our country aspires to be in this list released every year by the US News and World Report. This ranking is by far one of the most authentic. What does the recently released college rankings show us about our education system?\nIf you first look at the drawbacks of this particular measuring system, you can see that the rankings are based more on the type and number of students admitted by the colleges rather than on the quality of education they impart.\nOver the past few years, there is a complete change of algorithm. All said and done, even today, these rankings are all about selectivity and prestige. So, what are the measures taken to compile the ranking?\nFor one, the magazine takes a faculty survey to determine academic reputation of colleges. Next, based on applicant percentage admitted into the college and their SAT scores, the magazine then determines the level of the institution\u2019s admissions selectivity. Other factors taken into account include graduation rates, admission and retention rates and financial resources.\nLogically it follows that if institutions want to climb the ranks, they must reject more applicants, increase SAT benchmarks and attract better students. In the process, most of them are forced to increase tuition too.\nPlaying the numbers game perfectly, many institutions recently have gained the status of high risers. For instance, the George Washington University, through the 2000s, was successful in lowering admission rates from 49 to 33 per cent, built posh dorms and jacked its tuition. These measures led the college to be ranked 54 this year from being unranked.\nToday, the University of Richmond is ranked 30 from being unranked in the national liberal arts ranking. This feat was achieved by the institution by lowering its admit rate to 31% from previous 48% and by increasing tuition rate by 31% in 2004-2005.\nAs compared to any other area where competition naturally benefits customers with companies vying with each other to offer many benefits and to attract more. In the field of higher education, sadly, competition means maximizing market share by serving only customers who can pay.\nColleges continue to build more amenities for students. This in turn leads to a situation where they restrict access based on choosing students who can pay for the said amenities. Colleges continue to remain selective especially after they start rising in rankings as naturally, they are in demand.\nIn the long run, families and students are the ones who lose. This is a game where colleges definitely prosper and many of them are also able to achieve their goal which by far is nothing more than rising in the US News rankings.\nSome of the smaller liberal arts colleges feature on top of the list which also ranked Harvard at 6th place. A depressing fact is that the 75 per cent bench mark was met only by 98 out of 3,100 four-year colleges in our country.\nOne of the biggest blunders we continue to commit here is to define best colleges based not on the quality of education they impart to students but solely on those that enrol the best students who can assure return-on-investment. The focus for good colleges should be not on rankings but on giving opportunities for 96% of our students who go elsewhere.",

    "text": "The Kearny Mesa Swimming Pool is now much more inviting for disabled visitors.\nCrews striped extra-wide parking spots to accommodate vans for the disabled, and a ramp was added for those who can\u2019t climb the stairs.\nLocker rooms have been gutted to widen restroom, shower and dressing stalls for wheelchair users. The outdoor shower area has been rebuilt to eliminate a step, and easy-to-turn handles will be installed on doors.\nThroughout San Diego, a growing number of public buildings and streets are getting retrofitted as the city steps up spending to tackle a backlog of projects to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSan Diego used to spend about $1.5 million a year on such projects. Now it\u2019s spending $10 million more per year on curb cuts, ramps, audible signals and detectable warning tiles at street intersections, among other improvements to remove barriers to access.\nMayor Jerry Sanders has committed to spending the additional $50 million over five years to improve access, in part by allocating proceeds from the sales of surplus city properties.\n\u201cBefore the mayor came into the office, we were just doing a trickle of projects. We are doing a lot of projects now,\u201d said David Jarrell, deputy chief operating officer for public works.\nAdvocates for the disabled said the improvements would help cut down the city\u2019s liability. Cities across the country have been sued for failure to improve access. San Diego was sued in 1997 by disabled residents who claimed they had been denied equal access to Qualcomm Stadium. The lawsuit was settled after the city agreed to spend $5.25 million to equip the stadium with new elevators, ramps, parking spaces and seating.\nBill Harris, a Sanders\u2019 spokesman, said the desire to do the right thing \u2013 not legal exposure \u2013 drove the mayor\u2019s commitment to ADA compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about avoiding litigation. It\u2019s about ensuring equal access,\u201d Harris said.\nAccording to the city, more than 500 curb ramps were installed in the past two years. About $19 million of projects are in design stages and an additional $4 million in jobs are under construction.\nFacilities being retrofitted range from police stations and recreation centers to branch libraries and teen centers.\nCindi Jones, director of the Center for an Accessible Society in San Diego, said improvements have been made, but the city still has a long way to go. She uses a scooter and her husband uses a wheelchair.\nIn South Park, where she and her husband have lived for 30 years, a curb cut was installed on their block about a year ago, Jones noted. She\u2019s looking forward to more curb cuts in her neighborhood.\nThe city\u2019s former disability services coordinator, Linda Woodbury, had said the city needed to spend $500 million on ADA compliance, but the mayor\u2019s office has disputed that figure. Woodbury was fired in 2006, a day after Sanders first proposed spending $50 million more on access projects. The city later settled a wrongful termination suit.\nLouis Frick, executive director of Access to Independence in San Diego, said the access features benefit society as a whole.\n\u201cYou see people all the time with baby strollers, delivery truck drivers, where they are using the curb cuts to get up and down the sidewalks,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "Two recently published reports shed damning light on the high cost of low wages in the fast food industry \u2013 an industry dominated by the restaurant giant McDonald\u2019s, which raked-in over $5.4 billion in profits last year.\nThe reports \u2013 Super Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry \u2013 argue that low-wages in the fast-food industry cost taxpayers nearly $7 billion annually.\nMedicaid and CHIP (the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program) account for more than half of the $7 billion, at an average of $3.9 billion annually. Additionally, due to low earnings, fast food workers\u2019 families also receive an annual average of $1.04 billion in food stamp benefits and $1.91 billion in Earned Income Tax Credit payments.\nThe ten largest fast-food companies alone made more than $7.4 billion in profits in 2012 and paid their top executives more than $53 million in compensation.\nLow-wage fast-food jobs cost tax-payers the most in California ($717 million), New York ($708 million), Texas ($556 million), Illinois ($368 million), and Florida ($348 million).\nAccording to Super Sizing Public Costs, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s represents the most costly fast-food company for tax-payers.\u201d Low wages and lack of benefits at McDonald\u2019s cost tax-payers \u201c$1.2 billion every year in public assistance programs,\u201d according to the report.\nYUM! Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC), Subway, Burger King and Wendy\u2019s round-out the top five fast-food companies with workers who rely on public assistance.\nThe median average wage for fast-food workers is $8.69; an estimated 87 percent of fast-food workers do not receive health benefits. Furthermore, 67 percent of front-line fast-food workers are adults 20 and older; 68 percent are the main earners in their families and more than one-quarter are raising children.\n\u201cThis business model puts tax-payers on the hook, while rewarding corporate CEO\u2019s,\u201d Jack Temple, a policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project and co-author of Super Sizing Public Costs, said during a conference call with the press on October 15.\nThe reports come on the heels of a nation-wide wave of fast-food worker strikes; most recently strikes took place in over 60 cities across the nation with thousands of fast-food workers walking off their jobs.\n\u201cThe CEO of McDonald\u2019s makes more in a day than I make in a year,\u201d Yates added.\nFast-food workers nationally are calling for $15 an-hour in pay and the right to form or join a union without retaliation.\nJacobs also addressed the wave of non-traditional worker organizing taking place in fast-food, retail and other low-wage service sector jobs.\nSuper Sizing Public Costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill was published by the National Employment Law Project and Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-Wage Jobs in the Fast-Food Industry was published by the University of California Labor Center.",

    "text": "I have it for more than half a year..simply can't live without it. Can't even imagine flying without it now. Drivers are getting better, does more fluent job. Now it remembers staying in absolute mode and I can safely shutdown Windows (XP SP1) without getting the trackir drivers stuck. Simply amazing!!!\nI've used it for 3 years now in sims. Still works as new.\nSoftware has been constantly improved and it gets better and better all the time.\nThe longer you have it the more you like it, I hated it at first but now I wont fly without it.\nYou just have to learn to use it,for example always sit the same distance from the Tir unit or the responce will vary greatly.And use lots of deadzone at first then slowly reduce it as your skills improve.\nBrought the 3D into flightsimming, that's for sure. Now I can look at my instruments, out the window, through my body by turning my head.\nIt's not like in real life, but it gets closer..\nI still use it from time to time.\nI find it of less value/use on non-full real.\nWhen I have the 'pit off or external views I find it disorienting, but that may be down to practice!\nAnd as I am having a major problem adjusting to the new FM's I don't have the time or patience to put into TIR in these circumstances!\nAnd the orientation is automatic because you always have feedback where you look, because you move your head in that direction. But if you're not used to it, it may take a bit of practice. It's not hard though.\nSo when i fly pit off, i only fly with just the gunsight as visual reference and never lose orientation. TrackIR is handy with all settings, medium easy or hard. It's just like using a joystick to fly when for years you've been using the arrow keys to fly. TrackIR is also the HOTAS (= hands OFF throttle and stick) to look around.\nSometimes i watch trk's in external view and recreate external padlock with the trackIR. Focusing on 1 plane while tracking the other(s) with it. You can do that all without pressing buttons. It's great. So people who think trackIR is only usefull in full real games haven't yet discovered the full capability of trackIR yet./i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif Because it's even better in medium or easy games.\nIt's getting better and better! No flying without it as far as I'm concerned.\nNew software (2.11) supports it in FS2004 as well. Go get it!\nI better stop being lazy and negotiate with my wife for some extra 'stick time'!\nYou can also look at the map while looking around the countryside to orient yourself looking for landmarks, rivers towns etc. And if you want, you can steer the view independantly of the gun if you want to play reargunner. In short, it was already good back then, it's great now, and it's getting better all the time.\nNew software/drivers is good too!\nCan't wait to fire it up again when I get home tonight!\n\"Sorry kids, Daddy is busy\"\nWhat is the price for TrackIr?\nIs it available in skandinavia?\nDNMY made a comment about the map and he(she?) was dead on. It's nice to be able to look around when the map is open. I can finally give up on the map navigation lines being on, padlock on, etc and now can fly effectively with 100% realism options on. I paid $119 usd with $19 shipping. I was especially glad to know you can use reflective tape and not have to depend on the manufacturer for those dots.\n- What is the price for TrackIr?\n- Is it available in skandinavia?\nThey have a European sales office, they sell TrackIR as well as 3D Glasses.",

    "text": "In response to the growing demand for skilled professionals in health professions, YouthBuild Just-A-Start has committee to broadening its horizons by providing new career training for healthcare related fields. Recently on Wednesday June 6, 2012 YouthBuild Just-A-Start was featured in a YouthBuild USA film screening, \"Building Career Opportunities in Healthcare\". The film captures current participants and alumni from YouthBuild Just-A-Start as they explore and pursue career pathways withing the health care industry. Developing pathways to health care related careers has been recognized by YouthBuild USA as a best practice for creating promising futures for our young people. While construction training remains a key component of YouthBuild programs, YouthBuild Just-A-Start remains open to an ever changing workforce environment. We are so proud of the YouthBuild Just-A-Start students and look forward to hearing about their future success. Please take a moment to view the short film below.\nAs the Massachusetts YouthBuild Coalition continues its mission to empower underserved young people through advocacy, resource development, peer evaluation, and support, the students and staff took some time to say thank you in appreciation of public officials who have provided both financial and moral support to YouthBuild programs over the past sixteen years. This was accomplished by landscaping the State House front lawn.\nOn Wednesday May 23rd, students and staff from six Massachusetts YouthBuild programs gathered to volunteer their service. This group committed to the landscaping project for the fourth consecutive year by planting red and white geranium flowers and impatiens. They also assisted with pruning of tree shrubs and bushes.\nDuring the lunch hour Congressman William Keating, came out to visit with the students. They had a chance to introduce themselves and inform Congressman Keating of what projects they have been working on. To wrap up the day, YouthBuild students made their way into the State House to meet with, among others, Senator Eileen Donoghue of Lowell who has been a strong supporter of YouthBuild.\nThis was a wonderful experience and there was a great turn out. Members of the State House staff were proud see young people and adult supervisors working together to take care of the property. The students proved that they were ready to be the difference by taking a step forward and making things happen. The work at the State house showed initiative and that our youth care. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "Where should routes be defined?\nBootPHP provides a very powerful routing system. In essence, routes provide an interface between the urls and your controllers and actions. With the correct routes you could make almost any url scheme correspond to almost any arrangement of controllers, and you could change one without impacting the other.\nAs mentioned in the Request Flow section, a request is handled by the Request class, which will look for a matching Route and load the appropriate controller to handle that request.\nIt is important to understand that routes are matched in the order they are added, and as soon as a URL matches a route, routing is essentially \"stopped\" and the remaining routes are never tried. Because the default route matches almost anything, including an empty url, new routes must be place before it.\nThe default route is simply provided as a sample, you can remove it and replace it with your own routes.\nSo this creates a route with the name default that will match urls in the format of (<controller>(/<action>(/<id>))).\nLet's take a closer look at each of the parameters of Route::set, which are `name`, `uri`, and an optional array `regex`.\nThe name of the route must be a unique string. If it is not it will overwrite the older route with the same name. The name is used for creating urls by reverse routing, or checking which route was matched.\nThe uri is a string that represents the format of urls that should be matched. The tokens surrounded with `<>` are keys and anything surrounded with `()` are optional parts of the uri. In BootPHP routes, any character is allowed and treated literally aside from `()<>`. The `/` has no meaning besides being a character that must match in the uri. Usually the `/` is used as a static seperator but as long as the regex makes sense, there are no restrictions to how you can format your routes.\nLets look at the default route again, the uri is `((/(/)))`. We have three keys or params: controller, action, and id. In this case, the entire uri is optional, so a blank uri would match and the default controller and action (set by defaults(), covered below) would be assumed resulting in the `Controller_Welcome` class being loaded and the `action_index` method being called to handle the request.\nController - The controller that the request should execute.\nAction - The action method to call.\nThe BootPHP route system uses perl compatible regular expressions in its matching process. By default each key (surrounded by `<>`) will match `[^/.,;?\\n]++` (or in english: anything that is not a slash, period, comma, semicolon, question mark, or newline). You can define your own patterns for each key by passing an associative array of keys and patterns as an additional third argument to Route::set.\nIn this example, we have controllers in two directories, admin and affiliate. Because this route will only match urls that begin with admin or affiliate, the default route would still work for controllers in classes/controller.\nYou can also use a less restrictive regex to match unlimited parameters, or to ignore overflow in a route. In this example, the url foobar/baz/and-anything/else_that/is-on-the/url would be routed to Controller_Foobar::action_baz() and the \"stuff\" parameter would be \"and-anything/else_that/is-on-the/url\". If you wanted to use this for unlimited parameters, you could explode it, or you just ignore the overflow.\nIf a key in a route is optional (or not present in the route), you can provide a default value for that key by passing an associated array of keys and default values to Route::defaults, chained after your Route::set. This can be useful to provide a default controller or action for your site, among other things.\nThe `controller` and `action` key must always have a value, so they either need to be required in your route (not inside of parentheses) or have a default value provided.\nIn the default route, all the keys are optional, and the controller and action are given a default. If we called an empty url, the defaults would fill in and `Controller_Welcome::action_index()` would be called. If we called `foobar` then only the default for action would be used, so it would call `Controller_Foobar::action_index()` and finally, if we called `foobar/baz` then neither default would be used and `Controller_Foobar::action_baz()` would be called.\nYou can also use defaults to set a key that isn't in the route at all.\nAs you can see in the below route, the reverse uri parameter might not make sense.\n* You don't like slashes?\nThe Request::param method takes an optional second argument to specify a default return value in case the key is not set by the route. If no arguments are given, all keys are returned as an associative array. In addition, `action`, `controller` and `directory` are not accessible via Request::param().\nIf a url matches the route, then `Controller_Ads::index()` will be called. You can access the parameters by using the `param()` method of the controller's Request. Remember to define a default value (via the second, optional parameter of Request::param) if you didn't in `->defaults()`.\nThe established convention is to either place your custom routes in the `MODPATH//init.php` file of your module if the routes belong to a module, or simply insert them into the `APPPATH/bootstrap.php` file (be sure to put them above the default route) if they are specific to the application. Of course, nothing stops you from including them from an external file, or even generating them dynamically.\nLet's say you decided later to make that route definition more verbose by changing it to `feeds/<user_id>(/).`. If you wrote your code with the above uri generation method you wouldn't have to change a single line! When a part of the uri is enclosed in parentheses and specifies a key for which there in no value provided for uri generation and no default value specified in the route, then that part will be removed from the uri. An example of this is the `(/)` part of the default route; this will not be included in the generated uri if an id is not provided.",

Oh my, I found my new preamp. This thing sounds Killer and very clear and natural. Not eq-ed and all colored up like most preamps on the market!!!! Very cool with the tone knob punched out you get the instrument direct with a wonderful smoothness and a volume control on the U5. It also has an engage button for the 6-position eq setting which is wonderful!!! I hat all the parametric color your sound crap. Why buy a wonderful and expensive instrument to never hear it. Ok anyway, I have been so happy with this thing that I had to come and post a thread to see who all is using or has used these and do you use it for an actual preamp?\nI have used it as a preamp before(though I have never actually owned it). It is killer! Easily the clearest and warmest sounding preamp I have played through. If I don't end up buying an iAMP head, I am going to go preamp power amp with the U5.\nIts awesome and so pure!\nAnyway, I'm working a few other avenues. They sound killer. I just need to get the rack ear's so I can install it in a rack with the Crest LT series which is a wonderful musical amp in it self!\nBrian, Just sell that Chamber fretless Benavente for $10,000 and you are all set for the avalon. I got my U5 coming next week...will let u know about the sweet sounds with all my Benaventes!!!\nI used mine to go direct into the PA at a gig last weekend. Sounded great. Clean and pure. Mighty fine gear.\nI have one. Very nice.\nI bought it for the times that they tell you there is a backline and you show up, with no amp, and the backline is the PA.\nYou DON'T always want some soundmen to have complete control over your sound. I have mine in a little padded Gator bag that was for microphones. I just trimmed away the foam and it fits perfect.",

    "text": "Mac McCorkle runs a bar and helps out his partner, who is a agent with the CIA.\nWhen McCorkle took his life savings and began to open a small pub in Bonn, Germany, after being discharged from the army, he wasn't looking for a partner. That didn't stop Mike Padillo from dropping in, handing him a check for half the value of the place, and telling Mac he could either accept the offer or see the opening delayed forever in red tape.\nKnowing he really had no choice, McCorkle accepted gracefully, albeit unhappily. To his credit, Padillo, forced by his own superiors to make the extortion, had the decency to be embarrassed.\nSo began the partnership between the two men, one that would quickly turn into a life-long friendship. Mike Padillo worked for the government (probably the CIA). When not on assignment, he helped run the bar, which grew over the years in success and made both a considerable amount of money. But every couple of months, he would show up, tell McCorkle he'd be gone for a while, and a week or a month would go by with him gone.\nSuch was the basis for the series which probably was never meant to be one. The ending of the first book made it pretty clear that was it. Then the book won for Mr. Thomas an Edgar for the best first novel of 1966. I'm sure that's when the publishers began to demand a sequel.\nThe sequel came the next year but this time Mr. Thomas apparently withstood the pressure for more and used his incredible talent on other ideas. Six books, including three in a different non-spy series followed before the pair of McCorkle and Padillo were heard from again. And then it would be 19 years more before the last in the series was written.\nThrough the years, the two unwavering qualities of this series remained the close friendship between McCorkle and Padillo and the terrific writing skills of Ross Thomas.\nMcCorkle discovers that his friend and partner has been sacrificed by his superiors in an exchange with the Soviets to get back two defectors. He realizes he is the only one willing to risk it all for Padillo.\nHappily married and living in Washington, McCorkle would have been happy to meet his old friend Padillo if McCorkle's wife had been kidnapped to force Padillo to kill someone.\nLong out of the game, both men are less than anxious to help protect the future king of a country rich with oil but Padillo owes a huge favor to the ones doing the asking.\nThe death of a CIA agent didn't raise too much of a fuss until it is learned he wrote a tell-all book which someone wants buried, possibly along with the agent's son who might have it. The son asks Padillo and McCorkle for help.\nA fellow spy-fiction fan and friend of mine was almost jumping for joy when he got his hands on \"The Backup Men\" in 1972-3, shouting, \"They're back! McCorkle and Padillo!\" You would have thought I'd slapped him by his expression when I asked, \"Who?\"\nAfter having the first book literally thrust into my hands later and reading the first few pages, I knew I'd never have to ask that question again. I was as hooked as my friend (thank you, Bob Walker, wherever you are!).\nIt isn't hard to understand why anyone who likes spy-fi would love this series. Mr. Thomas's skill as an author are without a doubt. The man won TWO Edgars. Most writers don't win any. He had two. And deserved them both handily.\nFurthermore, the characters are awesomely interesting and developed, the style is both exciting and wry, the locales are perfectly presented, and the plots just make sense. What more can you ask for, except more adventures.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Thomas' passing makes that impossible but I like to believe that McCorkle and Padillo are still out there, serving drinks and saving the day.",

    "text": "The other night, while staying over at my in-laws\u2019 place in the countryside, my husband and I were just about to get ready for bed when it hit us.\nOh crap, we\u2019d left the laundry in the washing machine all afternoon. We\u2019d forgotten to hang it out to dry.\nWe bounded downstairs to the laundry room with flashlight in hand, and fully expected to spend 10 to 15 minutes doing what we should have done more than six hours ago.\nExcept, when I ran over to the washing machine, it was empty. Totally empty. And when I turned my head, sure enough, there was our laundry, neatly hung on clothes hangers on a bamboo rack.\nAs much as I felt relieved that I\u2019d been saved the trouble of doing that laundry this evening, a slight sense of guilt pricked me.\nOnce again, my mother-in-law had done housework for me. Housework I could have easily done for myself\u2026and should have done, given it was my laundry.\nIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit that I\u2019m in my thirties and still enjoy laundry assistance from my mother-in-law whenever we stay at her home in the countryside of Zhejiang Province. But it\u2019s true. This sort of thing happens ALL the time.\nYes, it\u2019s true. My mother-in-law has been known to hang up my clothing left in the washing machine\u2026and she\u2019s even done entire loads of laundry for us.\nHere\u2019s what usually happens. Either I put the clothing in the washing machine, but stupidly forget to hang it up on time (like I mentioned in the introduction). Or, my mother-in-law grabs my dirty clothing without telling me, and does the entire load for me (this happened ALL THE TIME when I stayed with my in-laws during the summer of 2011).\nSometimes, though, I do ask for her help. The other day, we were in a hurry to leave their house and I had just thrown a load of laundry into the washing machine. So I asked her if she could hang it and she said, \u201cNo problem\u201d with a smile.\nSo now you know one of my biggest dirty secrets.\nWhen we stay with my in-laws at their home, there\u2019s one thing we can count on \u2013 three square meals, all home-cooked by my mother-in-law. Always.\nThis is the complete opposite of how things work at my parents\u2019 home back in the US. There, the assumption is we\u2019re on our own and have to make our own meals (or buy them). Unless, of course, my dad or mom specifically asks us to join them for a meal (or invites us out).\nThe difference totally blew my husband\u2019s mind.\nAnyhow, here at my in-laws\u2019 home in China there\u2019s never any concern about cooking. Everyone knows that when it\u2019s lunch and dinner, my mother-in-law\u2019s voice will echo through the corridors \u2013 time to eat! \u2013 and we\u2019ll all come bounding down the stairs.\nIt\u2019s a strange place for me. I spent so many years handling all my cooking (and enjoying much of it). Now, when I\u2019m staying with my in-laws, I just show up to eat at the table.\nI have spent some time with my mother-in-law in the kitchen, learning how to cook from her. (She taught me how to make vegan Chinese-style flatbread, for example.) But in many ways, I feel foreign in her kitchen, a feeling that has nothing to do with my nationality, actually. After all, she uses a fire-powered wok to do the majority of her cooking, and I honestly have no idea how to manage the fire. Given how clumsy I am, I might just burn down the kitchen if I tried!\nNow that I think about it, maybe it is better to leave the cooking to a woman who won\u2019t cause a conflagration in the kitchen.\nWhen a friend of mine \u2014 also a Western woman with a Chinese husband \u2013 posted in a private chat about how guilty she felt because her mother-in-law gave her some cash to buy a new laptop (her old one crashed), oh, how I could sympathize.\nI thought about the many Chinese New Years that had passed since John and I returned to China in late 2013, and how his parents always gave us heaping hongbao filled with more money than adults in the family should have.\nI remembered how my mother-in-law handed over an additional stack of bills last year because my husband was starting his business (and she wanted him to have some \u201clucky money\u201d).\nI even thought of the numerous times when my mother-in-law spent money on us that she totally shouldn\u2019t have spent. Like buying those new coats for John for Chinese New Year (which prompted me to buy new clothes to make her happy). Or the comforter she bought for me to stay warm during the winter. Or even the way she purchased all of the basic necessities for our apartment in 2014.\n#4: We\u2019ve lived with my in-laws. A lot.\nIn America, the ultimate badge of adulthood is having your own place, separate from mom and dad.\nWell, the most embarrassing thing I could mention on this list is the fact that we\u2019ve lived in the same house as my in-laws \u2013 for long periods of time.\nEven now, we divide our time between an apartment in Hangzhou and their home. Heck, they added an entire suite to the house just for my husband and me, which proves how welcoming they are.\nIt\u2019s worlds away from America. I can guarantee you that if I asked my American friends and classmates, none of them would say that their parents or in-laws renovated their homes so they could live together. It\u2019s just not done there.\nAs embarrassing as it is to admit this, I have to confess I\u2019m also grateful. This suite they\u2019ve provided us is symbolic of the incredible support they\u2019ve given me and my husband.\nLife isn\u2019t always easy for John and me. But knowing that we have a couple of incredibly loving parents behind us \u2013 willing to do things that I\u2019m a little embarrassed to talk about \u2013 makes the hard times a little more bearable.\nIf you\u2019re all grown up, is there anything you\u2019re embarrassed that your parents or in-laws still do for you?\nLOL, you do laundry like Andy. Except I\u2019m willing to bet that you really do forget to collect it from the washer, whereas I suspect Andy \u201cforgets\u201d so I will finish doing the laundry for him.\nOnly problem is that he sometimes forgets to tell me he put in laundry while I\u2019m gone and it sits in the washer for days. MILDEWING!\nI don\u2019t get red envelopes. \ud83d\ude41 Jealous.\nWow\u2026 it\u2019s great you have so supportive in-laws.\nBut I don\u2019t think I could handle someone else doing my laundry and cooking. When my Filipino husband and I first got married, my sister-in-law kept taking over the cooking \u2013 she wouldn\u2019t let me do it and she wouldn\u2019t teach me how to cook Filipino dishes. This left me feeling totally useless as a wife, because I wanted to fulfill the role of taking care of my husband (an important element of the culture here).\nWhen we moved out and built our own home things radically changed for the better. We now have privacy and can really relax together.\nBut each to his own of course! You have done really well to adjust to such a profoundly different environment to that in America.\nThanks for sharing Hope! It was an adjustment \u2014 and as you say, it\u2019s certainly not for everyone.\nTrue that, typical Chinese parents, last time my girlfriend and I visited my parents , they took care of almost everything(of course, I, as an \u201ctypical\u201d Chinese kid, was and still am used to that), and before we left, she tried to give my girlfriend somethinkg like 5000 yuan.\nWow, that sounds a lot like my in-laws!\nYou\u2019re lucky to have such wonderful in-laws, especially with your mother-in-law cooking three meals a day.\nI don\u2019t have any trouble having someone wash my clothes. When I visit my youngest daughter (the cleanest one in the family) she washes my clothes with hers and brings them back to me folded.\nThat is sweet your in-laws were so welcoming.\nHey Jocelyn, great post as always! Just wanted to let you know I have also nominated you for the Blogger Recognition Award \u2013 thanks for being the grandmistress of AMWF blogs and thanks for introducing me to all the wonderful WWAMs in this world!\nAw, thanks for the nomination Laura, I\u2019m so touched! Yeah, it is great to be connected to all of these fabulous WWAMs!\nI share the four points with you, Jocelyn!(and it is, indeed, somewhat embarrassing). I see now that many Chinese in laws will do whatever it takes to spoil us. My father in law, for example, will sometimes go out early in the mornings to get us something delicious for breakfast, as well as \u706b\u9f99\u679c for me (my favourite fruit and utterly tasteless when I buy it imported in my country). He cleans, sweeps the floors, and generally keeps the house neat and spotless. He\u2019s like a cleaning hurricane, leaving no trace of the toys/crayons of our kids.\nMy mother in law, on the other hand, locks herself in the unbearably hot kitchen (in an already unbearably hot Nanjing) and cooks healthy meals, as well as doing other housework and taking care of my brother in law\u2019s little boy.\nNever, not even once, do they complain to anybody nor ask for gratitude. They fully sacrifice themselves in the most discrete way, but the effect of their actions is greater, like a sort of domestic \u201c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4e3a\u201d.\nWe\u2019ll be in China for the summer, ready to be spoilt rotten again (I feel guilty for that, already).\nYour in-laws sound so much like mine. (My father-in-law loves getting up early to buy tofu at the local market!) My mother-in-law is the epitome of sacrifice. Everything she does is for family and it\u2019s extraordinary.\nHave fun during your summer in China!\nMy wife\u2019s parents had long since passed away when we married, and her second mother lived with her fifth younger brother, so there was never a parent\u2019s home in the countryside. However, that never prevented the rest of the family showing us hospitality similar to that you describe. When we went to fifth younger sister\u2019s home in a compound for retired military, third younger brother\u2019s home in Alhambra, fourth younger brother\u2019s home in Monterey Park, or our \u201cch\u2019in chia (qin jia)\u201d stepson\u2019s wife\u2019s parent\u2019s home high up on the slopes of Kuan Yin Shan outside of Taipei, everyone went well out of their way to see that we were comfortable and well fed, and that I was never left out of the conversation with the language changed from Mandarin to Minnan.\nOur experience in China is a reflection on Western and American ideas of the individual and the community. A lot of the angst of young Americans may start with the separation anxiety forced upon us by our culture, that pushes us apart instead of drawing us in together, and by the pounding refrain of compete, compete, compete, which early on sets us against one another (Chinese usually wait until they get into business). Western philosophy\u2019s preoccupation with the individual over the group, existence before essence, alters our social relations everywhere we turn. Chinese would just laugh at Sartre and tell us the essence and existence go together.\nDon\u2019t be embarrassed about all this. Step back far enough to see both cultures in clear perspective. And next time post about all the things you have discovered you can do to return their kindness to your family.\nYou are blessed to be experiencing \u201cessence\u201d together with \u201cexistence.\u201d Enjoy.\nJames, thank you so much for the thoughtful comment. How lovely that your wife\u2019s family has been so hospitable towards you.\nYou make a good point \u2014 you have to wonder if America has it wrong in pushing kids out so early.\nGreat care from parents never end in China. But some time that leads to downfall of self-care ability of their children. Never grown up even in college.\nLooks like another Western woman joined the club here.\nThanks AG. Yes, there\u2019s a balance to be sure. Thank you also for sharing the news of the couple!\nI think it\u2019s interesting that somehow it is part of Chinese hospitality, right? Also, has to do with being family as well. Parents are still there to try to \u201chelp\u201d you out. I do agree of the embarrassment when your mother-in-law finishes your laundry. It\u2019s the same embarrassment I felt last year when my dad cleaned my bedroom at home when I lived at school. or when my dad folds all the laundry in the laundry room, including mine. T-T (only does this when he\u2019s tired of how messy the laundry room is.\nI can\u2019t accept money, maybe gifts. Every time my friend and I talk on the phone I argue with him and tell him I don\u2019t want him to pay for my round-trip flight from SH to CQ and he\u2019s telling me no worries. I eventually gave up.\nI think it\u2019s more of a mutual benefit, you help them out and they help you out, it\u2019s beneficial.\nJocelyn, I have been following your blog for some time now. Remember, I emailed you last year that I had read every single posts on your blog.\nI\u2019m not surprised that John\u2019s family has been so helpful and hospitable towards you. You deserve it.\nP/S There are meaty posts of substance on your blog; from yourself and other bloggers. Thank you so much for the share. I also enjoyed your post on 5 things you leart from the Chinese countryside etc. Life\u2019s simplest pleasures.\nLOL. So true! My parents still do our laundry, do all the dishes and cook for us whenever we visit them. They do the same when they come to visit us. Only exception is the laundry since they are not familiar with the washing machine we use. My mom always say, \u201cyou don\u2019t know how I clean dishes! I like it my way.\u201d It\u2019s tiring to argue with her. The money thing also. They always try to give us money. I was like, \u201cMom, we are the one making money now!\u201d oh well\u2026. guess it\u2019s a good problem to have!\nYour inlaws are so sweet! They feel like it\u2019s their duty to their son. I had the same experience when I was married to \u201cCai\u201d in that my inlaws sacrificed their happiness and well-being to drop everything to help us in the US. They kept telling me it\u2019s their duty. I know it helped us out a ton. But my mom also went way above and beyond and she\u2019s not Chinese. She quit her job when I moved back home so she could help me with Jake. My parents renovated their basement to add a bedroom and full bathroom so my uncle could move down there when Jake and I took over his room and bathroom upstairs. Parents show their love in many ways!\nWow, your mother-in-law actually uses a washing machine? My parents-in-law own a washing machine, but rarely use it. When we stay with them, my mother-in-law insists on doing my laundry as well, but by hand! She says she doesn\u2019t need a washing machine because \u201c\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u6d17\u8863\u673a\u201d (she is the washing machine). I have tried to stop her, but it\u2019s no use. Once when she was washing my clothes, she found a pair of my underwear had a hole in it, so she bought me new ones, talk about embarrassing!\nAwww I don\u2019t know if this is embarrassing! I think parents will always be parents no matter what (when I go home to visit and attempt to do my own laundry, my mom will scoop up my clothes from the dryer and fold them on my bed before I can even get to it!).\nIn America living with your parents until your early 30s isn\u2019t as taboo as it used to be (it\u2019s hard to stake out a living these days), so I think times are changing.\nI think my boyfriend and I will experience all of the above things with his Chinese in-laws sooner or later. They already cook and clean our house for us every time they come down to visit. I wish I could say I was embarrassed, but I\u2019m actually really happy to be spoiled once in a while!",

    "text": "Amid a contentious government shutdown, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has written President Trump a letter, suggesting that in lieu of delivering a State of the Union speech, as the president intends, he submit his address in writing.\nAlthough Americans today are accustomed to seeing the president deliver the SOTU, Pelosi notes in her letter that \u201cduring the 19th century and up until the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, these annual State of the Union messages were delivered to Congress in writing.\u201d Pelosi also notes that a SOTU has never been delivered amidst a government shutdown.\nAlthough the State of the Union started as an oral address\u2013both George Washington and John Adams delivered speeches to Congress\u2013Thomas Jefferson was the first to balk at the tradition.\nJefferson had several reasons why he believed a written address was superior to a speech. First of all, the third president nursed a fear of public speaking. He also believed that a letter was more efficient than a speech\u2013that it would take less time to read than to listen, and that a written document would give legislators time to think about their response. Historians have also noted that giving a speech had a king-like aura, something that a republican like Jefferson would abhor.\nThen again, Jefferson could have simply found trudging to Congress to give a speech inconvenient.\nIn any case, the tradition that Jefferson set remained for over one hundred years, until Woodrow Wilson decide to return to the ways of Washington and Adams, and give a speech before Congress instead of simply sending a letter.\nSince then, a spoken SOTU has indeed become a national habit, even more so than in Wilson\u2019s day thanks to mass communication tools like radio, television, and internet.\nThat\u2019s not to say that the written version of the SOTU has been abandoned entirely\u2013as lame duck presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, and Carter chose to submit a written message instead of giving a speech before Congress.\nWhether or not Trump will heed Pelosi\u2019s advice has yet to be seen, and certainly a president might balk at giving up the bully pulpit power of television. In any case, we\u2019ll leave you with a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt, who was thoroughly dismayed that Wilson had the idea of a SOTU speech, something that Roosevelt himself would have enthusiastically embraced.",

There have been no reports of similar disease in Massachusetts thus far.\nOne of the five children reported to the Minnesota Department of Health with invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease died. Only one of the children had completed the primary Hib immunization series; three had received no doses of Hib-containing vaccine, according to the CDC. \u201cThe five Hib cases are the largest number among children aged <5 years reported from Minnesota since 1992. The cases occurred during a Hib vaccine recall and continuing nationwide shortage that began in December 2007,\" said the CDC.\nAn American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) alert on the same date reminds pediatricians and family practitioners that it is \u201ccritically important\u201d for all infants to complete the primary three dose series of a Hib-containing vaccine on schedule.\n\u201cGiven the vaccine shortage, prolonged booster deferral, and reduced compliance with the primary series coverage, the increase in the number of Hib cases in Minnesota likely reflects a weakening of herd immunity \u2014 that is, the percentage of immunized children in the population has dropped below a certain critical level,\u201d said the AAP.\nPrior to widespread Hib vaccination, H. Influenzae b was a frequent cause of bacterial meningitis and epiglottitis in infants and young children.\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health has also distributed an alert, reminding practitioners to vaccinate infants against H. influenza.

    "text": "What Impact Will a 9% Drop in Profits Have On Your Organization?\nUnless your Supply Management organization takes it to the next level, your company is facing a 9% drop in corporate profits this year due to rising prices and other inflationary pressure according to a recent Hackett Group study. For a typical Global 1000 company with 27.8 billion in revenue, Hackett\u2019s study estimated that commodity and offshore labor inflation will drive a 150 million per year hit to the bottom line. Ouch!\nWhy? While most companies are now able to effectively anticipate commodity price increases, more than 60% of companies surveyed by Hackett in the recent study have not been successful at mitigating these cost increases. The reality is that few executives have experienced significant inflation, which is now at levels not seen in 30 years (when inflation rates hovered around 13% back in 1981).\nAnd while inflation may not yet be at 13%, it is bad. Not only do respondents to the Hackett study expect the rate of inflation for commodities overall to rise by more than 30%, to 6.3% a year, but commodity price volatility has increased nearly 60% since before the recession. Making matters worse, at the same time, due to the talent crunch, the rate for internal labor is expected to more than triple from 0.7% to 2.2% and the rate of inflation for external labor is expected to more than double from 1.2% to 3%.\nThis entry was posted in Analyst, Economics on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nRegular readers of SI will know the importance of good should-cost modeling (which is also great for negotiations) as well as good market intelligence (which has dimensions and is valuable in a down economy) in cost reduction and avoidance. And while both should-cost modelling and market intelligence have a number of critical requirements that must be met for success, they both have one key requirement in common \u2014 good data. But where do you get good data? Certainly not from supplier bids! A new supplier is going to bid what it thinks it can get, not what the actual price is. Market indices from governments and professional associations? Better, but they will typically be at least a month or so behind. Trade associations that track and monitor prices on a daily basis or stock markets that trade the commodity? Great \u2014 but do you have the IT skills to integrate the feeds? And are you going to do it for the dozens of raw materials and commodities you need to build your should cost models?\nTo help their clients understand the data, Mintec provides a data analysis package, called Datagain, which can be used to import, graph, analyze, and compare different line items (such as the petrol price in the UK and the petrol price in Australia, normalized to US dollars). A user can graph any set of series, against any frequency, using any (currency and unit) converions, for any date range she chooses. She can also normalize or index this data using a custom formula, factor in seasonality, and plot trends. She can also break the series down across two or four graphs and/or plot specific subseries, against different projections, to see how the price might trend over time under different assumptions. The normalization / indexing equations can use all of the standard algebraic operators and be defined over any set of variables, including user defined variables, that the user chooses.\nIf the user is not sophisticated at trend analysis, or does not want to do it, Mintec also offers Benchmarking and Market (Intelligence) Report services that do a deep dive into a particular raw material, commodity, or service that discuss recent, current, and projected pricing subject to the state of the market and the dominant factors at play. These, by request, reports complement the monthly market reports and commodity fact sheets that track the major commodities and markets and their relative month-over-month changes for buyers who want to look at the bigger picture. If the user wants to learn more about Datagain, analysis, and should-cost modeling, Mintec also provides on-demand out-of-the-box and customized training sessions as well as quarterly newsletters and occasional articles.\nIt\u2019s a huge amount of data, that comes at a very low price point. Most customers pay less than 100K \u00a3s for access to the data they need, when they need it, updated as often as they like. Moreover, medium-sized business can get basic access (to the datafeeds) and access to the desktop Datagain tool for as little as 10K \u00a3s a year. Large enterprises will probably want the on-line hosted applet version (at the higher price-point) that runs through the browser on a hosted database that is accessible anywhere, anytime, and always up to date. While it is more expensive, it\u2019s still cheap compared to what the organization will be paying for their ERP solution (and much more valuable from a cost avoidance perspective).\nThis entry was posted in Best Practices, Market Intelligence on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nTMS Requires 100 Million, Does ERP Require 1 Billion?\nBen Pivar, Vice President and North American Supply Chain Lead for Capgemini regarding Transportation Management Systems (TMS) Pivar says that the economics of installing a TMS package on a client server, for example, doesn\u2019t really work until you have nearly $100 million in freight spend and that\u2019s why on-demand is so popular in that space.\nSI has to agree. Unless a firm has tens of millions in freight spend, the costs of installation, maintenance, and usage tend to dwarf the benefits of using a TMS system. However, what\u2019s even more important to note is that enterprise ERP (from a top vendor) is, on average, at least five, if not (usually) ten times, more expensive to install, integrate, maintain, and use than TMS. This would seem to indicate that the economics of traditional ERP don\u2019t make sense unless your company has 1 Billion in spend, or at least 1 Billion in revenue. In other words, unless you\u2019re a member of the Fortune 2000 or Global 3000, traditional end-to-end on-premise enterprise ERP is probably not for you. And it would appear that Oracle, one of the largest players, tends to agree. Why do you think it has advertisements stating it has 98% of the Fortune 500? It\u2019s not just because the Fortune X, it\u2019s target market, provide it with its biggest deals. It\u2019s because Oracle also understands that unless a company has reached a critical mass, given the cost of the system, the company won\u2019t get the advertised return (which is a key to keeping the company as a high-paying customer year after year).\nHowever, every organization needs a good transaction store and data repository as analysis is key to supply management success. So what does this mean if you\u2019re not one of the lucky ones? Don\u2019t look at a a tradtional on-premise end-to-end ERP from a big boy. Look at either a newer, smaller, slimmed down offering from a smaller player, possibly based on an open-source solution (like Compiere), a suite from a provider that maintains its own transaction store, or a newer, slimmed down, SaaS offering from a traditional provider that can integrate with some BoB solutions in the cloud and offer an effective hybrid solution. Just don\u2019t go for the billion-dollar solution, because your organization likely won\u2019t get a return from the millions it will cost.\nThis entry was posted in Inventory, Logistics, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nCheck out the live debate in two hours (@ 2pm EDT) between Paul Martyn, VP of Supply Strategy at BravoSolution, and Howard Coleman, principal of MCA Associates, to find out.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nAs per yesterday\u2019s post, it\u2019s been less than five months since we last checked in with Trade Extensions, who had traded up to a Fact Sheet User Interface and added a slew of new features, including improved RFI support, multi-dimensional rankings in e-Negotiation, Google Earth integration, new incumbent rules, and an OLAP foundation to reporting, including the implementation of a new n-way comparison report. Since then, Trade Extensions has been on a tear to add new functionality as fast as it can to make the platform not only one of the most powerful expressive bidding optimization platforms on the planet, but also one of the easiest to use \u2014 listening to its users (which include the Fortune 1000) and adding features and functions that make an average buyer\u2019s life easier, taking usability to a whole new level yet again. And while earth-shattering technology improvements are cool, it is usability that is the ultimate key to to adoption, use, and, ultimately, cost avoidance and reduction in your sourcing organization.\nNot only are there new rules that allow partial awards to be fixed based upon existing scenarios, but the number of constraint categories has doubled. While there were only general and incumbent constraints in the past, there are now an entire category of scenario reference rules and post processing rules. With respect to scenario reference rules, not only can allocations be kept, but bids can be favoured or penalized as well. The post-processing rules are also quite useful. Allocations can automatically be rounded and allocations that don\u2019t meet a minimum number of units can be removed (or re-assigned to the supplier who meets a minimum allocation with the lowest total cost).\nThe buyer now has fine-grained control over what the supplier sees, and can even mix feedback types. For example, if the buyer only wants the top three suppliers to know they are top three, but suppliers four to six to know their exact rank, they can specify that specific rank starts at bidder four, and the top bidders default to \u201ctop 3\u201d. In addition, if the supplier does not meet a minimum bid increment, which can be defined in a number of ways (including, minimum dollar or % decrease over last bid), the supplier gets a nice red error that the bid is not acceptable AND a message indicating the minimum increment required. Finally, and this is really cool, the user can define custom color-coded bid feedback fields based on dynamic formulas that now only let the user know where they rank, but how competitive their bid is (against the current bids from the competition) in English using a buyer defined scale such as \u201cCompetitive\u201d, \u201cSlightly Competitive\u201d, \u201cNot Competitive\u201d, and \u201cNot Acceptable\u201d.\nPlus, the buyer can now chat with users online in an integrated IM client, and immediately see who is online when they log in as it is a widget on their project management dashboard.\nThe \u201cdashboards\u201d for RFX and auction phases have also improved. The summary, bidder summary, and lot summary are now completely customizeable by the user, support custom fields, and user-defined colour codings in the rankings. In addition, there is integrated show/hide, drill-down functionality, and customizeable pop-up (bid, trend, and bidder activity) charts where a user can select one, some, or all of the rows in each report.\nAll and all, it\u2019s a lot of new functionality in a short time frame that makes the tool extremely useable by an average buyer.\nThis entry was posted in Decision Optimization, Spend Analysis, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.",

    "text": "[AUTO](RC):[Counter Blast (1) & Put this unit into your soul] During your opponent's end phase, when an opponent's locked card is unlocked, if you have a \u00abLink Joker\u00bb vanguard, you may pay the cost. If you do, lock that unit.\n...personally, this card is just annoying to go against regardless of whom the Link Joker's final ace is. The fact that Palladium here is made to keep that disruption factor that the Lock effect really has on the opponent by keeping it locked and either severely weakening attacks or even preventing them from ever happening to begin with at the cost of himself. Now, it would be bad if it was just retired and you'd never see it again, but I personally see this as beneficiary as possible by it going into the Soul as Chaos Breaker Dragon will have more Soul food to eat when you want to start killing things and begin drawing more cards and just plus sing in general.\nThere are two major drawbacks to Palladium however. One is that you have to be able to actually Lock something to begin with, and if you are unsuccessful at Break Riding with Infinite-Zero Dragon, then it'll cost you even more Counterblast to even get the Lock to begin with let alone retaining it. The other drawback is that you end up losing Palladium by it going into the Soul and losing a 7,000 power supporter, but seeing how he's able to potentially stop a single attack from even happening singlehandedly is just phenomenal and worth the loss especially if you can reinforce it when the spot is open anyway.\nPalladium is made to be more of a defensive card with offensive stats, so while others sleep on this card *looks down*, I personally am keeping an eye out against this card.\nNext Time: While it's not from Set 13, it's still a Grade 1/7,000 Power that I believe that this card deserves a lot of acknowledgement!\n4th card of the week is Link Joker's newest troll card, Palladium. When a unit unlocks during the End Phase, you Counterblast 1 and move him from RG to the soul to lock it again.\nHooray, finally I can talk about this card in more detail than the others. Firstly, this card is pretty neat in Chaos Breaker Dragon decks. His uses are fairly extensive, with the most obvious being he fuels the soul for Chaos Breaker's Limit Break. He can also shut down a front row and thus a whole column for another turn without Chaos needing to commit anything else from the hand. Especially if you have a better booster and need to sack it away nice and neatly.\nHe's also good for when you are stuck riding Chaos on turn 3 and you're reduced to playing the stall game until you can Chaos Retire away their units. However, if your actual gambit of Chaos Breaker over Infinite Zero works, Palladium's pretty redundant, unless you absolutely need one of their columns re-locked for any reason, since locking generally isn't as good as retiring in terms of long-term benefits.\nThe fact he now has Colony Maker to search him helps too. I'd run him, if only because to give Chaos more shots at retiring and also because Link Joker has plenty of 7k boosters to play with.",

    "text": "Like most people I find it intimidating to cook a whole live lobster. So I love to cook with lobster tails, its simple to work with and I don\u2019t have to kill anything. Since lobster meat is delicate and sweet, I deviated from strong flavors but used some spices to enhance and compliment the lobster meat\u2026.\nThis curry is great for those new to Indian cooking as it does not use a ton of ingredients and is relatively simple to follow.\nVada is a South Indian savory fritter made with soaked lentils and usually fried to a golden crisp. This recipe is baked with little to no oil for a healthier alternative. I used green split pea unlike the typical split chana dal (dry split chickpea) for variation. This recipe works well with chickpeas, black lentil and other legumes.\nThe most important step is soaking the peas till it plumps up three times their size. I soak the peas for a minimum of 12 \u2013 24 hours to make it easier to digest. Change the soaking water every 3-4 hours, till the water is clear and free of bubbles. Add a pinch of sea salt when soaking overnight to draw out the gas which will form bubbles on top of the water. Be sure to use cold water when rinsing and soaking the peas. Changing the soaking water and adding some sea salt helps reduce bloating and uncomfortable gas associated with legumes.\nIn the above the picture you see the difference between dry and soaked split peas. Another advantage to soaking the peas for 12-24 hours is the peas grind smoother and cooks evenly\u2026.\nLumpia is a fried spring roll made with minced meat and a variety of vegetables, made famous as the Filipino eggroll. Some varieties are fried with raw pork or beef, others with cooked filling. For safety reasons I like to fully cook my meat before filling the lumpias.\nLumpias uses an array of vegetables but feel free use what is on hand and personal preference. The only substitutions I wouldn\u2019t make are garlic and red onion because they are the foundation of flavors. I used a series of colorful vegetables like sweet red bell peppers, crunchy celery, savory red onions, and crispy carrots. Soy sauce and rice wine vinegar are added to season the meat. The rice wine vinegar is mellow and sweet, great for balancing the salty bite of soy sauce. Rice wine vinegar is low in acidity, unlike other varieties of vinegars\u2026.\nTuna wrap is an easy healthy flavorful recipe that is great for lunch or dinner. This recipe isn\u2019t loaded with a million spices and complicated steps, it\u2019s easy for anyone to make.\nThis recipe uses canned white albacore tuna. I\u2019m not a fan of dark fish meat because it\u2019s too musky. The albacore tuna can be quite meaty as it is canned as a portion of a tuna steak. I break it apart with my hand so it\u2019s flaky and can evenly disperse with the vegetables. Squeeze as much water out of the tuna as you can otherwise the final dish will be watery.\nThe combination of vegetables used are light and flavorful. The vegetables are finely minced to speed up the cooking process and blend with the flaked tuna. The base flavor for the tuna are minced red onion, ginger, garlic and chili. The green bell pepper and celery are savory and give a slight crunch. The turmeric powder gives a depth of flavor and the chili powder gives spiciness. These spices combined give the tuna a beautiful orange hue\u2026.\nThis is a healthy recipe using a whole red snapper. Seems imitating? Luckily the fish monger does most of the hard work of gutting and removing the scales of the fish. I love red snapper because of its delicate white meat. But any medium sized white fleshed fish would work just as well\u2026.\nIf you\u2019re craving a spicy hearty Indian chicken recipe that is somewhat easy\u2026this dish is for you!\nMaking a paste marinade allows the spices and fresh ingredients to seep into the chicken, tenderizing it and insuring it will be succulent. Roughly chop the red onion (you can substitute with white onion), ginger, bird\u2019s eye chilies, and crush the garlic. It makes it easier for the food processor or handheld emulsifier to grind through. I leave the curry leaves whole before I grind them, since the leaves are not fibrous. Curry leaves give the dish a distinct earthy floral flavor, mainly used in South Indian dishes. Most grocery stores carry it, but if you are out of luck, substitute with cilantro\u2026.\nThis recipe is a healthy delicious vegetarian dish. If you\u2019re not a fan of a particular vegetable, try roasting it and you might be surprised! Slowly roasting the vegetables allows any existing sugar content to caramelize. So the vegetable is left sweet, nutty, and earthy which melts in your mouth.\nThe combination of vegetables I used in this recipe is great, but feel free to use what you have on hand, or according to your personal preference. To make this dish more filling I used mainly root vegetables like parsnips, carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes and cauliflower. Also I added aromatic vegetables for flavor, like green bell pepper, red onion, and the garlic. All the vegetables are cut to roughly one inch pieces, to ensure even cooking\u2026.\nThese baked chicken wings have the same crispiness and guilty pleasure of fried wings, but without gallons of wasted oil or exploding wing particles!",

    "text": "Call It Arson plays out of the Old Saybrook area of Connecticut, probably about an hour and a half from where I used to live. Being so close, they've become a local favorite, and rightfully so. I think they're one of the few musical acts around now that still make original music. You can tell that the individual styles of the members all contribute to the bands overall sound, which I always find interesting. They've managed to create a heavy aesthetic while retaining acoustic and folk rock elements to their songs; the harmonica and acoustic guitar are always as audible as the driving low end. Singers James Downes and Ryan White have very distinct, unique qualities to their voices that blend and mesh like they were from the same family.\nThey're one of the few bands in the area who are seeing some success, having shared the stage with bands like Cursive and The Appleseed Cast. On May 20th of 2008, Call It Arson released \"Moth Wash: The Old Flames Seven Inch\" which features a lonely two songs but comes with an MP3 download of all the files. Moth Wash is the latest of three releases since 2006, after \"The Animal Strings Album\" and \"Call It Arson\" a self titled, 10 track album. Look for Call It Arson on Kill Normal Records, alongside bands like They And The Children, Stab You In The Head and The Flaming Tsunamis.\nHere are some of our first MP3 downloads on My Son Cool. These songs are great and everyone should hear them, but if you like these songs please support this band and their music. All of these CD's are available on the Kill Normal Website for cheap.\nI'll be totally honest, if I had my way I'd have different songs on here but we do what we can. You might not be able to download them, but go to the Call It Arson myspace and listen to \"Eliza\" and \"Sharpie,\" my two favorite songs of theirs, just take my word for it. Both songs are beautiful and haunting in their almost anthem-like composition. \"Sharpie\" shares the mentality of \"There's A Way To Be On,\" being the other track from Moth Wash.",

    "text": "In our biggest issue ever, the Information Architecture Institute (IAI) Newsletter features news about IAI and our partner's sites: Asis&t Bulletin, Boxes and Arrows, and the Web Indexing SIG. We have also added a list of conferences, workshops with great discounts for members and job postings at the end, so scroll down!\nFirst of all, a hearty thanks to the new Board of the IAI for letting me write you one last time in an official capacity. Having served on the Board of Directors for four years (and president for the past two), I've been asked to highlight some of the dramatic changes the Institute has undergone since 2004.\nLet me start by saying that had I not been elected to the Board in August 2004, I probably wouldn't have renewed my membership. My perception was that the Institute was an elitist club. And apparently I was elected because others saw things the same way \u00d0 I was seen as a change agent.\nAlthough a perception is always \"true\" in the eyes of the beholder, my perception back in 2004 was certainly ill-informed; our founders had set out along a difficult path \u00d0 clearly more difficult than they had first thought. And organizational transparency, then as now, was a hot topic in the community.\nBack in 2004, we had around 500 members \u00d0 but no one was quite sure. At best, we hoped people were paying their dues. We didn't answer a lot of our e-mail because we didn't always get the mail to begin with. One thing we did know, our churn rate was dismal. In order to address these growing problems, the 2004-5 Board decided to meet weekly rather than just twice a month. We have done so ever since, which comes to just under 200 Board sessions during my tenure.\nSo, what have we accomplished? Plenty!\nNumerous initiatives that were wishful thinking back in 2004 are now a reality. And many of our original initiatives have become full-fledged member benefits, including our job board, annual salary survey, and mentoring program. We've also helped put IA on the corporate radar. This past January, Fortune magazine published a special advertising section featuring information architecture and the Institute. Our website is better focused. A book project is in the works, too.\nTo help improve transparency, we now have a monthly newsletter \u00d0 each prefaced by a letter like this from a Board member. Our Annual Report has grown to 21 pages of management discussion and financials. The past three years, we've also held live annual meetings in conjunction with the IA Summit.\nOur conference, IDEA, the brainchild of past-president Peter Merholz, is now going into its third successful year. We've also awarded six progress grants to worthy research projects. We are about to announce our very own peer-reviewed journal (ETA for the first issue: March 2009). And today's members now enjoy over 45 free or discounted events each year \u00d0 plus virtual events in Second Life.\nToday, we have three paid staff members. We have over 120 active volunteers registered on Basecamp. Over 600 volunteer hours are donated to the Institute each and every week. And we answer our mail. Churn is down; we have around 2000 members in over 80 countries. That's because the IA Institute now provides more bang-for-the-buck than any other organization in the interactive arena.\nOf course, our membership continues to grouse about the Institute's leadership. Thank goodness \u00d0 perhaps this will inspire even more people to get involved. In the meantime, I'm proud of the results we've achieved these past four years. I'm honored to have served with so many talented individuals. And I'm looking forward to holding a vacation without searching for a landline each Wednesday for the weekly conference call.\nThe annual IA Special Issue of the ASIS&T Bulletin offers articles from some of the best presentations from this year's IA Summit. Tingting Jiang's and Sherry Koshman's \"Exploratory Search in Different Information Architectures\" treats exploratory search and better user experience. Gene Smith's \"Tagging: Emerging Trends\" describes how top-down hierarchies and bottom-up user-contributed classification are now being used together. Luke Wroblewski's \"The Information Architecture Behind Good Web Forms\" outlines a straightforward, effective approach for forms that actually work, Nathan Curtis' \"Audiences & Artifacts\" considers design documentation from a business point of view, and Leah Buley's \"How to be a User Experience Team of One\" is a practical blend of philosophy and applicability.\nCompleting usability testing in a short amount of time is a challenge that consultancies and development teams often face. In the first part of a two-part series, Paul Nuschke describes how to cut time out of the preparation leading up to a study. Part two will discuss how to run the study and analyze the findings.\nOnline forms can be challenging as even in their utility and necessity, we generally need to lure users to complete them. Afshan Kirmani takes the example of an online email application form and explains some fundamental principles that can help us design effective forms.\nThe Web Indexing SIG (Special Interest Group) promotes the human indexing of Web sites and HTML documents.\nEvents on the IAI Calendar website offer discounts to members. We are always looking for new partners and events we can share with our membership and newsletter subscribers. If you would like to promote your event, please contact events AT iainstitute DOT org.\nThe Calendar is bursting with events, check out the full listings online!\nRegistration is open! Pre-conference program available! Speakers announced! The third annual IDEA Conference, the IA Institute's own take on design for an always-on, always-connected world, is coming to Chicago this fall.\nIn this day-long workshop, Lou Rosenfeld\u00d1co-author of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web and the forthcoming Search Analytics for your Site: Conversations with your customers\u00d1will combine lecture, discussion, and extensive hands-on exercises to cover the basics of site search analytics. He'll show you how spending even an hour a week analyzing your search queries can help tune and improve your site's content, navigation, metadata, and search performance, and expose new opportunities for improving your business strategy.\nAttend Steve Krug's workshop the following day and receive additional discount.\nIAI members can use code \"IAI2008\" to receive a 15% discount for Steve and Lou's workshops (if registering on Lou's site, please use the fax option only).\nHeld in the high tech sector in Burlington, Massachusetts, the theme of the 10th Annual Documentation & Training East Conference is Producing Quality Content. The event includes a special focus on both software documentation project best practices and translation and localization issues. Companies that practice what they preach will be showcased. Paid registration also includes access to 2 days of hands-on software training workshops, choose from Adobe Technical Communication Suite, MadCap Software, Author-it, and XMetaL at no additional cost!\nContact Melissa at membership AT iainstitute DOT org to receive the code for your $200 off the registration price ($799 for IAI members!).\nSmart Experience is offering IA Institute members 10% off these fall workshops contact membership AT iainstitute DOT org for the discount code or login into the IAI Member Center and go to Member Discounts Section for your link.\nWith case studies and practical tips from Australia's leading organizations (including Sunguard NZ, Sparke Helmore, TabCorp, AMP and more!), this one-day conference will demonstrate how organizations are weaving social media tools into their existing intranet framework to enhance functionality and create two-way communication.\nDuring the course of this intensive one day event, an expert line-up of speakers (including University of Melbourne, Sensis, Blake Dawson Waldon, Department of Water WA and more!) will talk you through the steps you need to take in order to exploit the benefits of social media when related to your organizational taxonomies. Taxonomies are a fundamental part of your information architecture for the management and organization of content. With the introduction of 2.0 tools and applications, their importance has never been so prevalent.\nDuring this two-day intensive master class, Indi will give you a deep understanding of people's motivations and thought-processes, along with the emotional and philosophical landscape in which they are operating. You use mental models to align your design strategy with how people work. This intensive two-day course will help product designers, web designers and business strategists develop digital, physical, and environmental interactions that help people accomplish their goals.\nthese courses are incredible deals!\nPrice $250.

    "text": "\"ESET researchers have been tracking the TDL4 botnet for a long time, and now we have noticed a new phase in its evolution,\" announced David Harley, the company's director of malware intelligence.\n\"Based on the analysis of its components we can say that some of those components have been rewritten from scratch (kernel-mode driver, user-mode payload) while some (specifically, some bootkit components) remain the same as in the previous versions,\" he noted.\nTDL, also known as TDSS, is a family of rootkits characterised by complex and innovative detection evasion techniques. Back in July, malware analysts from Kaspersky Lab called TDL version 4 the most sophisticated threat in the world and estimated that the number of computers infected with it exceeds 4.5 million.\nHowever, according to ESET's researchers, changes are now being made to the way TDL4 infects systems and ensures its hold on them. Instead of storing components within the MBR, the new variants create a hidden partition at the end of the hard disk and set it as active.\nThis ensures that malicious code stored on it, including a special boot loader, gets executed before the actual operating system, and that the MBR code checked by antivirus programs for unauthorised modifications remains untouched.\n\"The malware is able to detect corruption of the files stored in the hidden file system by calculating its CRC32 checksum and comparing it with the value stored in the file header. In the event that a file is corrupted it is removed from the file system,\" the ESET researchers explain.\nIn April, Microsoft released a Windows update that modified systems to disrupt the TDL4 infection cycle. The rootkit's authors responded half a month later with an update of their own that bypassed the patch.\nSeveral antivirus vendors like Kaspersky, BitDefender or AVAST, offer free stand-alone tools that can remove TDSS and similar rootkits. However, in order to avoid getting infected in the first place users should install an antivirus solution that provides advanced layers of protection, like those analysing software behavior.",

    "text": "Ethereum Classic is a smart contract platform and ecosystem for decentralized applications and distributed computing. It was born due to a chain split on the original Ethereum blockchain. When the DAO-hack occurred, where 3.6m Ether was stolen, the Ethereum community discussed what to do.\nCan Ethereum Classic be mined?\nWhat differs Ethereum Classic from other Cryptocurrencies?\nHow much is Ethereum Classic worth today?\nWhere can you buy ETC?\nCan ETC be sold for cash?\nThe majority favored a hard fork with the purpose of rendering the stolen Ether useless, but a small minority was strictly against it. They stated that \u201ccode is law\u201d and it would be against the spirit of decentralized systems to \u201cturn back time\u201d and reverse the blockchain with the help of a 51% majority.\nThe hard fork happened, and Ethereum abandoned the old chain. The small minority forked off of the new Ethereum and decided to continue developing the old chain. This old chain is now known as Ethereum Classic; the ticker is ETC.\nIn July 2016, more specifically at block 1 920 000, the hard fork was executed. After the fork, the chains were split in two and since then act individually. Ethereum Classic became a parallel blockchain, where in contrast to Ethereum the stolen funds were never returned to their owners.\nYes, it is based on Proof-of-Work (PoW). The mining algorithm is Ethash, which is a modified version of the Dagger-Hashimoto algorithm.\nThe main points that differ Ethereum Classic from his bigger counterpart are that its maximum supply is capped and that they don\u2019t have the massive resources and industry support like their bigger brother.\nThe maximum supply of ETC is 230 000 000 and the circulating supply at the time of writing is 101 442 324 ETC.\nYou can buy ETC on several cryptocurrency exchanges, most notably Bithump, Binance, Upbit, Huobi, and OKEx.\nYou can sell ETC for cash on several cryptocurrency exchanges that have fiat-pairings, most notably Bithump and Bitfinex.\nThe ETC team is actively working on further development and scalability of their platform.\nAlso, they are focussed on finding ways to integrate Ethereum Classic in the growing sector of the Internet of Things. Additionally, they work on the \u201cEmerald Platform,\u201d which is a set of libraries and tools for third-party application developers.\n5.5/10 What I like is that ETC capped their maximum supply, this creates SoV-characteristics. The downside is that ETH has far more resources, industry contacts, and partnerships than Ethereum Classic. This could lead to ETC being tailed off.\nAnother negative is that the stolen coins from the DAO-hack are still accessible for the hacker on the ETH chain. He currently holds 3.36 million ETC. The Ethereum foundation is also in possession of a massive amount of ETC, although they liquidated 90% of their position which they acquired through the hard fork. But there 10% is still a big enough number to move the market.",

    "text": "This article aims to demonstrate how leggings are not a garment that can only be worn by one age bracket. By paying particular attention to how leg wear can be worn and with what other garments, it is the aim to support the fact that leggings can be worn by ladies of all ages.\nLeggings have often been a garment associated with childrenswear. With their ease of movement and comfortable style, they are appropriate for a growing child who may change in size regularly. Stirrup style leggings are also popular amongst those purchasing childrenswear.\nEmerging from the eighties era, leg wear also become popular during this time when fitness wear was deemed stylish and worn as everyday wear. Popularised by chart topping bands of the time and the likes of Jane Fonda's workout videos, fitness wear was definitely a trend that many associate tight fitting leg wear with today. Whilst during the eighties, neon bright colours were popular for leg wear, but since then styles have developed and we now see that prints and patterns have become more and more popular. Seen on catwalks throughout London, Paris, Milan and New York, prints are consistently in fashion and are unlikely to ever go out. Whilst some prints come in and out of fashion such as animal print, other prints quickly come into replace them such as this season's popular print of dogtooth. What remains in style is the basic design of the garment such as classic leggings.\nDepending on the occasion they are worn for will also coincide with an acceptable age to wear leggings. For example, if an older lady wore leggings to the cheap, she may not be judged as much as if she was to wear them on a night out. Whilst they do make great gym wear, it is not to say that they cannot be worn for nights out. Recently popularised by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, leather look leg wear is at the height of fashion and create the perfect look for a night out, but should these style of leggings have an age restriction?\nIf the wearer feels comfortable in the garment, why should there be an age restriction? Yes it is clear that some styles will be more suited to some ages than others but it remains entirely the wearers choice.\nAnother consideration would have to be gender. There is nothing to say that men can also not wear leggings, if it is acceptable for the gym it should be acceptable for everyday wear.\nConclusively, leg wear has developed dramatically over the years and is clear to see that no age restrictions should be applicable when considering who can or cannot wear leggings.",

    "text": "California Vehicle Code 21058 is intended to protect patients who live in rural areas that may go to hospitals that do not have doctors on staff at all hours of the day and night. There are numerous situations when a doctor may be needed at legitimate emergencies, and getting there fast is essential. If there's a shooting victim, a car accident patient or a woman with labor complications, at a rural hospital it's important to get a doctor to the operating room fast. In rural areas the on-call surgeon may live 15 or 20 miles away from the hospital and it's important for that surgeon to be able to get there in a hurry without worrying about legal repercussions. There are still many rural hospitals in California that still rely on the on-call physician for emergencies.\nThis law was not designed to give doctors a \"get out of jail free\" excuse. There are still stipulations as to when the law applies. First, the doctor must be going to a legitimate emergency. Having dinner reservations, or being late to the airport will not constitute an emergency. Second, the doctor must maintain a reasonably safe speed. There is no excuse for driving recklessly, and doctors who cause harm to another person while speeding to an emergency will still be held accountable for their actions. Lastly, the doctors cannot allow someone else to borrow their car for the purposes of using the CMA sticker. This law only applies to a vehicle that is registered to a licensed doctor; if that vehicle is being used by the doctor; while the doctor is on his or her way to a real emergency.\nThis law does not prevent an officer from pulling over a doctor. The doctor must show that he or she is on their way to an emergency. While most officers will probably not question a licensed physician, an officer that questions the authenticity of the emergency can still issue a citation. The physician would not be held accountable, and would not have to pay the ticket upon showing the court proof of the emergency. However, the doctor will have lost valuable time getting to the emergency while the officer is writing the ticket.\nThere has been some debate between the California Medical Association (CMA) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) over the necessity of this law. The CHP argues that the law, which was passed in 1954, is outdated and no longer necessary. The CMA argues that in rural areas the law is still needed and could save lives. For now, the law is still on the books and the CMA regularly gives stickers to licensed physicians to use in case of emergencies.",

    "text": "The night before Texas Rowing was to compete in the Big 12 Championship, head coach Carie Graves, an Olympic rower herself, took some time to explain to her Longhorns the physical reality of pushing the body to its limit.\nOf course there\u2019s an equation involving calories burned and calories consumed, but in a seven-minute time trial of leg drives and lactic acid, success can largely be defined by one muscle \u2013 the heart.\nOn Saturday in Oklahoma, the Longhorns displayed theirs in a manner that moved their coach to near tears. UT claimed its fourth-straight Big 12 Conference crown by just one point, the closest margin of victory in the history of the meet.\nUT collected 105 points, followed by rival Oklahoma with 104. Victories by UT\u2019s second varsity four, fourth varsity eight and second varsity eight boats highlighted the Longhorns\u2019 day, but the first varsity eight race is the premier event and awards the most points.\nThe Longhorns fell by nearly 10 seconds to the Sooners at the Longhorn Invitational in March, but at the conference race, with a shuffled lineup, UT pulled within a half-second of the Sooners.\nStill disappointed to finish second, Graves saw a purpose from her boat that had been missing for most of the spring.\nAt the finish line, many of the Longhorns were also reduced to tears. Partly because they felt the agony of defeat, and partly because they finally felt the void of self expenditure. They gave themselves to the boat.\n\u201cIt was their very best effort,\" Graves said.\nGraves challenged her rowers to push to that evil place, to the place of maximum effort and pain. To their credit, the Longhorns did.\nThis race against OU started much like the one on the final day of the Longhorn Invitational on March 18. The Sooners were stronger off the line, forcing UT to play catch-up for the entire race.\nThe difference came in UT\u2019s response. Instead of wilting against a seemingly insurmountable deficit, the Longhorns kept rowing, kept pushing and kept fighting. UT clawed back the entire race and was the stronger boat in the final 250 meters. In fact, had the race been three strokes longer, the Longhorns would have likely won.\nThe record however will show that the Longhorns lost, but that Texas won the team title. And that remains the Longhorns\u2019 victory in defeat.\nWell, that and the notion that they can still get faster. Graves isn\u2019t one to let her rowers be satisfied.",

I started North to South to document our experiences traveling near and far to the places we\u2019ve always dreamed of visiting, and to share those experiences freely with the world \u2013 family, friends, and curious strangers alike.\nI hope you\u2019ll find something of value to you here on North to South. Have a question about a destination we\u2019ve been to? Want to know more about my decision to quit my job to travel the world? I\u2019m an open book, and I\u2019d love to hear from you. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. You can also find me on Facebook and Instagram.\nHere are some random fun facts about me.\nI love adventures, so I\u2019ll try almost anything once.\nI eat vegetarian with the exception of must-try local foods.\nI went to college in sunny, laid-back Malibu.\nI can speak and understand Spanish pretty well.\nI have a dog named Tiger, a playful guy with a big ol\u2019 heart and tiger stripes. My parents were kind enough to give him a home when I started traveling so I still get to hang out with him once in awhile.\nI prefer riding my bike over driving my car. We sold both when we started traveling, but after purchasing our Chicago condo, we both got some vintage road bikes again!\nI don\u2019t watch much TV, but I love Netflix.\nMy favorite foods are orange bell peppers and cheesecake.\nI absolutely hate the cold, but we picked Norway as our first destination.\nI\u2019ve got a fantastic travel companion in my boyfriend fianc\u00e9 husband Ian who shares my passion for travel and trying new things.\nI hate loud noises, but I blast music in the car at nearly full volume.\nMy first time out of the U.S. was on a trip to Spain with my high school Spanish class. I was 17.\nI get antsy being in one place for too long.\nBelow are a few of the common questions posed to us about our exciting journey transitioning from traditional American lives to full time travelers.\nWHAT INSPIRED US TO START TRAVELING?\nAfter each of us struggled to find joy in traditional American full-time jobs, we decided to call it quits and get out and explore the world.\nIn early 2014, the risk of wasting our time and missing out on new experiences finally won us over. It outweighed the risks involved in taking a non-traditional leap out of the regular working world and into the world of travel and entrepreneurship. There were a lot of unanswered questions, but we were confident we\u2019d figure it out.\nWe picked a goal date (March 1, 2014), outlined a plan for our transition, and decided that if we stayed on track and pooled up some extra savings, we\u2019d make the decision official at the beginning of February. After the first week of February, we\u2019d already booked flights and a place to stay for our first month overseas.\nOn March 2, 2014 (our two-year anniversary) we set out on our first adventure destination: the Norwegian fjords around Stord, Norway.\nRead more about our transition from average working Americans to full time travelers (with tips on how you can do it) here: Quit Your Job and Travel The World.\nHOW DO WE PLAN TO GET BY?\nWith our creative entrepreneurship skills, of course!\nYes, we\u2019ve got money in savings, but it\u2019s for emergencies only. A sustainable travel lifestyle is key to our success, so we plan to focus our energy on entrepreneurial endeavors that can be managed from anywhere (as long as there\u2019s Internet access somewhere nearby).

    "text": "At the beginning of the 20th Century, the United States Army was sorely pressed to meet its overseas commitments in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. As a result, in 1901 Congress authorized 5 additional Regular Army Infantry regiments; the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th Infantry. All 5 regiments subsequently served the Army well. The 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry traces its lineage back to when it was first organized on 25 December 1900 in the Regular Army at the Presidio of San Francisco, California, as Company A, 1st Provisional Battalion of Infantry. It was consolidated on 7 February 1901 with Company A, 26th Infantry (which was first constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army), and consolidated unit designated as Company A, 26th Infantry.\nThe 26th Infantry began its life overseas in the Philippines and spent its first 20 years of service on deployments to the Southwest Pacific, the Mexican and Indian frontier and in Europe. It earned its first battle streamer during the Philippine Insurrection within 2 years of its forming as a unit.\nAfter returning to the same location for another tour of duty (a habit the 26th Infantry Regiment would keep for the entire century), the 26th Infantry Regiment fought off Mexican bandits and settled disputes in the Indian Territory until it was selected as one of only 4 Regular Army Infantry Regiments deemed fit for immediate combat to form the 1st American Expeditionary Division in June of 1917. This expeditionary division would later be redesignated the 1st Division (and subsequently the 1st Infantry Division) and thus began ths 26th Infantry Regiment's long association with the Big Red One.\nAs part of the first American soldiers to arrive in France, the 26th Infantry Regiment immediately left for the front. Along with its sister regiments of the 1st Division, it earned more campaign streamers than any other regiments during the First World War, but at a terrible cost. Over 900 members of the Regiment their lives in a 6-month period. At Soisson alone, the regimental commander, executive officer, 2 of 3 battalion commanders and regimental sergeant major were killed in action. Sixty-two officers were killed or wounded and out of 3100 men that started the attack, over 1500 had been killed or wounded. The battle was won and this turned the tide for the Allies at a crucial period during the summer of 1918. By war's end, the soldiers earned 7 battle streamers and 2 foreign awards. It was also during this conflict that the Regiment's name, the \"Blue Spaders\" came into usage. The name referred to the Regimental shield, which consisted of the Mohawk arrowhead. Colonel Hamilton A. Smith selected this to represent the regimental spirit of courage, resourceful daring and relentless pursuit of an enemy.\nFollowing a brief occupation duty in Germany, the regiment returned to the United States and served as a part of a smaller peacetime Army until 1941. In the 1920s and 30s, the unit's permanent home station became Plattsburg Barracks, New York. These years would involve training exercises and maneuvers along with the normal routines of garrison duty.\nIn 1941, the regiment once again stood with its sister regiments and prepared for war in Europe. In World War II, the 26th Infantry led America's first-ever amphibious assault in North Africa, fought at the Kasserine Pass, assaulted Sicily, invaded Normandy, conquered the first German city of the war at Aachen, vaulted the Rhine and attacked all the way to Czechoslovakia by war's end. The 26th Infantry Regiment conducted 3 amphibious assaults, and earned 7 battle streamers, a Presidential Unit Citation, and 5 foreign awards.\nBeginning another occupation of Germany, the \"Blue Spaders\" were given the honor of bearing the United States National Colors at the Allied Victory in Europe parade, and were selected to serve as America's guard of honor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. Thus began a lengthy stay in Germany, first as conquerors and later as friends and Allies.\nThe unit was reorganized and redesignated on 15 February 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battle Group, 26th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 1st Infantry Division with its organic elements concurrently constituted and activated. It was relieved on 14 April 1959 from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division and assigned to the 8th Infantry Division.\nServing as a battle group in Europe in the early 1960s, the unit was attached to various Divisions. It was relieved on 24 October 1962 from assignment to the 8th Infantry Division and assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division. It was relieved on 15 February 1963 from assignment to the 2nd Infantry Division and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division. It was then reorganized and redesignated on 13 January 1964 as the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry.\nThe Battalion rejoined the 1st Infantry Division shortly before receiving orders to deploy as a part of the Army's first divisional-sized unit in Vietnam in 1965. The \"Blue Spaders\" served longer in Vietnam with their \"Big Red One\" units than any other division. After 5 continuous years of combat the \"Blue Spaders\" received orders to return home in 1970 with 11 battle streamers, a Valorous Unit Award and 2 foreign awards for its colors.\nAt the conclusion of Vietnam, the Battalion returned to Germany as part of a forward-deployed brigade of the 1st Infantry Division. The unit was inactivated on 24 February 1983 in Germany and relieved from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division, when that Brigade returned to the United States.\nThe 26th Infantry was transfered to TRADOC on 3 April 1987, where the 26th Infantry's Regiments spent several years training recruits. The 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry was inactivated on 15 January 1996 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and withdrawn from the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command.\nOn 16 February 1996, the Battalion rejoined the \"Big Red One\" in Germany only to send its soldiers to Bosnia as part of the first American forces to enter the Balkans from February to September 1996. The entire Battalion followed its initial deployment from October 1996 to April 1997. In March 1998, the \"Blue Spaders\" deployed again to the Balkans, this time to the Republic of Macedonia. Returning briefly in September 1998, the Battalion was the first unit alerted for deployment to Kosovo in June 1999. It returned in December 1999. During this period, the unit earned the Superior Unit Award streamer and the Defense of Kosovo streamer for the colors. Three of Task Force 1-26 Infantry's soldiers lost their lives in Kosovo.\nIn 2004 the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry deployed with other elements of the 1st Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Following that deployment the unit was redesignated on 1 October 2005 as the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment.\nAfter serving another tour of duty in Iraq in 2007, the unit was relieved on 16 March 2008 from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division and assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. This was part of the transformation of the 2nd Brigade to the US Army's modular force structure. 3rd Brigade Combat Team had perviously converted in 2006 and the 2nd Battalion, 26th Infantry was concurrently inactivated and reflagged as the 1st battalion, 26th Infantry.\nIn June 2008 the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, including the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry, deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit remained deployed in that country into 2009.",

    "text": "Red Hood and the Outlaws is an underdog book about a group of underdogs, and I'm not really surprised DC Comics keeps giving it second changes, through \"DC You\" and into \"Rebirth.\" The concept is sound (filling a space in the DC Universe previously held by books like Outsiders and Secret Six), and Scott Lobdell, I thought, wrote Red Hood, Arsenal, and Starfire well in this book's beginnings. Though indeed there were questionable choices in how the book handled Starfire especially, I think some of this book's worse reputation came from confusing the unseriousness of the characters (especially Arsenal, which was largely an act) with the book itself. In depicting a group of troubled superheroes with no one but one another, Lobdell succeeded.\nRed Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 4: League of Assassins is the first volume absent both Lobdell and original artist Kenneth Rocafort, now with James Tynion and Julius Gopez. Tynion has going for the book a strong understanding of the relationship between the Outlaws, and a storyline that authentically puts that to the test. At the same time, this long storyline gets overcomplicated, with lots of mystic gobbledegook, and Tynion gets wrong some of what Lobdell established earlier.\nBut also tellingly, Tynion's best issue here is the one not drawn by Gopez. Though there's nothing egregiously wrong, the book's art is routinely inked too darkly and the characters' appearances are inconsistent from one issue to the next. This looks like a generic superhero book, far especially from Rocafort, and it might be another reason Red Hood and the Outlaws doesn't get its respect.\nFrom the outset, Tynion's League of Assassins is a story about Arsenal Roy Harper trying to keep the Outlaws together after a traumatized, amnesic Red Hood Jason Todd departs, and Tynion's got that heart of the story right. Roy acts desperately, almost pathetically, but he's meant to be a pathetic figure, recognizing rightly that Jason and Starfire Koriand'r's friendship is the best thing in his life. Outlaws is a story of co-dependence; the characters are great for one another because they're so bad for one another. Tynion smartly develops a plot that puts Jason, Roy, and Kori on three different sides of a war, momentarily pitted against one another, and that's an excellent dynamic four volumes into their time together.\nTynion also does well in establishing two other important relationships for Roy Harper. In the uncertain rollout of the New 52, what time Roy spent with Green Arrow wasn't quite clear. It's been expanded on a bit in flashback late in the Green Arrow series, but here Tynion has them on the page together perhaps for the first time and writes their dysfunctional dynamic well (I also like Tynion's invention of the \"Roybots\" security). Second, Tynion pits Roy against Cheshire, the mother of his child in other continuities; I thought Tynion portrayed Cheshire as too flip in the beginning, but she evens out and we see hints of what she and Roy might actually see in one another before the book is through.\nI give Tynion credit for a long story (eight issues and an annual) and indeed it actually continues on into the next book. The book doesn't even feel decompressed -- I don't mind a long story one can sink their teeth into -- as that Tynion's motivations for the characters comes off strained. There's a bounty out to kill the Outlaws, which we learn was set by the mystic group the Untitled, ultimately for no good reason than to \"keep [the characters] on [their] feet,\" which is nonsense if the Untitled needed the Outlaws alive. Meanwhile the League of Assassins mean to recruit Jason to lead them even despite his amnesia and for reasons never wholly clear. And various characters -- the rival organization All-Caste's Ducra and Essence, and Ra's al Ghul -- have different plans, revealed and not, that contribute to the book's central jumble.\nFurther, Lobdell had established that a seeming war between the Untitled and the All-Caste had actually been started by the character Essence within the All-Caste; Tynion reverses this and makes the war really the Untitled's fault. Again, it's a lot of mystic back-and-forth, but the result is that Tynion takes something that had nuance and wasn't what it seemed, and instead makes it very plain without shades of gray. To be sure, this was one mystic group too many even under Lobdell, unlikely to be seen or heard from again in the DC Universe, but I'd have preferred that Tynion built on what Lobdell established (which admittedly he does to a great extent) than to change it.\nTynion cleverly accommodates the book's tie-in with the Batman: Zero Year storyline, leading into a flashback just before that issue. The tie-in issue, with art by Constantine's Jeremy Haun, is among the strongest in the book and also better than most Zero Year tie-ins in that Tynion actually delves into Zero Year's Red Hood mystery, maybe suggesting a thing or two. Notably, we can now say that Jason Todd was a \"Red Hood\" before he ever encountered the Joker; though not explicit, we kind of understand why Jason chose that moniker now. We also see some of Jason and Talia al Ghul's relationship and why Talia might have brought Jason back from the dead. This whole book needs more Talia, frankly; I guess Talia is dead when this book is set, but her death isn't remarked on clearly enough for the audience to understand what's at stake for the League of Assassins and Ra's al Ghul as regards what plans Talia has in motion.\nRed Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 4: League of Assassins offers a glimpse of this title not written by Scott Lobdell, and the fact that it's more or less viable suggests good things for the characters going forward. The fact that Lobdell gets the title back in a few volumes, and keeps it through \"DC You\" and into the new \"Rebirth\" iteration, is just icing on the cake. This is not Red Hood and the Outlaws at its best, but even so it demonstrates the complex characters that have kept the title going as long as it has.\nI always found this series to be incredibly overrated. It never felt like the writer ever had any sort of direction for these characters, he just threw stuff at the wall, and then pivoted depending on audience reaction. And the constant exposition gets really grating. Yes, we can see that Red Hood's pointing a gun at Superman. We don't need every character to say that Red Hood's pointing a gun at Superman.\nI thought of Red Hood and the Outlaws as something of a pallet cleanser after reading a few heavier dramatic titles. It always had at least semi decent story lines and it had flawed characters that helped each other grow because they needed someone else to lean on.\nWhile not being top level writing, all writers of the series (there are 3, I almost forgot Will Pfeifer who wrote a few issues that are printed in volume 5) make sure that it's the characters you care about even if the story gets a small dip in quality.\nAnd while I'm not going to spoil anything of future volumes, I want to address your comment about it looking good for DC You. They completely changed the tone in the Red Hood/Arsenal title, more in the art than in the writing, it really feels like some bad editorial decisions being forced on it. It does get better and when the story reaches Robin War this seems to be completely gone. The Starfire title was something I couldn't read, the first issue was something my girlfriend enjoys (who is in her early 20s) and seems to have the humor of some of the \"high school\" shows she watches on youth channels.",

    "text": "Lynn Rives stands in front of the new sign bearing his name that hangs on the Environmental Education Center at the Mobbly Bayou Wilderness Preserve.\nFor nearly 20 years, Lynn Rives served as Oldsmar\u2019s leisure services director, where he was responsible for such projects as the creation of Canal Park and its renovated Supercross track, the growth of Oldsmar\u2019s expansive parks and trails system, and the construction of the Environmental Education Center at Mobbly Bayou Preserve .\nDespite his extensive list of accomplishments, officials rejected a request by City Council member Jerry Beverland to name a city facility in Rives\u2019 honor prior to his retirement last March, a decision that sat just fine with the designated honoree.\n\u201cI told (Jerry) I really wasn\u2019t interested in it anyway,\u201d Rives said in January of 2017.\nFlash-forward a year and Rives is still alive and well; in fact, he\u2019s currently serving as the City Manager of his hometown, Belleair Beach.\nHowever, after being gone for 12 months, Oldsmar officials decided the time was right to officially name the center after Rives.\nThe City of Oldsmar dedicated the Environmental Education Center at Mobbly Bayou Preserve in honor of longtime Leisure Services Director Lynn Rives, who retired in 2017 after nearly 20 years with the city.\n\u201cThe City of Oldsmar likes to consider ourselves on the leading edge where we name things after people before they pass away,\u201d City Manager Al Braithwaite joked to open the dedication ceremony on Monday, Mar. 12.\nBraithwaite then handed the microphone to Oldsmar Mayor Doug Bevis who listed several notable accomplishments from Rives\u2019 tenure, which began in September 1999, including: opening the original Oldsmar BMX track and converting it into an Olympic-caliber Supercross facility; developing Richard Rogers Park, the Cypress Forest Recreation Center and Veterans Memorial Park; and opening Mobbly Bayou Wilderness Preserve, which includes a dog park, a zipline aerial adventure park and the Environmental Education Center.\n\u201cThis building was erected in 2016 under his supervision and includes a solar panel on the roof that helped achieve one of the many council priorities he was given,\u201d Bevis said of the facility, which he called \u201ca major undertaking\u201d that included hoisting the hefty wooden beams that support the roof into place.\nOldsmar Mayor Doug Bevis notes the heavy wooden beams that make up the Environmental Education Center ceiling during the facility\u2019s dedication ceremony in Lynn Rives\u2019 honor on Monday, Mar. 12, 2018.\n\u201cProbably with the exception of the concrete work and the beams being set in here, our city staff did this entire project. So congratulations to Lynn and his staff for pulling that off.\nBevis concluded by saying \u201cthank you to Lynn for the numerous other projects he spearheaded to help put our city on the map where it is today\u201d before he directed the group to the front of the facility for the unveiling of the sign.\nFollowing the reveal, Rives spoke about receiving the (slightly delayed) honor.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. It\u2019s a very nice thing to do and I really appreciate it,\u201d he told Oldsmar Connect.\nOldsmar officials dodge flying metal clips during the unveiling of the sign dedicating the Lynn Rives Environmental Education Center on Monday, Mar. 12, 2018.\nDespite his initial reluctance to have something named after him, Rives admitted it was special to see his name on this facility.\nBraithwaite and Rives\u2019 successor, Felicia Donnelly, also commented after the ceremony.\n\u201cHe is an amazing go-getter,\u201d Braithwaite, who started his career with the city at the same time as Rives, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone who gets things done as well as he does.",

A small brown mammal with plate-like scales rustles through the grass. Little does it know that it walks close to the path of extinction.\nThere hasn\u2019t been a more dangerous time to be a pangolin. The species has become the most trafficked mammal in the world. They are illegally traded for their scales, as bush meat or for medicinal purposes. But the threat of their extinction rarely makes news. An organisation in Zimbabwe aims to change this by educating the public about an animal many may not know even exists. Enabled by the Tikki Hywood Trust, a group of men dedicate their lives to rehabilitating captured pangolins. They are entrusted with caring for animals that have endured major stress, often having been transported many kilometres bound in a sack, starved and dehydrated.\nThe process takes a lot of patience. It is a difficult task to gain the trust of the pangolins while trying to nurture them to full health. But the men do this with love for the animal. They have developed an intimate relationship while caring for them. Pangolins are like their children. And like any parent, they will protect their family from anything that poses a threat.",

    "text": "It's practically summertime so there are lots and lots of movies opening soon. One of these is The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 which opens on June 12. It's about guys who hijack New York subway train Pelham 123, hold people hostage, demand money, and escape - but how?. One regular transit dispatcher guy ends up involved. The movie stars famous people (Denzel Washington and John Travolta) and the trailers make it look really exciting and action-y. I'd sort of thought of trying to see it when it comes out, if it got good reviews.\nAnd this is a good heist movie - actually, it's a good movie, period. It's suspenseful and engrossing, with some comic moments thrown to ease the tension. It was interesting to see how the hijackers used their knowledge of the New York subway system and its trains to pull off the job. If you're going to do any kind of heist, it's important to know just how everything works, yes?\nThe main question throughout is how the hijackers are going to escape and get away with the job. I'm not going to tell you whether they succeed or how it ends - even though the movie has been remade, I don't know whether they'll use the exact same story. They've already changed the title (words representing numbers are so old-fashioned; why not just the numbers instead?) and I hope that they don't change the actual story too much. Being the age that it is, I expect that they'll not only modernize the story to reflect the updated technology, but also add some new twists and turns and stunts. Maybe even an explosion or two.\nAs long the remake stays a heist movie, it'll probably be ok.\nI agree it will be interesting to see the remake. I enjoyed Robert Shaw. He does such a great villain. Did you notice the young Doris Roberts as thle mayor's wife. A real classic.",

I read online that I\u2019d have to wait 30-60 minutes to let this radioactive sugar get absorbed. So I brought a list of phone calls I had to make. Sidenote: if you\u2019re ever diagnosed with cancer make sure to get unlimited minutes. I\u2019ve never been on the phone so much in my life. Anyway, he tells me I can text but not speak. Then he mentions that besides not nursing Naomi for 24 hours (no, she still has never taken a bottle), I can\u2019t TOUCH or hold my children for more than 30 second increments. For 4-5 hours. By the way, is it 4 or 5? I went with 4.5 hours. Of torture.\nNaomi was hysterical when I got home and all I could do was look at her. She normally has 2 naps by then but had only slept for 30 minutes. Hadn\u2019t eaten a thing. I couldn\u2019t find the best sippy cup we have and searched everywhere. Finally, I prayed for 10 seconds, then walked back to where they were. She stopped crying. I looked over, and there was the sippy cup (in one of Abi\u2019s toy bins). Then she took the sippy cup with milk for longer than ever from my dad. My baby girl passed out for 3.5 hours after this.\nI expect the night to be the worst part, because she nurses so much. But at dinner she miraculously took a bunch of milk from a tablespoon, and after a stroller ride she fell asleep without nursing. Very little crying. This early and sudden weaning was one of my biggest concerns of the entire cancer deal. Praise God from whom all blessings flow! He is still around and still faithful.",

But by Tuesday night's drawing, officials estimate that 75 per cent will be sold.\nThat would mean a 25 per cent chance of no winner. If that happens, it's likely even more combinations would be covered before the next drawing three days later. Officials don't have an estimate on how many tickets would be sold for that potential drawing, and they haven't said how large the estimated prize would be. Could it reach $2 billion?\nIf the odds of winning either Mega Millions or Powerball don't seem gigantic enough, how about winning them both? Spend $4 on a ticket for each game and it could happen. But the odds aren't especially favourable, at about 1 in 88 quadrillion (that's 88,000,000,000,000,000).\nFor Mega Millions, players choose six numbers: five from a range of white balls, numbered 1 to 70, and one number for the Mega Ball, with a range of 1 to 25. What numbers have come up most? Since 2010, that honour goes to the number 2, with 92 hits, followed by the numbers 20, 11, 31 and 17. The most hit Mega Ball number is 9.",

Green Tea has been shown to prevent the damage associated with skin cancer, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Tea polyphenols have natural astringent, toning, soothing, and anti-inflammatory properties and prevent the enzymes that attack and break down your body's natural production of collagen and elastase.\nA water soluble surfactant derived from Coconut.\nBehind every great lather is a great surfactant. Unlike many shampoos, ours is naturally derived (from coconut) and gives a luxurious lather while offering excellent cleansing and moisturizing properties.\nA combination of antimicrobial peptides, Lactobacillus works to rid of harmful bacteria and stimulate the production of good bacteria on your skin.\nThis humectant prevents moisture loss while balancing and soothing the scalp.\nA surfactant derived from apples, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids conditions the skin.\nEmollient, nutritive and rich in antioxidants, this oil actually dissolves the oil complex that holds dead skin cells together. Part exfoliant, part lubricant, it reduces flaking and improves texture.\nDerived from the seeds of the Limnanthes alba, Meadowfoam Seed Oil's long chain fatty acid structure and waxy texture gives it great barrier function, allowing it to lock in moisture and hydrate the hair. Additionally, Meadowfoam functions as a powerful antioxidant, protecting your hair from UV damage.\nCitric acid helps to preserve a formula by preventing the growth of bacteria. Although it can be obtained from a variety of sources, ours is derived from non-GMO cassava root.\nThis light, naturally fresh blend of whole essential oils was created exclusively for True Botanicals by one of the oldest fragrance houses in the world and incorporates lemon, orange, mimosa, violet, and ylang ylang.\nRetaining the moisturizing properties of the coconut oil from which it is derived, Decyl Glucoside is a surfactant that also works to moisturize, smooth, and soften the skin.",

    "text": "In the silence, things are revealed.\nThings that cannot be heard in the noise of modern life.\nFor the most part, our culture fears silence because of its revelatory power, both good and bad. We do have so many secrets.\nUsually, the first thing us humans encounter in the silence is our thoughts. So we fear the silence because, we fear our own thoughts. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? The pesky ones we try so hard to push away are usually the first to surface.\nThat\u2019s a drag, so instead we block out the silence. We come home, we go to the fridge and we turn on the tv. We push our consciousness through a kind of predictable tunnel. And the tunnel has a weight, a momentum that is hard to break.\nIt takes a big experience like falling in love or the loss of a loved one to crack open the tunnel. But the thing is, no matter how life altering the experience, we have an uncanny way of eventually finding our way back to the tunnel where things are safe, warm and pretty doggone mediocre. Well, lately, mediocrity is even giving the tunnel too much credit. We\u2019ve sunk somewhere below mediocrity into absurdity.\nThen every once-in-awhile, in the silence you recognize an exciting thought that leads you down the rabbit hole. It stirs something within you, like the memory of a distant voice. Maybe it is hardly a voice at all and more like a feeling. It stirs you to action. Maybe you write it down. Maybe you make a collage. Maybe you fix something. Maybe you share your idea with another. Maybe you make the bed.\nOr maybe you just shut up and listen. And then respond. Listen. Respond. You begin to have a conversation with what is. In the silence, our senses unfurl, like tendrils. We hear the wind. Bird. We smell the air, and perhaps notice that when the sun comes out for a moment from behind the clouds on a grayish day, the grass responds to the sun by releasing a stronger scent. Smell the greeting of the grass and the sun.\nIt is all so alive.\nIn the silence, one can slip into the role of the third person who watches. From that perspective, when someone, let\u2019s say, cuts you off in traffic, you become frustrated for a moment, sure. You are yanked back down to a lower consciousness. But if you\u2019ve been practicing as the watcher, you are more easily able to slip back into higher consciousness.\nI don\u2019t mean to imply that the higher consciousness is a way to avoid emotion. You feel the anger but in the silence, you more easily and quickly move to another place, like finding shade on a hot day. Why stay hot when the shade is right next to you?\nMaybe to be enlightened means that you live in that higher consciousness all the time, or, I don\u2019t know, 90% of the time. Those people, from what I\u2019ve heard, have had some kind of major divine intervention. For most of us poor schmucks it\u2019s just something we have to practice. It\u2019s hard for a beginner like me and very time consuming, but also cleansing, like a good poop.\n\u201cAnd one should never underestimate the satisfaction of a good poop, I always say,\u201d says Mr. Octopus, who is, pretty much, enlightened.\nIt\u2019s called higher consciousness because it lifts you higher. Duh! Sort of like being high, but with better side affects.\nAnd I suspect there\u2019s more to the silence than even all of that. It\u2019s exciting. But for now, this is as far as I\u2019ve gotten.\nSo, what the hell? Turn off that tv once-in-awhile. Turn off that radio. Let the emptiness emerge and let the quiet part begin! Whoop whoop! The secrets are not as bad as we think. The truth is always better, even though its emergence is sometimes painful.\n\u201cLike a poop,\u201d says Mr. Octopus.\n\u201cYes, just like a hard poop,\u201d I agree.\nIn silence we can hear the truth of ourselves, and, well, it\u2019s not all bad! Geesh!\nThis entry was posted on Monday, December 13th, 2010 at 3:16 pm\tand posted in Favorites, Uncategorized.\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.",

Just look at the schedule below- and try not to wince.\nIf there was one thing I'd suggest Ford to change, it's that 6 am breakfast call. So does that mean Babushka went without? JU SO FONII!! My Cuban appetite is such a trooper; it ordered a made for BB omelette along with plates of fruit and pastries- and that was before the first cafe.\nAt 7:15 am Babushka and the rest of the zombies (BB refuses to believe anyone is awake at this time) head to the conference center. Here we have more cafe waiting for us. Viste?? Babushka's not the only one who saw the zombie resemblance.\nA las 8:15 a.m., in hopes that we're now awake, we officially start the day and are welcomed by Ford's Executive Chairman.\nBill Ford- William Clay Ford Jr.\nBill is the great-grandson of Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone. Si, THE Ford and Firestone. With that kind of lineage sabes that he's gotta know a thing or two about carros. And he does, mixing tales of the future with anecdotes of the past, he was knowledgeable and entertaining; he did his tatarabuelos proud.\nSheryl's job is finding the pulse behind consumer's wants and then trying to predict what would start that pulse a racing. Being a lawyer, artist, and mother gives her the multi faceted vision to do the job right, and Babushka cheered her speeches and her chutzpah.\nIf you notice, there were some pretty big names there. In BB's world we'd say it was an all star cast, but you know what? They weren't reciting Shakespeare. No My Beautifuls, they were talking terms and temas Babushka could follow. True, I didn't attend the #FordTech session (not surprisingly it wasn't picked by my test score) but something tells me it would have been the same. Not only did BB's eyes not glaze over as they usually do when they start with car lingo, Babushka was so inspired by the #FordDesign panel that instead of questioning them I thanked them for their contributions- and for keeping it real. What can I say? BB was bursting with Plebian Pride; this was a car conference one could follow, learn, and contribute to.\n\"The future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed.\"\nThe story is what is being sold. The challenge is figuring how to matter. Do this with a story.\nBabushka was writing this post very late and by mistake erased all her pics. Hopefully they're still in my old laptop (which needs to be repaired upon my return to Tallahassee) and I will continue with the tale of the conference. The pics are of the fab \"Felicidades Mustang on turning 50!\" fiesta, the test drives on Ford vehicles (chills & thrills), and helping a neighborhood garden by driving a new, grande, gorgeous Ford truck with supplies. Oh yes BB did!!\nSomething Babushka also did; BB also realized that it's not enough to say we'd like to \"make a difference\". WE are that difference. It doesn't matter your profession, your social status, your monetary situation, ALL of us are part of the greater good. We are part of this global world, and EVERYONE is family. What part of your family history would you like to tell? Where are the stories sharing your passions and beliefs? As shown in past posts, sometimes it takes a major life event to help us find our voice. Have you found your story, your voice?\nThe S Sisters brought advocacy and global responsibility events to BB, and in the next post I'll share with you My Beautifuls the story they were preparing me to tell.\nLabels: family of man, Ford Motor Company, global family, global responsibility, Harvey Firestone, Henry Ford, making a difference, Seth Godin, Sheryl Connelly, storytelling, William Clay Ford Jr.",

I am interested in an individual only being able to check files out of the vault to a secured location and not being able to transfer files to another unsecured location. Can this restricted access be applied to a computer with a hard drive or is a terminal required for the level of security?\nWhen a user checks out a file, they are not really checking it out to another location, in the sense of copying it to a different drive. It's true that the PDM system copies the file from the vault to the user's 'local cache', but it only appears to them as a file in their vault view, and as such it is still under the control of EPDM.\nAs far as them copying and pasting files to other locations outside of the vault, AFAIK there's no way to prevent it (as a function of Windows, not EPDM) without the use of third party software.

This piling on top of NAO, PAC, Deloitte, Gray, Chilcot, and others\u2019 damning inquiry evidence has stung at least some senior officials to acknowledge that MOD is in a real mess. But, even now, most officials remain in denial as to the magnitude of the problem - which is nothing short of a national scandal, requiring more fundamental change than envisaged in the scope of the Liam Fox, Lord Levene, and Bernard Gray reform processes under way.\nSubmission to the \u2018Public Administration Select Committee\u2019 - November 2011?\nNo-one is even mentioning the possible security implications of the current economic crisis - which are potentially huge. Governments could fall \u2013 and indeed are doing so.\nHopefully, we will not have a 21st century Kreditanstaldt banking collapse event that leads to a new turbocharged Great Depression. However, Mervyn King, Max Hastings, and others are right to warn us that events could get that bad \u2013 and Citigroup\u2019s chief economist Willem Butler\u2019s recent warning to a parliamentary committee that \u2018if things get out of hand in the euro area no bank in the financial-integrated world will stand\u2019 may well be a prescient warning. Even the best scenario - seemingly 5-10 years of Japanese-style stagnation will test us to new levels.\nMany recognise this as the No 1 threat - so we might expect that the National Security Council (NSC) has discussed it, and ensured that the right contingency planning and 'due diligence' work is going on - not detracting from the main effort of doing everything to avoid catastrophe, but 'just in case'.",

Thanks in advance!\nOf course this has been discussed in some length by many people. I have even posted some opinions. A search for shocks, or specific shocks would be wise.\nRegardless, it depends on what you\u2019re going to use the truck for. I prefer a mono-tube gas shock over a straight hydraulic and think that the Bilstein 5100, for an off the shelf shock, is the best value for the best of both worlds, on road and off road. Others will argue that. In my opinion, a mono-tube gas shock is built superior to a straight hydraulic shock and usually, this includes the valving.\nsteakman and GTO_Gregory like this.\nI am looking at putting KYB Monomaxes on rig. Its another one to look for.\nLast edited by dz302; 07-14-2017 at 12:01 PM.\nI just purchased Bilstein 4600 shocks for my 03 LB7 and a Bilstein Steering Stabilizer from shock ware house and got 5% off by being a member on here.\nLooking for another CCSB 4X4 D/A..\nEvery Bilstein I've ever put on my 2500 and 3500 trucks, all stock height, have pounded the lower shock bushing out, in less than 10k miles. **** Bilstein.\nMy Bilsteins have 182K on them and I've only replaced the lower bushings once. I did extend the shock mounts though so the shock wasn't stopping the A-arm from dropping all the way down.\nDon't argue with an idiot, the people watching may not be able to tell you two apart.\nLast edited by dozerboy; 01-07-2018 at 09:51 PM.\nAnd I thought I was the only one. I'll replace with OEM when it warms up.\n2016 Chevrolet 2500 LML, CCSB, 4WD, Stock.\nThe Raped Ape -2006 GMC 2500 LBZ, CCSB, 4WD, EFI Live w/mild tune, injectors @160k miles, head gaskets at 190k, , Superglide Hitch, otherwise stock.\nFox 2.0's.

Once on the train, I chatted briefly with Laura (France) who mistook me for someone she had met in SE Asia.\nI didn't sleep as well this second time, so it was a nice surprise to receive what seemed to be a reasonable quote for a rickshaw ride to Taj Ganj, the tourist area directly south of the Taj Mahal. The first view of India's iconic mausoleum resulted in another \u201cwow\u201d moment for me. After checking out a few hotels, I settled on a room in the same place as Laura and Dan (England). Strong winds whipped up sand, and rain soon followed, thus postponing our plans for a rooftop dinner overlooking the Taj at sunset.\nThe paint was peeling off the ceiling in my hotel room. At first I saw it as a charming detail, however after waking up the next day in a bed covered with flaking paint, I found it less appealing. I also learned that a vent in the wall does not constitute air-conditioning.\nWow, I can\u2019t wait to read your post about Taj Mahal. I\u2019m already impressed with the photos!\nHopefully it wasn\u2019t lead paint!!\nYeah, I was amazed at how the cheap backpacker style accommodations had amazing rooftop views of the Taj Mahal. Try and and find that around the Eiffel Tower, Empire State Buliding, or Big Ben!\nWow impressive pictures of the Taj. Any plans to go to Golden Temple in Amritsar?\nHey Stefan\u2026there are SO many places I\u2019d like to go in northern India that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go to any \u2013 just head for SE Asia as time is a tickin\u2019.\nPlaces I\u2019d easily come back to see in just northern India include: Amritsar, Chandigarh, Manali, Leh/Ladakh, Rishikesh. And that doesn\u2019t even touch the rest of India.\nUgh, peeling paint!!! We lived in El Shito Appartmento when we were in Chicago (before we left the landlord was fined and forced to close at least one of his apartments by the city!) and the paint on the pipes over our heads regularly flaked off as the water condenced on the outside of them and dripped onto our bed. We\u2019d have moved the bed but the room was too small!\nAt least you won\u2019t have to be tehre for long!",

We will help your C-Suite team build a strong team identity and cohesion around norms for effectively working together, aligning vision and strategy.\nIt is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d you will need to replace your leader, it is \u201cwhen.\u201d Having a succession plan in place is not just a good idea, it is the responsible thing to do.\nBEATTY works with CEOs and boards to identify potential leaders within your company and initiates coaching that will prepare them for expanding roles and responsibilities.\nWhen hiring or promoting an executive to the C-Suite level, you owe it to yourself and your company to make the most informed decision possible. Subjective interviews are just that \u2013 subjective. With BEATTY, results are statistically reliable and valid.\nWe use a comprehensive assessment battery that takes into account job-related personality characteristics, leadership style, and problem - solving ability. It is designed to shine a light on hidden potential \u2013 and expose shortcomings \u2013 that could profoundly impact a candidate\u2019s likelihood of success.\nSometimes our assessment determines that the \u201cobvious choice\u201d is actually ill - suited for the promotion at hand but could be an ideal candidate for another critical position within the company. Instead of being primed for failure, the individual becomes a critical asset to the company \u2013 a win/win.\nYou have recruited top talent for your leadership team. But have you created an environment that allows team members to feed off of each other\u2019s creativity and talents? BEATTY can teach your team how to work more synergistically.\nIt is important to remember that team building is essential if your goal is to grow and retain top talent. Teambuilding can also play a role in identifying and grooming leaders as part of CEO succession planning.\nWe begin by understanding your company\u2019s business and culture as well as the roles of the different team members. Our Leadership Team Survey focuses on the team\u2019s purpose, identity, talent, climate, generative thinking and self-regulation. Once the core strengths and key development opportunities of the team have been identified, BEATTY facilitates an off-site retreat engaging the team in candid dialogue around its current and desired state. The objective is to create a compelling team identity relative to mission and vision, as well as \u201crules of engagement\u201d for working effectively together. The ultimate goal is to align the executive team with the organization\u2019s business and strategic objectives.\nPerhaps the most beneficial aspect of the BEATTY teambuilding approach is that it not only strengthens the team unit but also enhances the performance of the individual executives.\nAs Good As You Are, We Can Make You Even Better.\nThrough our developmental coaching, BEATTY equips executives to meet the challenges of their business roles. Our process is tailored specifically to your industry and the needs of your company. We also are intentional in partnering with representatives from your human resources and organization development functions.\nDevelopmental coaching with BEATTY provides a safe, caring environment in which to try out new behaviors, practice new skills and receive frank, constructive feedback. We start with the same comprehensive assessment battery that we use for selection assessment, which takes into account job-related personality characteristics, leadership style, and problem-solving ability.\nIn consultation with the executive and his/her manager, we develop a customized action strategy specifying measurable goals and realistic timelines.",

Aceable has made a guide to the DMV and the drivers licenses process.\nWhat the Department of Motor Vehicles is called varies heavily by State. In Florida, it's the FLHSMV, the Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, while in Ohio it's the BMV, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. But the acronym that is most used in pop culture is the DMV.\nThe DMV can be a tricky place with all of its paperwork, lines and the weirdly placed DMV office locations. We here at Aceable have made a guide to make understanding the DMV and the process of getting your drivers licenses easier. A guide on how to find the DMV office nearest to you. We also have practice tests for your drivers permit test and practice tests for drivers licenses test. Plus guides for less common but very important topics such as changing your name on your license or changing your gender on your license. We hope all of this DMV info helps!\nWe wrote guides to explain the various services that the California DMV offers, such as getting your drivers licenses, and registering or replacing your lost registration. We also wrote guides on changing your gender on your CA license and how to register to be an organ donor.\nTexas actually has both a DMV and a DPS. The Texas DMV, Department of Motor Vehicles, is in charge of vehicles. Meaning that they issue registrations and titles for your car. The Texas DPS, Department of Public Safety is in charge of public safety. That means that they issues drivers licenses and permits as well as enforce the rules of the road. We wrote guides to help navigate between these two agencies.\nThe Nevada DMV handles everything to do with the road. From issuing driver's licenses and driver's licenses tests to vehicle registration and title. The Nevada DMV is pretty technologically advanced, you can actually use a kiosk for most renewals.\nIn Florida the DMV is actually called the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, FLHSMV for short. It serves the same role that a DMV in any other state serves. It Issues your license or permit, registers your vehicle, and handles almost anything car or driving related in Florida. Including changing your name and gender on your license.\nThe Ohio BMV, Bureau of Motor Vehicles, is the same as the DMV, Department of Motor Vehicles, in any other state. It\u2019s the place to be when you need to replace, renew or get your license. As well as the place for anything related to vehicle title and car registration.\nHow many questions are on the DMV learners permit test?\nCan I take a free permit practice test?\nHow do you change your gender on your driver license?",

    "text": "Some days I wonder if wedding banquets in Singapore, especially the traditional Chinese sit-down dinner is for the married couple or for the married couple\u2019s parents. You know what I mean, in a room of 40 tables, 15 tables are for the bride\u2019s extended family, 15 tables are for the groom\u2019s extended family. The remaining tables are either for friends of the bride and groom or to put relatives that no one really wants to acknowledge. Like that weird uncle who\u2019s starting to look more and more like his possessed Chihuahua.\nNo matter what your guest arrangement, you\u2019ll need to find a hotel that provides a wedding package that fits your needs, including your budget. Here is a summary of how much a wedding banquet will cost you this year.\nDon\u2019t expect most of the wedding invitations you receive this year to be held at luxury hotels. While Singaporeans don\u2019t seem to have a problem paying about $1200 per table, prices per table have gone up so sharply in the past few years that $1200 is now on the low end.\nIf you\u2019re okay with picking a hotel that\u2019s a little off the beaten track, then exchange convenience for comfort with a 4 Star hotel. Do note that, generally speaking, these hotels have a higher requirement for the minimum number of tables you can request for.\nThough there aren\u2019t too many 3 Star hotels that provide wedding packages, you\u2019re definitely going to save by holding your wedding at one of these hotels.\nOther than resorting to a 3 Star hotel, how do you get yourself a lower table rate?\nThere are many benefits to having a wedding banquet at a hotel, like enjoying a complimentary stay in their suites, and getting special rates for rooms for your family and helpers. But with the rising prices of hotel wedding banquets, these little extras just don\u2019t seem as worthwhile anymore.\nConsider having your wedding banquet at an alternative location. Country clubs like Orchid Country Club and Serangoon Gardens Country Club offer table rates of at least $798 and $788 respectively. Orchid Country Club\u2019s package even includes a one night stay in their Bridal Suite, so there\u2019s no reason not to choose it over a hotel.\nPaying for a wedding banquet is no small sum of money, so you might as well get something out of it. Citibank credit cards and UOB credit cards usually have exclusive wedding promotions with certain hotels and restaurants. Alternatively, you can just choose a good air miles credit card to charge your wedding banquet to, and use the miles you\u2019ve earned to pay for your honeymoon.\nThis one seems like an obvious suggestion, since for several hotels, banquets on Saturday have their prices marked up by at least $100 per table. That\u2019s savings of at least $3000 to $4000 alone by not having it on Saturday. But price really isn\u2019t the only reason you should be considering having your banquet on another day. Think of how physically stressful a traditional wedding day can be.\nFor many couples, the day begins ridiculously early with the bride getting made up and into her gown. The men aren\u2019t entirely spared either, with the groom and his entourage going through the horrors of gate crashing and bridal games (and the delays they often cause). Then there\u2019s the wedding ceremony itself, which can take up to two hours.\nDepending on how dramatic a wedding banquet gets, the married couple may not even get to eat! Before the dinner is over, the bride needs to at least have had a couple of outfit changes, and also gone from table to table taking photographs. So by the time the banquet ends late at night, the happily married couple are often happy to retire to bed, and I don\u2019t mean for baby-making purposes.\nBy holding your wedding banquet on another day, like Sunday, you not only have more time to celebrate, but you also give yourself and your partner enough breathing room to enjoy your wedding weekend.\nI don\u2019t care how popular you are on Facebook. There\u2019s no need to invite your entire friend list and their cat to your wedding. If your in-laws are being difficult and want to book like, 10 tables, for their long lost relations and old friends from their kampung days, then now you have the perfect excuse to reject them \u2013 the hotel ballroom just isn\u2019t big enough.\nThe best part is, choosing a smaller hotel ballroom might actually save you a substantial amount of money. Smaller 4 Star hotels offer a table rate that\u2019s almost half the price compared to other 4 Star hotels. For example, for a Saturday banquet, the Grand Mercure along East Coast Road is about $888 per table, and Hotel Royal along Queen Street is even less at $598 per table!\nA banquet at Amara for 40 tables would cost at least $43520. A banquet at the Grand Mercure for 35 tables would cost about $31080. Just cutting 50 people off from your guest list could save you over $10000. That\u2019s definitely a lot of money that you can add to your honeymoon fund.\nPlus, you don\u2019t have to invite that weird uncle with the Chihuahua from hell.\nYou can go to SingaporeBrides.com for the full list of wedding table prices. Also, do note that these prices may not include service charge or 7% GST.\nWhat other tips and tricks do you have for couples planning their wedding banquets? Share them with us.",

But there\u2019s a whole lot of good your hygienist does that you might not realize. Here are 5 reasons you should thank your favorite hygienists!\nThey\u2019re a familiar face. Often when you find a hygienist you click with, you tend to stay with them for years! And while you may only see your hygienist twice a year, they get to know you and your family. Some even treat the same family for generations as your family grows and changes, like recently retired Linda Bryant, who served Dental Depot patients for 31 years!\nThey\u2019re your first line of defense. Your hygienist can be counted on to help you with preventative care like cleanings and fluoride treatments, but they\u2019re also often the first to spot signs of trouble like places in your mouth that might be hard to reach or hiding pesky cavities. In fact, it was a visit to a good hygienist that got Melissa Stevens interested in dental hygiene.\nThey are some of the nicest people we know. While we pride ourselves on compassionate care, hygienists take it to a new level. Taking care of your smile is just one part of what they do and for hygienists like Linda Frazier, giving you something to smile about is something she looks forward to every day.\nThey\u2019re constantly learning. Hygiene school is highly competitive but even after a hygienist has graduated, they\u2019re still learning. More than half of hygienists complete 20+ hours of continuing education each year to improve their skills as dentistry evolves. Take it from Tracey Domingue, there are always new goals to set.\nThey give back to their communities. Did you know that 70% of hygienists participate in 1-5 community service events each year? We\u2019re grateful to our hygienists for volunteering their time to participate in events like Dentistry from the Heart. And they even go out of their way to find other ways to give back, like Delano Debro and the ministry he does in prisons.\nDo you have a hygienist you love? Tell us all about them on Twitter @DentalDepotOKC or @DentalDepotTuls and use #NDHW19.\nNext:Battle of the Brushes: Which Toothbrush is Best?",

Great for potlucks and the holidays.\nI think Red Velvet Cake is a requirement for the holiday season. This Red Velvet Poke Cake is definitely required for any holiday celebration this season! OMG! This cake is out of this world delicious!\nPoke Cakes are one of my favorite desserts because I can make them a few days ahead of time and they get better the longer they sit in the fridge. Letting it sit in the fridge overnight gives the cake time to soak up all that yummy chocolate and sweetened condensed milk. It is hard to wait overnight to eat the cake, but it really is better if you can muster up the will power to wait.\nThe star of this recipe might be the quick homemade Cream Cheese Frosting! OMG! It really puts this poke cake over the top!! This Red Velvet Poke Cake is going to be a staple at all of our holiday parties. It is great for potlucks or even a homemade gift. Bake the cake in a foil pan and pop a bow on top.\nWhile cake is baking, mix milk and chocolate fudge topping until well blended. When the cake is done and while it's still hot, poke holes in it with a fork or straw. Pour milk mixture over the cake. Allow cake to cool completely.\nSpread cream cheese frosting over the top. Chill.\nI made this cake today to take to a friend who had a death in her family. It was so delicious that I am making it for a party for tomorrow night. Very rich and the icing is soooooooooooo good!\nSO glad it was a success!!! That icing is amazing! I could just eat it straight off a spoon.\nSo true confession...I also ate the icing straight off the spoon!!!!!!!!!\nI have now made this cake 3 times since you posted the recipe! Thanks for another keeper!\nThat is awesome!! SO glad you are enjoying it!!\nThank you Stephanie for your quick reply. Looking forward to making and eating !!\nI made the cake following your recipe and it is wonderful! One more question please. Do you thank this would work in a Bundt pan.

Set in the ancient Ghanaian empire in the time of the Mali Kingdom under Mansa Musa\u2019s rule, I Sing of a Well tells a story of life before the arrival of Europeans and the emergence of the West African slave trade. The plotline focuses on issues of love, passion, and abuse of power. Prince Wenambe wins the throne from his father after he pledges allegiance to Mansa Musa for protection against slave raiders. In order to take on this position, Wenambe requires a wife. He desires Soraya, who is already betrothed to Dume, a hunter. Stemming from his jealousy, Wenambe has Dume killed and forces Soraya to become his queen although she is pregnant with Dume\u2019s son. Prince Wenambe falls into depression as Soraya\u2019s apathy toward him remains unwavering and his plan to protect his village backfires when Mansa Musa begins to enslave his people.\nPan African Film Festival: 2011 Filmmakers Awards.

    "text": "We spoke previously on the management of privileged accounts and how important it is to keep them accountable. Privileged accounts are one of many different types of accounts that should fall under your organizations Account Management Program and another one to add to that would be service accounts.\nWhat is a service account anyway? In basic terms, a service account is an account that a service on your computer uses to run under and access resources. This should not be a user\u2019s personal account. While they may look the same, the separation of users from services is very important for both tracking and the ability to tighten down what an account can and cannot do. A service account could also be an account that is used for a scheduled task (sometimes referred to as a batch job account), or an account that is used in a script that is run outside of a specific user\u2019s context. A scheduled task account should not be a personal user\u2019s account for the same reasons that a service should not run under a personal user\u2019s account.\nYou may ask what is so important about these? It seems like if it is not a user account, then how would it have access to my organization\u2019s network? On the contrary, these accounts are a favorite target of many malicious actors because they are often implemented in such a way that they have a higher level of access than a user account. Historically, they also have not changed passwords as often (if ever) as user accounts.\nServices are often installed under the built-in Local System account, which gives what are essentially local administrator privileges, so they are more predictable in how they will be able to be used if compromised. While local administrator privileges may seem somewhat harmless since they are not usually useable on other computers on your network, the local administrator privileges can end up granting access to domain username/password combinations and or lead to account changes that allow for easier connections to other parts of your network. As a result, both locking down a service account and following good password change and audit procedures is an important part of keeping your systems secure.\nWhen it comes to the configuration and management of service accounts, there a few things listed below that can help.\nPassword Management \u2013 Some administrators like to set these accounts up with passwords that do not expire or use the same password for all the service accounts. Instead, there needs to be a strategy for managing these passwords and changing them on a regular basis, as well as using unique passwords.\nPrivilege Management \u2013 It is best practice to implement the principle of least privilege. Only provide the minimum necessary privileges to service accounts. If your service account must run with administrative privileges, deny that account access to all of the directories besides the one or two that it needs.\nNaming \u2013 Consider names that are not completely obvious to the service, for example SQLService would be helpful to administrators, but it is more helpful to attackers. While obfuscation is not usually a recommendation to secure systems, in this case it may slow someone down enough to not want to try every account available.\nAuditing \u2013 Logging and auditing of service accounts, and all accounts in any case, is very important to keep systems secure. Using an event log aggregator and looking for specific events can be helpful in discovering security problems and services that are not working correctly.\nLocking down your service accounts should be a basic component of your hardening guide for all computers. While it requires more time to lock down a new service account to allow access only to what it needs, it is well worth the time spent. Defense-in-depth requires that you look at more than the perimeter, and service accounts are one major place where the in-depth strategy can serve you well.",

Just that his convoluted shout-out wasn't the first or only way his request was communicated to EC. He actually said something like, \"It's Sunday, Elvis, so welcome us to the working week.\" I didn't really understand what he'd said until EC started playing the song. I can't believe EC would have been able to parse it, cold, from 20 feet away, over the rest of the crowd noise. But he went right into the song without so much as a \"Huh?\"\nInteresting. You were definitely closer to the source than me.\nLisa's face lit up just now when I played this, with goose bumps ensuing. Good times.\nParaphrasing W.C. Fields in A Fatal Glass of Beer, last Wednesday night (March 7) in Brooklyn and much of the nor\u2019easter-wracked Eastern seaboard wasn\u2019t a fit night out for man or beast. But Elvis Costello & The Imposters rose to the occasion for the many hearty souls who still braved the elements for the first of four New York area shows (Port Chester\u2019s Capitol Theatre hosted the next three, last Thursday, Friday and Sunday nights).\nTaking the stage to the perfect choice of Rosemary Clooney\u2019s \u201cSnow,\u201d Elvis & Co.. were on fire from the get-go, rattling off an initial volley of front-loaded favorites (\u201cWonder Woman,\u201d \u201cGirls Talk,\u201d \u201cBig Tears,\u201d \u201cMiracle Man,\u201d Radio Radio\u201d and \u201cThis is Hell\u201d) with such blazing abandon that drummer Pete Thomas seemed on the verge of spontaneously combusting at any moment.\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the band that was scorching. For his last few tours Costello has brought along two terrific backup vocalists in Briana Lee and Kitten Kuroi, and in these shows he\u2019s really integrated them into the set masterfully, particularly the second half, following the band\u2019s departure after \u201cI Want You.\u201d The gals stayed on and stepped over with Costello to a single microphone set up at the front of the stage, crowding him from both sides as they all sang \u201cAlison\u201d to his acoustic guitar accompaniment, the inspired trio turning into a three-way love fest by song\u2019s end.\nFrom there they followed Costello to keyboardist Steve \u201cThe Professor\u201d Nieve\u2019s vacant grand piano, maestro himself tickling the ivories as he sang \u201cA Face in the Crowd,\u201d Lee and Kuroi backing him on the title song of his hoped-for Broadway musical based on Elia Kazan\u2019s 1957 film classic starring Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal.\nRather than coming off corny, it was truly affecting, so much so that a good many in the crowd responded in kind. And to top it all off, Costello announced that despite the declining consumer interest in the album format, he and The Imposters have in fact completed a new one for release later this year.\nThat reminds me of the Brodsky Quartet show at Town Hall in New York back in 93. Elvis announced the last number and my buddy yelled out \"Jacksons Monk and Rowe\" really loudly and they played the song again. So much fun.",

    "text": "What actions might be needed to jump start the tourism industry in Pohnpei?\nI believe much has been said about this topic in the past. However, I'd like to bring it up again; so that we can have a new and fresh look at it again. I hope those who are in the know about this subject matter--would contribute to this discussion.\nFirst, tour operators used to say that Pohnpei airport was too short for charter flights. Well, the airport was extended several years ago with financial assistance and technical assistance from Japan.\nSecond, others use to complain that there is not enough room. Well, there is a new couple of storey hotel building in town. We probably have over 300 rooms available--more or less--Cliff, Ocean View, the new Hotel, Joy and others.\n1. If there is already a serious and comprehensive report on how to start the tourism industry in Pohnpei, I am asking anybody to let us know; so that we can read it and update it; or take some actions accordingly.\n2. I am assuming that a complete and good report does not exist. As such, let me offer some ideas: a) a tourism market analyst should look at the resources that Pohnpei has to offer; and b) determine whether they could attract certain type of tourists from China or Korea or Japan or America or Europe or where.\n3. The question is whether at least one charter flight could be arranged from either Japan, Korea or China per week? If we start with that assumption, what are the necessary actions to take in order to accomodate the planes requirements; and to accomodate the tourists; and make them occupied or happy or contented for at least 3 days; before they return home.\nThese are my initial comments and suggestions for now. Is it possible or not to have a modest number of tourists to come to Pohnpei consistently--every week--for a whole year at a time? If possible, then, we should go for it. Any other observations and suggestions would be appreciated.\nThe public could give the Pohnpei Visitors\u2019 Bureau a big pay raise and a bigger round of applause. If not, then try the opposite or something else, but don\u2019t do nothing and expect something. For example, the US national debt was doubled; the jobs were going over-seas; so the Americans tried a different approach to the problem. They elected a billionaire CEO instead of the customary career politician. Like the idiom goes, \u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\u201d So they tried someone very different from your ordinary politician. Of course, the world is still full of insane people, who demand the usual approach to a growing problem. But that's another topic.\nAnyway, that is my two cents and I hope you would appreciate it, like you said that you would. There is much left unsaid about the complex issue of tourism. Other Micronesians should contribute in this discussion, rather than in those they detest.\nSo I heard that for Guam tourism, the Korean tourists are known to prefer smaller hotels, not the fancy big ones. And they also don't spend as much. On the other hand, the Japanese tourism prefer to stay in the large hotels; and do spend a lot per visitor. Whether this distinction is related to the tourist promoters who are linked the particular hotels, it'll be good to know. It's not good to make such generalizations. I don't know what can be said of the Chinese tourists or US tourists or Russian tourist.\nI think if we really want to try to develop Pohnpei tourism, we need, first of all, to understand such preferences of the different groups as tourism targets; and at the same time, we need to know if Pohnpei can provide what the particular group would find as contributing to their positive tourism experience. So this is the basic principle of business an marketing analysis; and is needed before we can begin to design the tourism program and promotion.\nSo that is my first recommendation. Just some thoughts on this nice and noisy New Year's day--Jan. 1, 2019.\nFirst and foremost Tourism critically require CLEANLINESS! Our Environment must be presentably clean without artificial rubbish. Our Air, Ocean, Rivers, streams, shores and riversides must be clean. Appropriate infrastructure must also be in place. Build it and they will come. We must invest heavily into advertisements locally and globally. Preserve our Customs and Traditions. Not what is happening today where the Tourist would come and see the traditional Leaders sitting infront in Western clothing. For Pohnpei this is what it needs for Tourism to move forward.\nDid you say that we need clean up our environment and rake our yards? Well, I'll be damned! Trump was right all along!\nSo I am looking for a tourism study that shows and analyzes the \"segmentation\" of the potential tourism targets. Tourism, like any product lines--such as soft drink, beer, food products--could be more understood if a \"marketing study\" shows the segmentation of the potential market including desirable and undesirable behaviors; spending patterns; tolerance for long flights; desire for shopping vs. visiting cultural sites; duration of vacation days per different groups; what would constitute a happy tourist; etc., etc.\nNeedless to say, once you understand your potential customers--it'll be easier to improve the sites where the tourists would visits; etc., etc.,. So the question is this: does Pohnpei have the basic assets that could be developed or improved--so that the different segments of the tourism population could be attracted to visit?\nTourism matters. Don\u2019t count the US out. We have A LOT of eco-tourists who snorkel and dive. Does FSM have the logistical capability of handling 300 avid snorkelers and divers at a time? Protect the mangroves and reefs; without them you will be left with a deserted ocean.\nIs it possible to Charter a non-stop flight out of Los Angeles? If so then running ads in the diving and adventure magazines might allow you to fill those planes. Sundays out of LA and back on Saturdays would allow connections to be made to any destination in the US; with the folks leaving their offices on a Friday and returning to work on a Monday. Perhaps use the planes for domestic flights during the week. Does Yap and Chuck have airports large enough to handle those kinds of aircraft?\nBeyond tourism: FSM has one of the largest exclusive economic zones on the planet.\nI can imagine as a small country your fish and ocean resources are being exploited with very little return to FSM itself. The fishing boats should be flagged in FSM. The workers on the boats should be Micronesian, the processing plants should be Micronesian; and those ocean resources should be closely monitored and aggressively protected. I know how this world works; I am confident you are receiving a few pennies on the dollar of economic return.\nWhat percentage of capital outflow is represented in diesel fuel imports for energy production? Given topography and climate that is about as big a waste as I can imagine. Given your cost of energy; tidal, solar, and wind could be gold plated and still be more profitable than diesel generation. But more imporantly it would stem the hemorage of capital those imports represent.\nCapitalize your own banks and businesses. That single action would probably be the second most effective way in stemming capital outflow and encouraging capital formation.\nInvest locally and use reinvestment to grow; it is the only way you will be free; and that matters.\nSo, yes, US divers is just one segment of the possible many segments of the tourism market. I am assuming this segment, if you look at it closely, will have its own characteristics and behavior and spending patterns that would be very different from other segments such as tourists from China or Korea or Japan, etc.\nThe question is what kinds of assets or attractions does Pohnpei have--or that can be developed--to cater to this segment of the tourism industry.\nFirst, is the cost: there are closer destinations such as Belize, the Carribean islands, etc. which will cost less, in terms of airline costs, to visit compared to the price of the tickets to Pohnpei and back.\nSecond, what about the attractions for tourists: will the US-based divers be willing to bypass Hawaii and its other islands--to come to Pohnpei. Do we have such hot diving spots in Pohnpei to compete with other diver destinations? I think it's limited.\nThese and more are some of the items in the list to be evaluated if were we to try to focus on this segment of the market. It is doable but we need to make a good case as to why the US-based divers would be attracted to come to Pohnpei and not other less expensive and accessible destinations that have more to offer.\nI don't want to sound negative. American divers have a lot of money to spend compared to other segments of the tourism population so it should be seriously considered. It'll be good to hear from marketing experts regarding this segment and as to whether or not, it should be the focus of the Pohnpei tourism promotion drive. Just some ideas.\nHas anybody considered cruise-lines. I hate traveling in airplanes for long durations.\nA service based economy would certainly not be a first choice.\nThe South Pacific has multiple times the number of fauna and flora species than the Caribbean Basin.\nI thought Pohnpei had healthy coral reefs and good water clarity. That is the only attraction needed to attract divers and snorkelers from around the world. Has the entire planet been trawled with bottom nets? I was hoping a few spots were missed. Flora and Fauna is what the world wants to experience; it is that simple. Unfortunately the density of both flora and fauna in our oceans is rapidly decreasing.\nIf there are healthy coral reefs with large numbers of fish then imagine a market where the product is exposure to the most species of flora and fauna on the planet. It sounds foolish to use scarce capital to hire marketing experts for such a rare market. That is like saying you don\u2019t know what you have in your hands.\nPohnpei will never be able to compete with the highly sophisticated and highly profitable casinos in places like Las Vegas, Macau, Hong Kong, Monaco, London, etc.\nA tourist attraction unique to Pohnpei is Nan Madol, a United Nations World Heritage site. But until it is restored and maintained, made more accessible to visitors of all ages, and supported with world class tour guides, lodging, and restaurants, not many people will spend thousands of dollars to visit the place.\nSo if casino is out, what is it that might attract Chinese or other gamblers to Pohnpei? I don't see any.\nCruise liners is one possible ways to bring tourists in. But I don't think somebody will deliberately get on a cruise-liner with Pohnpei destination solely in mind. What we can do is for our tourism promoters to contact the cruiseliner operators that pass thru our waters--so they can make a scheduled stop on Pohnpei port for a couple of days. I heard that some of these cruise-lines go to Guam or Saipan and other destinations in our neighborhood. So it might be possible to find ways to get them to stop, more often, or on a regular basis at Pohnpei port.\nWhat about Korean visitors or Japanese visitors? We do have some Japanese visitors that come thru on a more regular basis. There are Japanese-speaking local tour operators who are equipped to hold Japanese tourists--if or when they come.\nBut I am beginning to think that we need to approach the development of the Pohnpei tourism in a slightly different way. I don't think our own government agencies and employees--who are tasked to promote and attract tourists--can do the job. It's not that they are not qualified. It's just the way the mass tourism market work.\nIf we want to bring in, say, 200 to 300 tourists to Pohnpei on a charter flight, I think we need to have the involvement of tour packagers or tour promoters--located where the possible tourists are.\nThe promoters will be the ones to advertise the tour packages; arrange for flights when there are about 200 to 300 interested tourists. They can facilitate and make bookings with the local Pohnpei hotel from their offices in Japan or S. Korea; and even plan out, example, a 3-day package. The tour operators are the ones who know the needs and desires of different tourists group. So they will be the ones who we can depend on the make the arrangements.\nIt may mean that our governments will need to find partners who are tour operators; and pay them certain amount plus commission in order for them to sell Pohnpei as destination.\nI think tourists visiting out-o- the-way places like Pohnpei would like to be dealing with reliable and trustworthy tour operators--for their safety and for assurance about the value of their vacations.\nSo I don't know what assets or attractions(?) are there in Pohnpei to attract a certain group. We still need to conduct tourist marketing studies, the segmentation of the market. In the end, we want some sort of tourist profiles as per different countries as segmented by age group, family group, environmental study group, historical study group, divers group, etc., etc.\nIn short, I think we need to develop working relationship and compensation package agreement with tourist promoters. We need to bring some of them to Pohnpei to look at our assets; and advice us on how to improve Pohnpei; so that future tourists will be satisfied once they get here. Just some thoughts.\nBesides the Nan Madol World Heritage site, FSM has spectacular sport fishing and scuba diving to attract tourists.\nWWII artifacts and shipwrecks can also attract both Japanese and American families with WWII historical connections.\nAnd yes, we need experienced tourism industry professionals to propose marketing strategies for possible implementation....IF the people and the government are really serious about tourism, that is.\nSo far, I haven't seem much evidence of serious interest, sad to say.\nFM, I agree that FSM has many attractions that could draw tourists to visit. But for business strategy, I think the government officials who are responsible for tourism policies should really work with professionals--so that the different FSM states' attractions will be identified and amplified--for the purpose of differentiating each one as a unique destination in itself. I say this because when we say FSM, it means a large region; so it'll be difficult for tourist to be able to visit all the destinations in the FSM.\nSo, let's say that a typical tourist--from Japan, S. Korea, US, Europe, Russia, etc.,--has only 3 days for vacation. How do we attract those kinds of visitors to a particular destination. I would say that we should assume that these tourists with only 3-day vacation time will only be going to one destination--whether it's Pohnpei or Chuuk or Yap or Kosrae--in the case of the FSM. Of course, other competing destinations for the 3-day vacationers are Hawaii, Guam, Palau, Saipan, RMI and other nearby locations.\nSo for the FSM, we need to define the potential destinations within the FSM. We can say that Pohnpei is unique because of its Nan Madol ruins plus its diving spots. Chuuk is unique because of the World War II wrecks. Yap is unique because of its traditional money and its sting ray alley. Also, Kosrae has its own ruins and special forests, etc.\nIn short, we need to understand, on one hand, the tourists profiles and segmentation; so we can target the different segments--in order to lure them to the spectacular and unique attractions within each of the FSM states. On the other hand, we need to define our destinations in a way that they will attract the different segments of the tourism population. Just some thoughts but I am sure these are already well understood by government officials responsible for tourism development and promotion. Hope so.\nOf the three Freely Associated States, only Palau has a thriving tourist industry.\nBoth the FSM and the RMI would be wise to learn from the ROP how to effectively attract tourists.\nIn the meantime, fisheries remain our only significant income-producing industry....and that income will continue to fluctuate annually due to tuna migration and global warming.\nI learn much on tourism from your comments, but I sometimes feel you are leap frogging. I think Factsmatter pointed out a problem which is the lack of \"serious interest.\" Shouldn't we address this problem first? Does anyone know why Micronesians, excluding Belauans and Chamorros, lack the motivation to develop their tourism industry? For example, lack of physical fitness, low energy, or maybe poor diet is to blame. Too much substance abuse maybe? Too content with no dreams or visions for greatness? Too lazy? Don't want to change lifestyle or develop self? Land's too sacred to be developed or discussed? Bored of same old leadership? Not enough public lands like in Koror and the Marianas?\nAre Micronesians really free men and women? If so, then why are we not \"seriously interested\" in building up our tourism, economy and country? Maybe we just don't like tourists and want to be left alone, like most conquered peoples living in injun reservations. Or maybe we dread the ecological, cultural, and economical impacts of tourism. Anyway, I think we should also consider the public's opinions, especially the local communities' and land owners,' when planning these ventures. Because everyone will be impacted.\nz, yes, you are making a lot of good points. I am hoping that by engaging in serious discussions about Pohnpei tourism, we can come to some conclusions; and some answers to questions which you have raised. I don't want to believe that Pohnpeians are lazy or don't want development thru tourism. But I also don't have an answer as to how to develop tourism in Pohnpei--to a level similar to Palau or Guam, etc.\nMaybe some of the reasons that you say are correct. But I am not sold yet on the idea that we are the cause of our own problem--our attitude, our way of life, low energy, etc.\nIn the end, it might prove that tourism--in the volume comparable to Palau or Guam--simply cannot occur in Pohnpei for the following reasons which have been mentioned by different people--some in this Forum, etc.\nPohnpei does not have the beaches that attract family-type tourists. Pohnpei is too far out of the way; so it'll take many vacation hours spent on the plane; so it does not attract people with only 3-day vacation. Pohnpei does not have large shopping centers such as those in Guam (Walmart, Duty-Free, etc). While Nan Madol is one of the best place in the world to visit, it would only take probably a couple of hours to make a tour to Nan Madol; and what do you do after that.\nAnother problem that I see is restrictions for hiring quality service people, such as workers from the Philippines, to come work in Pohnpei. It is difficult to recruit these workers because they also have to get US visa just to transit thru Guam a couple of hours in order to go to Pohnpei.\nIn contrast, Palau has good beaches although you have take boats to the nice rock island beaches. But some of the hotels in Koror have built artificial beaches by the hotels to cater to their tourism customers. The population of Palau is small; so the number of Palauans working for tourism is small. Most of the service workers such as waitress at restaurants, cooks, etc, are from the Philippines. And it's easy for Palau to bring in workers from PI because they don't have to go thru Guam--so they don't need to apply for visa which is costly as well as time consuming. Most importantly, Palau has been able to maintain its clean environment which is appreciated by the tourists.\nSo should Pohnpei give up on tourism because it does have the same assets and attractions as Palau or Guam? At some point in time, the leadership has to decide. I would say that we still need experts on tourism development and marketing and promotion to visit Pohnpei under contract with the Pohnpei State or with the FSM. They still need to do assessments of our assets and attraction sites. They need to help us figure as to whether or not our assets and attractions can be good enough to attract a certain segment of the tourism population.\nWe don't have to have mass tourism although the airport has been extended to accommodate charter flights. We might be able to focus on smaller number of visitors; and then, build from there. We'll see.\nDoes anyone know why Air Niugini and Air Nauru do not want to land in Guam? Only Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, South Korean, and Philippines airlines like to land in Guam. Why is this? Anyone know why Air Niugini and Air Nauru hate Guam so much?\nDisregard everything that you are talking about with regards to tourism in the FSM. Let us explore this question instead. Why does the US Government allow Japanese, Chinese, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Philippine airlines to land in Guam but not Air Niugini and Air Nauru? Is it because the pilots have curly hair? Why is this?\nI think any airline that wants to fly to any country must be able to meet that country's standard. In order to fly to Guam or Honolulu, the aircraft must meet US safety standard; pilots must meet training and retraining requirements. The airline must also have an office and crew at the airport; to service the plane and customers. It probably can contract other airlines to provide these services at the beginning.\nIt also probably need to lease or own those ramp walkway that are moved to connect to the plane once in place; for customers to work thru to the airport--unless you have a small aircraft which only requires customer to exit the plane; and walk on the airport open air to the building. The 2 airlines that you are talking about probably don't have the volume of customers to Guam--to be able to invest on the required infrastructure. It probably does not have enough revenue to meet insurance requirements.\nLastly, I am sure the business competition from United or other more established US carrier will always be a factor. I heard that United--like the Continental before it-- keeps reducing its ticket prices whenever Air Nauru tried to have flights to Guam or other destinations in Micronesia-in order to undercut Air Nauru's attempt to get a foothold of the Guam market.\nSo I am sure it has nothing to do with \"curly hair\" but more on stiff competition; as there are other \"curly hair\" pilots in United and other carriers that come to Guam.\nAir Niugini has been trying to get landing rights into Guam since 1970s. However, for some strange reason, the US Government never grants them landing rights, despite the fact that it grants landing rights to Asian country airlines from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Philippines.\nWhat would be the reason for not granting landing rights to Air Niugini? Please tell us because I think you already know this.\nWe just need to justify why should a tourist fly over Guam and Hawaii to come to FSM. Once we can get that traveler to FSM, we will have tourist.\nGood question. I think some smart person--with practical experience in tourism program planning and strategizing--might be able to provide some answers. Or, it'll be a combination of experts in business development and marketing strategies; or some people from Japan or S. Korea who actually have real life experience with packaging tours from their countries to Pacific islands nations such as Guam, Hawaii, CNMI. People with such expertise could be paid as consultant--to put some of their recommendations together to answer the question above.",

    "text": "Jesus taught how we can be one of his relations, or part of his family. It is a two-step process. First we must hear God\u2019s word. Second, we must put it into practice. His brother James was listening. James later wrote, \u201cBut prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers, who delude themselves\u201d (James 1: 22). He said we are supposed to \u201creceive the word implanted\u201d (v. 21).\nFirst we must each ask ourselves, \u201cDo we want to be close with Jesus, even as close as a brother?\u201d Secondly, \u201cWhat are we willing to do in order to achieve that personal closeness with him?\u201d Frankly, not everyone is willing to enter into a personal relationship with Jesus. That\u2019s okay, it is a personal choice but for those who do crave intimacy with the Lord Jesus he has shown the way.\nJesus put an emphasis on God\u2019s word. He told us we must put ourselves in a position to hear God\u2019s word. Bear in mind they didn\u2019t have the written word in abundance like we do today. We can \u201chear\u201d the word in many ways. One of those ways, I would suggest, is in reading it for ourselves. Furthermore, there is an incredible amount of free teaching available on television, radio and the internet. Many ministers even allow people to download this content to their own device. I find that remarkable. What other profession gives away their work product for free? We can hear great messages every single day.\nBrother James teaches us that we are to receive this word implanted. When you hear the word, you must then receive it. Just hearing someone speak the Word of the God won\u2019t do a thing for you if you don\u2019t receive it. I believe James is telling us to plant the Word of God in our hearts. This principle is well taught by Jesus in Luke 8: 15 where the sower sows the word to our hearts. There are quite a few scriptures that speak about the relationship between God\u2019s Word and our hearts. Look at Deuteronomy 6:6 for example, \u201cThese words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart.\u201d This is our starting place then. We can\u2019t do God\u2019s Word if we do not first hear it and in that hearing receive it into our hearts. This is not a brain game. It is a matter of the heart. What, then, is the condition of your heart? Is it the good soil that Jesus speaks about in Luke 8 or is it hard like the stony ground?\nFellowship with Jesus begins with God\u2019s Word. Perhaps hearing that thrills you. I hope so. Maybe, though, you are one of those who does not want to give time and place to the Word of God. I am very sorry because there is no getting around this one. No amount of intellectualization, even, is going to provide an argument that supports that position. We must all come to a place in our lives where we are willing to let Jesus be the absolute Lord of our lives and do, therefore, what he says. Either he is Lord of our lives or he is not but if he is then we should follow his instructions and his teachings. He came to give us abundant life. That is all he is trying to do with his instruction. He is trying to bless us but in order for us to receive the greatest of gifts we are going to have to taste humility.\nAs you turn your face to Jesus, soften your heart and receive his word implanted therein. Then we can talk about putting it into practice. Then we probably won\u2019t have to.",

    "text": "This article provides trademark practitioners and legal professionals with a simple guide to Italian trademark law, procedures and enforcement strategies.\n\u2022 Unregistered marks do not benefit from the presumption of validity; the burden of proof in civil proceedings is therefore higher than in the case of registered trademarks.\n\u2022 Unregistered marks cannot form the basis of an opposition and can be enforced against subsequent registration only by means of civil action.\n\u2022 The prior use of a sign which results in the sign becoming only locally well known does not exclude the novelty of a subsequent trademark.\n\u2022 Locally well-known unregistered trademarks may still be used locally, regardless of the subsequent registration by a third party of an identical or similar trademark for identical or similar goods and services. However, this prior use does not affect the novelty and validity of the subsequent third-party registration. Further, according to Article 6bis of the Paris Convention, foreign registrations that are well known in Italy may enjoy protection as unregistered trademarks.\nTo establish unregistered trademark rights, use of a sign must be effective and continuous. Such use may affect the validity of a subsequent registration only if it leads the previously used mark to become more than merely locally well known.\nAccording to Article 19 of the Industrial Property Code, any natural or legal entity that \u201cuses or intends to use\u201d a mark can apply for its registration in Italy, as long as the application is not made in bad faith. Marks can be used by either the applicant or an authorised third party, and use is considered genuine if it is true, continuous and effective. A representative of the rights holder requires power of attorney before filing; however, this power of attorney need not be notarised or legalised.\n\u2022 deceptive signs \u2013 in particular, signs which mislead the public as to the geographical origin, nature or qualities of the relevant goods and services.\n\u2022 signs which are applied for in bad faith.\nTrademark applications must be filed with the IPTO. The first e-filing system was implemented in 2006 and a completely revised e-filing system was introduced in Spring 2015. The new e-filing system is yet to be fully implemented (eg, applications for international trademark registration still require paper filing), but the IPTO is working diligently to complete the process within the shortest timeframe possible.\nOnce the application is filed, the IPTO will perform an examination based on formal requirements and absolute grounds for refusal. If the application does not meet formal requirements or must be refused on absolute grounds, the IPTO will issue a formal notification to the applicant, which is granted a period of at least two months to complete or revise the application or file observations in response to the refusal. The IPTO will then examine the applicant\u2019s response and decide whether to accept the application or reject it, either totally or partially.\nIf the application meets the requirements, it will then be published for opposition or observation by third parties.\nThe IPTO is not entitled by law to carry out any kind of search of prior rights; therefore, no official searches are available. An official online database is available at www.uibm.gov.it, but the search tools are very limited at present. However, with the implementation of the new e-filing system underway, the IPTO will soon be able to provide users with improved search tools.\ndesignations and acronyms of events and those of non-lucrative entities and associations, including the relevant emblems.\nUnregistered trademarks, company names, domain names, well-known trademarks under Article 6bis of the Paris Convention and reputation claims cannot be enforced through opposition. These can be enforced only through invalidation actions. A notice of opposition must be filed with the IPTO in writing. The notice must be written in Italian and include all required documents. An opposition fee of \u20ac250 (plus postage) must be paid before filing the notice. The notice must be submitted to the IPTO through the new e-filing system. If a representative is appointed, power of attorney is required; however, the power of attorney need not be notarised or legalised.\n\u2022 persons, entities and associations that hold relevant rights (under Article 8).\nIf the opposition is accepted, the IPTO will notify the applicant of the contested mark (the first communication). The notification will be issued within two months of the expiry of the opposition period. The parties then have a twomonth cooling-off period in which they may reach an amicable settlement, which may be extended by joint request of the parties by up to 12 months from the date of receipt of the first communication. If an agreement is reached within this period, the parties must inform the IPTO. Otherwise, the opposition enters the adversarial stage. Within two months of the expiry of the cooling-off period, the opponent may file additional supporting documents or arguments, which the IPTO will forward to the applicant, setting a term for filing its observations. Within this term, the applicant may also request the opponent to submit proof of effective use of the enforced earlier trademark, if it was registered more than five years before the date of publication of the contested application. Evidence of effective use must be filed within 60 days of the relevant notification (this term may be extended up to six months). At the end of the adversarial stage, the IPTO will decide on the opposition, either refusing the contested application (in full or in part) or rejecting the opposition and awarding costs to the winning party (which may consist of the opposition fee and up to \u20ac300 of professional fees). The losing party may appeal to the Board of Appeal within 60 days of notification of the IPTO decision. If, after making all efforts provided by the law, the IPTO cannot serve the applicant with the notice of opposition, the opposed application will be rejected ex officio.\nIn the case of an opposition against the Italian designation of an international registration, the IPTO will issue a provisional refusal, setting a three-month term for the applicant to appoint an Italian representative to defend the designation. If no representative is appointed, the provisional refusal becomes final and the designation is rejected with no further action required from the opponent.\nWhere no objections are raised by the IPTO and no third-party oppositions or observations are filed, an application can mature to registration in approximately nine to 12 months. A trademark is valid for 10 years from the filing date and can be renewed \u2013 for all or part of the originally claimed goods \u2013 for unlimited subsequent 10-year periods. There is also a grace period of six months after the official deadline, provided that the renewing party pays a surcharge. Renewal registrations are assigned new renewal application and registration numbers and a renewal certificate is issued within a couple of months of the renewal date.\nSurrender: A trademark holder can always surrender its registration. Surrender must be recorded on the register by means of an appropriate declaration (subject to fiscal registration).\nRevocation: If a trademark is not put to genuine use for five consecutive years after registration, it becomes vulnerable to revocation for nonuse, which may be filed by any interested party. If use of the mark begins or resumes after the five-year period of non-use but more than three months before the claim for revocation is filed, the registration cannot be revoked, except in the case of rights in the trademark acquired by third parties through filing or use.\nInvalidation: After registration of the mark, holders of conflicting earlier rights or any interested party (on the basis of absolute grounds for refusal) may file a claim for its invalidation. Invalidations are civil proceedings and must be filed before an IP court (tribunale delle imprese). The timeframe from filing of the claim to judgment may vary depending on the complexity of the case, but the average timeframe is two to three years.\nThe competent courts for any IP matter \u2013 involving registered or unregistered rights \u2013 are the tribunale delle imprese (enterprise tribunals): 21 highly specialised sections of the civil courts (approximately one for each Italian region). Where one party is a foreign enterprise, competence is limited to 11 of these venues, depending on the domicile or head office of the Italian counterparty of the suit.\nIn cases of either imminent or ongoing violation of an IP right, the rights holder may request the IP court to grant provisional remedies.\n\u2022 injunction (enforceable at the infringer\u2019s premises, those of subsidiaries and warehouses, and against third parties not identified in the petition).\nThe average period from filing of the petition to grant of the remedy is one month. Regarding compensation for damages, Italian judges usually take into account all appropriate factors, such as negative economic consequences \u2013 including the lost profits of the rights holder and unfair profits made by the infringer \u2013 and moral prejudice caused to the rights holder. The infringer can be forced to return all profits earned. According to Articles 473 and 474 of the Criminal Code, the infringement of a registered IP right so as to create the risk of confusion among the public is a criminal offence. Public prosecutors can therefore prosecute the felony independently if there is public deception. Consequently, even where it is advisable, it is not strictly necessary to file a criminal complaint. Article 517ter of the Criminal Code applies where the infringement does not involve an actual risk of confusion among the public. In this case, the rights holder must file a criminal complaint.\nThere are no specific requirements in Italian law to finalise an assignment, insofar as documents are concerned. However, an assignment must take written form in order to be recorded in the Trademark Register. It may be recorded by means of the original, notarised assignment deed (foreign deeds must be legalised and include a sworn Italian translation), or by means of a simplified declaration stating that the title has already been assigned. The declaration must be executed by both parties, but there is no need for notarisation or legalisation of signatures. Before recording the assignment with the IPTO, fiscal registration of the assignment deed or declaration is required. It takes approximately one year for the assignment to be recorded in the register, but the assignment is effective as of the date of filing of the petition.\nA merger is recorded by means of a petition filed with the IPTO and a certificate proving the merger, issued by the Commercial Registry or other competent authority. If the document is in a foreign language, an Italian translation must be provided. Official fees must be paid, which vary depending on the number of titles against which the merger is recorded. Although the merger is not immediately recorded in the register, it is effective as of the date of filing of the petition.\nA change of name or address is recorded by means of a petition filed with the IPTO. A power of attorney is required, but there is no need to provide additional documents. In contrast to previous practice, the current e-filing system does not allow for a petition for a change of name or address to be included in a renewal application. These changes should be recorded before proceeding with the renewal.\nTrademarks can be the object of both exclusive and non-exclusive licences, which can relate to all or some of the goods or services protected by the registration. No particular forms or formalities are required. However, according to Article 23.4 of the Industrial Property Code, the licensing of a trademark must not mislead the public as to the essential characteristics of the goods and services. Recording a licence in the Trademark Register is not compulsory, although it is advisable for the sake of public advertisement. Effective and continuous use of a trademark by a licensee is considered genuine for the purpose of use requirements.\nUnder certain circumstances, the Industrial Property Code permits cumulative and simultaneous protection of an item by trademark, design and copyright. In particular, logos may be protected as both trademarks and designs. The shapes of products and their packaging, as well as designs, may enjoy both design and 3D trademark protection, provided that they fall within the limits outlined above for shapes. Copyright protection may also be invoked for the artistic value of a logo or the item itself. Utility patent protection may also be considered in some cases.\nThe enforcement measures specified above can be applied in case of the unauthorised use of an IP right as a domain name, metatag or hyperlink. In addition to an injunction prohibiting the use of an unlawful domain name, the judicial authority may provisionally order the transfer of that domain name to the rights holder under certain circumstances (eg, payment of a bond), according to Article 133 of the Industrial Property Code. The authority that administers domain names, .IT Registry, provides a list of centres for the resolution of domain name disputes.",

    "text": "Tazara has unfavourable debt and equity ratio which closes opportunities for accessing long term operational loans from any financial institution.The company needs more than US$700 million to operate smoothly. In addition it owes the statutory authorities round $100m. These include NAPSA, ZSIC and ZRA. And as if that was not enough, it is still owing TAZARA retirees more than $20m. The list is endless as this does not include legal fees and money owed in other areas.\nTAZARA\u2019s fundamental problem is that, even if it were well capitalized and managed, the rationale for its existence largely disappeared once sanctions against Rhodesia / Zimbabwe were lifted and the border re-opened. In recent years the expansion of Beira, Nacala, Walvis and other regional ports has further reduced the need for heavy investment in TAZARA. With RSZ itself having substantial surplus capacity, it is doubtful whether there is sufficient traffic for one railway, let alone two.\nWhich brings us to the basic question - if not TAZARA, where should government prioritise investment? The answer is clear : roads! Zambia suffers from a \"landlocked trap\". We are heavily dependent on our neighbours for road and rail access to sea. However, even in terms of internal road network, Zambia has not invested significantly enough compared to other aspirational African countries. In other words, its okay that we have neighbours with poor road or rail network or insufficient port capacity, but there's no reason why cannot do our bit, to get road network in order! Its no surprise therefore that evidence appears to suggest that Zambia's lack of adequate infrastructure is acting as a constraint on the expansion of trade and economic activity. The World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, ranks Zambia's transport infrastructure below the average of other sub-Saharan African countries and low-income countries.\nMany of our local areas are isolated and in desperate need of good accessible rural infrastructure. With good roads accessibility improves in terms of delivery of services and local commerce. Without proper rural roads it becomes impossible to make serious efforts in improving market development. Good roads reduce local market failures in critical sectors such as agriculture and tourism.\nThe PF government therefore should continue to rightly prioritize investments in rural roads over rail because roads have a greater potential to directly affect the poor and enable them to become players in the market. Minister Mukanga is performing exceptionally well in delivering at pace the Link 8000, Lusaka 400 and Pave Zambia 2000 projects. Zambia is on course for total transformation of its road network thanks to the excellent priority President Sata has placed on these project. My prayer is that the Minister and the President do not get distracted with TAZARA issues.\nThe Government should press ahead and sell TAZARA - but who would buy it?",

    "text": "With an abundance of caf\u00e9s in Montreal, it\u2019s hard to decide which place is the best for over-caffeinating. To help students choose where to pretend to study, The McGill Tribune has compiled a list of the best coffeeshops that are sure to brew up good ideas for any upcoming paper or project.\nA mere two minutes away from McGill\u2019s Downtown campus, this caf\u00e9 offers a quintessential university experience that few coffee shops can truly match. Opened in 2016, it\u2019s attached to McGill\u2019s Carrefour Sherbrooke residence, so study-goers can enjoy a cup of coffee while listening to the sounds of first years stressing over their exams. The ambience of this Starbucks is unique, with an upstairs study area that mimics Birks Library without librarians constantly shushing you. However, one let down is that many menu items are frequently unavailable at this location\u2014if you have a hankering for a quiche, you will most likely have to look elsewhere.\nThis Starbucks coffee shop provides customers with a gorgeous view of avenue du Parc, the most iconic street in Montreal\u2019s Milton-Parc neighbourhood. If you don\u2019t mind competing with other McGill students for a table where half of the outlets don\u2019t even work, this is the study spot for you. However, with the generic \u201cindie coffee shop\u201d playlist blaring so loudly that you can hear it through your headphones, and food way too expensive for the frugal scholar, you\u2019ll probably only be able to study here for a maximum of 10 unproductive minutes. Make sure to visit this location as soon as possible as it\u2019s closing on March 30.\nLocated in the heart of Les Cours Mont-Royal, this Starbucks goes against the grain when it comes to environment. Situated in the underground mall, it boasts a sinusoidal pattern of pedestrian chaos and lulled tranquility every four to six minutes in accordance with the arrival of the nearby metro. It also showcases an impressive interior design by blending its seating into the surrounding food court area. Best of all, this Starbucks has the worst online rating of all the coffee shops in the list, boasting a solid two out of five stars on Yelp.\nFound in the beautiful Plateau neighbourhood, this Starbucks is one of a kind. Only a couple of blocks away from beloved Caf\u00e9 Campus, its location offers the perfect balance between class and trash. In addition, they offer many pastries that closer-to-campus locations cannot, but keep in mind that their quality does in no way compare to the many local bakeries nearby. However, it may be hard to find a spot to sit since the place tends to be packed with students trying to avoid the library.",

    "text": "That girl was way out of my league. Holy lol. I can't believe I was so naive.\nI browsed her sister's facebook profile and it's pure sui fuel. All her male friends are chads and pretty boys. She won't even add sub 7 males.\nIt would be very naive to think that her sister (girl I went out with) is any different. One time I saw her with a guy and he was a 9/10 pretty boy. I could never compete. She probably has an army of chads at her disposal just like her sister.\nBut NoFap and lifting had boosted my confidence and ego to insane levels that I thought I could get her. I completely overlooked her SMV. I was such a dumbass. There was no way that in 2018 an asocial subhuman like me could have fucked a stacy. How dellusional was I?\nSo you're just giving up without trying even though she said yes when you asked her on a date?\nDidn't you read how it went with her?\nYou just can't win if you are sub 7. I knew I was pushing my luck. How can I cope for being the ugliest guy she went out with?\nGirls have literally 1000s of beta orbiter constantly complimenting them.\nIn their mind if you orbit they think you are boring and aren't a challenge.\nLiterally the whole point of looksmaxxing is to make other females jealous when females are jealous they fight over men because it signifys high value.\nYou just gotta COLD APPROACH man!\nyou're drunk right now aren't you?\nBecause this girl is ''different'' and doesn't have beta orbiters right?\nNowadays every girl that's above 4/10 has thousands of insta followers. In order to get that many as a male you have to be model tier or heavy status which is rare.\nI can show you plenty of girls who don't even have reached 150 followers.\nSome girls are different and most normies don't go near her because she lowers status if you are seen with her.\nWhat are you OP, 14?\nWhy do baseball caps look stupid on some people?",

    "text": "There are the obvious options for wedding venues: Churches, hotels, community centers, private resorts. Some of those options are expensive and some of them aren\u2019t.\nHowever, if your wedding has a lead time longer than just a week or two, you might be overlooking a few more interesting options.\nAnd let\u2019s be clear right up front: the point of this piece isn\u2019t to save money, necessarily, but you may find that many of these options are more affordable than a 10k booking at a downtown resort simply because they haven\u2019t been commercialized in the way that traditional wedding venues have.\nImagine a pristine morning on the water.\nMaybe it\u2019s a bit brisk, but the waves are crashing gently on the shoreline. The sun is up, but the air is still cool and the breeze from the coast keeps the bugs well away from everyone and everything.\nGrowing up on the coast, I\u2019ve seen this one personally. Beach wedding venues are a great way to give everyone in your wedding party (no matter how large) a breath of fresh air and a gathering to remember.\nWhile you might need to check with the local municipality to see if there are any restrictions, beaches are, by and large, free and open to the public.\nIf you close off a space or you need to rent out a few pavilions or whatnot, you might be charged for that \u2014 but you\u2019ll likely be looking at something relatively affordable, as weddings go.\nOne of most straightforward tricks for better photography is to find a photogenic subject. Placing a wedding in a beautiful location is a great way to end up with beautiful wedding shots.\nHere in the city, everyone wants to get away. Many of my clients rent a cottage (if they don\u2019t have own one anyway) at least once or twice a year.\nWhy not have a wedding out there? As far as wedding venues go, you\u2019ll have privacy and a wide selection to choose from, especially if you\u2019re planning advance. Particularly if you have a family cottage, you\u2019d find yourself surrounded by ancestral heritage.\nCottages are usually secluded and well away from the city, so expect a drive if you go this route. However, if saying your vows in a secluded place and surrounded by loved ones feels better to you than a church or a hotel ballroom, it can be a much better way to connect with friends and family who want to be part of your special day.\nAvid hikers and morning walkers will relate to this one. There\u2019s just something about the serenity and pristine stillness of the woods that gives the area and atmosphere of quiet anticipation.\nA wedding party in the woods requires a bit of planning, but as far as wedding venues go, it\u2019s a great pick!\nOf course, a wedding at the height of fall is all about the colour change, and that\u2019s a love story that practically writes itself. Remember what I said earlier about wedding venues in photogenic places?\nCheck around your local area. Go for a drive or walk the hiking trails nearby. You typically don\u2019t have to venture very far into the woods to find an ideal spot for a quiet getaway.\nThough historic sites are often equipped for weddings, they\u2019re often forgotten in the search for ideal wedding venues.\nOld grist mills, barns, even covered bridges and log cabins are all possible contenders for an alternative venue, particularly if you prefer a rustic style.\nIf you see something you like while you\u2019re walking around the city or driving down the highway, don\u2019t be afraid to ask about it.\nThe worst answer you can get is \u201cno\u201d, and you\u2019ll have a host of other options anyway.\nThis is my personal favourite. When searching for the perfect venue, try to find something that matches the season.\nThat corn maze you visited last year or the pumpkin patch right down the road might be great fits for wedding venues with a fall or harvest flavour. Sunflower and wheat fields are wonderfully scenic during midsummer. And, of course, winter weddings are beautiful even if it\u2019s a little chilly.\nAs a photographer, I see the inside of churches quite a bit. And don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 most of them are really beautiful. The wedding business has no shortage of wedding venues when it comes to churches, hotels, and similar commercial getaways.\nAll I\u2019m saying here is that, whatever your budget, you might find your wedding even more memorable if you treat your search for the perfect location like a treasure hunt.\nFind something that aligns with your personality and style. Unique venues like the ones above also gives a photographer like me the chance to deliver a host of images with a different look and feel than your standard chapel service.\nI mentioned at the top of this piece that this article wasn\u2019t about saving money. And that\u2019s true; it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about making memories that last. The place you choose to say your vows will mean even more if the place you select is something special.\nThat\u2019s something that a lot of couples overlook.",

    "text": "A lot of extremely useful information for boaters is produced by government agencies. Since those agencies have a mandate to share that information with the public, and since free distribution via the Internet seems like an obvious way to do that, one would think that a lot of government information would be available that way.\nWell, some of it is. I previously wrote about the data available from NOAA weather buoys, and I\u2019ll probably be writing in the not-too-distant future about how cool it is that one can download current Coast Pilots and Local Notices to Mariners.\nSo you\u2019ll understand that I was really excited by this article in the current issue of BoatUS by Elaine Dickinson: Charts go PC.\nAs digital technology moves forward at an ever-increasing speed, a bewildering array of chart products are out in the consumer marketplace, with more coming. Now, in a major development, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will soon, if it hasn\u2019t done so by presstime, make its full suite of 970 raster electronic charts of U.S. waters available free to the public via the Internet.\nUp until now, boaters with navigation software had to purchase their charts from a vendor or pay a vendor for a subscription to a chart updating service. Now all of the charts, plus weekly \u201cpatches\u201d of chart updates, can be downloaded from NOAA at no cost. The site is www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.\nThe change has come about following the expiration of an exclusive agreement between NOAA and Maptech, a private company that co-developed the electronic chart format with the federal agency. Maptech\u2019s Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ended in June, freeing up NOAA to release electronic raster charts to the public since it co-owns the resulting format and files.\nThe Office of Coast Survey (OCS) does intends to distribute Raster Nautical Charts (RNCs) and updates for free over the Internet in the same manner as our distribution of Electronic Navigational Charts (see http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/MCD/enc/index.htm).\nIn addition, OCS also anticipates establishing a program by which commercial, value-added providers will be able to download RNCs for free; reformat, encrypt, and/or packaged them with additional data or services; and eventually sell the resulting product for whatever price the market will bear. By adhering to a simple set of NOAA specified practices, these RNCs will retain their official status.\nHowever, as of today (November 7, 2005) a commencement date for either program has not been established by the Office of Coast Survey.\nSo, no free raster charts for now. But soon, hopefully.\nNOAA pushed back the release of the raster charts after we went to press. It was supposed to be Mid-October. Right now, they are saying Mid-November. Please check back with them in a few weeks or watch our web site for an update.\nLater update: The charts are now available. Yay! See Downloadable Raster Charts Available Free from NOAA.",

There is already a vast divide between (a) people, often mobile professionals, who can own property in the South-East and also when their careers require it live further North, and (b) those who started in the North and can barely buy anything in the South, however much they need to get professional experience there.\nReducing incomes away from the South-East will exacerbate this divide significantly, and will have serious impacts for national and regional housing markets, with all the additional outcomes which will inevitably follow.\nThis proposal kicks any remaining shred of regional strategy way out of sight, and announces loud and clear that Tory ministers \u2013 Osborne, Lansley, Cameron and all \u2013 have absolutely no interest in achieving greater equity of well-being amongst UK citizens. Some of us may already know that, but now many more will also recognise this stark truth.\nAre the LibDems past caring?\nThe response of the Liberal Democrats to these proposals for regional pay will be interesting.\nTheir support has traditionally be greater in areas where pay will now be falling relative to the South-East; but can the LibDems sink any further in electoral terms?\nWill Nick Clegg and the rest of his party sign up to the Osborne-Lansley axis, on the basis that electorally things can\u2019t get any worse for the LibDems; or will there be resistance in the hope that \u2018fighting back\u2019 will bolster their future prospects with the voters?\nAn opportunity to arrest De-governance?\nWhatever, it\u2019s probably a vain hope that the Clegg response will be based on much more than short-term party political advantage. He has already capitulated completely to the De-governance, anti- serious social policy, agenda of his Tory minders, and the LibDem party as a whole is it seems powerless to change this.\nPerhaps though there\u2019s a small hope that others may put this further LibDem discomfort to better use. We need very urgently to arrest the disastrous trajectory of the ConDem mission by any means available, and this political fissure is grist to that mill.\nThis entry was posted in Viewpoint and tagged Andrew Lansley, ConDems, Conservative, David Cameron, DE-governance, economy, George Osborne, health, housing, Liberal Democrat, NHS, Nick Clegg, pay, regional, strategy.

This is one sign that many people miss.\nAs a human on this Earth, you are inherently powerful with a myriad of different energies, and energy meridians. As these meridians are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, they are linked to a clock-like system that energizes certain regions of the body, depending on the time of day.\nIf you're having a tough time falling asleep during this time period (which is the most common bedtime for people), it's a sign that you're still carrying the stresses and worries from your day.\nTo combat these effects, practice meditation, promotive mantras, and other relaxation practices. Yoga and stretching also work wonders.\nTraditional Chinese Medicine posits that this period of time is linked to our gall bladders. If you're waking up during these hours, it can be indicative of emotional disappointment.\nFocus on unconditional self-love, and remember to forgive yourself for any mistakes you've made.\nThis time period is connected to our liver. If you're waking during these hours, it's a good sign that you are harboring feelings of anger, and have too much yang energy.\nPoor a tall glass of cold water and reconcile with your anger; figure out what is troubling you, so you may get some rest.\nWaking during these hours is linked to our lungs, and is a sign of sadness. To return to restful nights, practice deep breathing exercises while you focus your thoughts on expressing faith in whatever your higher power may be. Know that they will help you.\nAdditionally, waking between these hours can be a sign that your higher power is trying to tell you something. When they are sending you messages, it is wise to pay attention; they are trying to bring you into better alignment with your ultimate purpose.\nDuring this time, our energy resides mostly in our guts, the large intestines. If you're waking up during these hours, you might having emotional blockages. Once you're awake, stretch out your body or use the bathroom to fall back into a slumber.\nWhen we dream, we are highly receptive of any messages being sent to us from our Higher Power. If we look closely enough, we can see that our dreams depict certain details of our journey through life. This spiritual journey is important, and thus, so are the messages being sent to us.\nOnce we realize that we are living this life in order to become the best version of ourselves that we can possibly be, we gain a higher awareness, a deeper form of consciousness, one that allows us to ascend.\nConsistently waking between 3:00am and 5:00am is a sign that your Higher Power is trying to contact you. Do your best to listen to what it has to say.",

    "text": "QPM Cosmetology belongs to the Wellness range. All of the applications contained in this range are intended for professionals in a variety of sectors. It provides them with information on the levels and consequences of oxidative stress on the individual. This oxidative stress, which is responsible for all our ills, is exactly what the bio-impedance measurement measures. If oxidation occurs somewhere in the body, then obviously this alters the passage of the electrical current.\nFor QPM Cosmetology the skin is a system in its own right, having its own laws and functions. Like all of the other systems of the body, this system is prey to oxidative stress due to the very fact of the aging process in living systems. Each human being possesses its own, specific Longevity depending both on the genetic makeup and on biochemical and metabolic factors, environment agents and also the inner self, the psychological makeup (for instance, anxious individuals age more quickly). The skin on the face is the one place in particular where the individual\u2019s inner self meets with the physical stressors due to the environment (the skin is usually not covered by clothing) and the free radicals present a more intense oxidative activity here merely by virtue of that absence of protection. The tensions and stresses of modern day living can be seen more markedly in the face than anywhere else on the body, because the face is the most exposed portion of our body as it is usually left uncovered. Local oxidative stress causes aging, deterioration of the conjunctive tissue, loss of hydration, poor oxygenation of the tissues, just so many factors that predispose the face to wear. If the skin is hydrated, oxygenated, if the pH is modified, visible and measurable effects can be objectively observed through the before and after measurements of bio-impedance. This therefore enables us to show the real, biophysical condition of the skin and its oxidation, to propose an assessment of the skin\u2019s condition, to recommend the type of product to apply, to monitor the progress of the results of application of the cosmetics.\nQPM Cosmetology performs a direct measurement of clinical stress, which is also a factor that predicts the action of the different cosmetics applied to the skin. The technology indicates which products of the range are most appropriate to the individual, and prescribes then in a way that admits of little discussion, hence a wager of efficacy.\nThis application concerns cosmetics manufacturers first and foremost, as well as all professionals called upon to give advice or apply cosmetics.",

Such overcrowding will likely have tourists turning their eyes to lesser known destinations and Bosnia and Herzegovina is a best kept secret you should discover while it\u2019s still relatively unknown.\nThe country was rocked by the Balkan conflicts of the 90\u2019s and emerged as one of the poorer players in the region, however what it may lack in international appeal, it has more than enough to entertain in authentic and local charms.\nWe made the journey to the capital city of Sarajevo to spend New Year\u2019s Eve and it was a spectacular celebration. Music filled the city squares and thrilled locals made us feel at home so that the crowd never felt overwhelming.\nSarajevo, like many of the cities still bears its scars of the conflict, buildings that are chipped and marked by arms, but the city has really risen from the ashes. It has a blossoming hostel, hotel and homestay market. Cafes and restaurants are filled with young people enthusiastic about life and culture.\nIt is possible to see churches, mosques and synagogues which demonstrate the deep roots of this ancient crossroads. The old town market holds delightful coffee, souvenirs and local foods that smell and taste savory. It really feels like a small town even though it is the capital.\nMostar is the second most visited city on the list so that\u2019s where we went next. The blue green waters of the Neretva river are iconic and they stand out even more against the famous white stone bridge which arches high above the waters. Mostar is a tiny town, but it was largely undisturbed by the war and so offers a window into past architecture and culture.\nOne of the best ways to see all of these cities is to take advantage of the country\u2019s high functioning bus system between towns or to rent a car. The dramatic views of steep mountains, deep forests and pure rivers. Small towns are everywhere and being able to catch a glimpse of local life feels like traveling backwards in time to Europe of a few centuries ago.\nA town we did not get time to see but we recommend and want to see in the future is Tuzla. It\u2019s the third largest city and it has a well preserved old town along with a young population that promises a city filled with culture and opportunities.",

The LDA provided language changes which provided patient input and transparency. The bill was brought before the Subcommittee, but an amendment in the nature of a substitute was offered and passed out instead\u2014a substitute that was dangerous for patients.\nThe LDA led a nationwide campaign to bring back patient friendly language and had a letter signed by 154 groups nationwide stating what was necessary from a patient perspective which was sent to all of the Members of the Energy & Commerce Committee. We then worked with Mr. Gibson and the Committee to change the language to produce a bill which will help provide a research agenda for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases including evaluating chronic or persistent infection and co-infections.\nThe LDA thanks Mr. Gibson, bill sponsor; Mr. C. Smith; and Mr. Upton and all of the Committee members who supported the bill. We also thank our partner groups who were instrumental in the effort to pass this legislation, and all Lyme groups across the country, patients, and other groups who worked on this effort. The next step for the bill is to go to the House floor, which will probably occur sometime after the summer Congressional recess.\nDay 2 video (7/30), bill voting, is in the second video box, begins at 33:20.",

    "text": "The Universal company manufactured some of the highest quality chronograph wristwatches that have ever come from Switzerland, yet today, even at a time when the vintage watch market seems to be rising almost by the month, they can still be acquired with a little effort and careful vetting for the very modest outlay of just a few thousand pounds.\nThe sheer value for money offered by this 1939 Unicompax model in stainless steel is unbeatable and we have often commented in our business that if the general public, or even the collecting community, ever wakes up and realises how exceptional these models really are, they will treble or quadruple in worth within the space of a few months. Compared side by side and judged with an impartial eye, these classic Universals are in every way equal to Rolex hand wound chronographs from the same period, yet tidy examples by the more famous brand change hands for five and even six figure sums. A persuasive argument could be put forward that in fact, the Universal was a better watch than its Rolex equivalent, not least because it contained an in-house \u201cmanufacture\u201d movement. Universal designed, built and finished its own movements whereas Rolex always purchased its chronograph mechanisms from third parties, most notably Valjoux.\nThis particular example is in nearly mint condition throughout and is of a standard that could be acquired for investment. We specialise in immaculate watches that have been clearly well cared for and these make up the core of our business, but even so, we were delighted to secure this piece for our stock. It was bought privately and we don\u2019t know its past, but it is immediately apparent from its remarkable state of preservation that it has seen very little use and almost certainly been a prized item that its previous owner, or owners, has brought out only on special occasions.\nThe large stainless steel case is almost unmarked, with only the very tiniest of imperfections here and there that must be expected on any watch that is not brand new. There have been no repairs to this case and it is among the best that has survived anywhere.\nInternally, the snap on case back is covered with an engine turned pattern and signed \u201cFond Acier ( the French term for stainless steel), Metal Chrome, Universal U.W ( Universal Watch), Geneve\u201d. Interestingly, the reference to metal chrome relates to the high chromium content used in the better grades of stainless steel alloy that were employed by the Swiss luxury watch industry in the 1930s and 1940s. The most common of these, used by everyone from Rolex through to Patek-Philippe, was Staybrite, but there were many others, among which this was one. Steel cases from this period have a very distinctive \u201cglow\u201d that is quite different from current steel models. Anyone looking at this piece, even without any specific knowledge, would immediately pick up on its old fashioned, vintage appearance and the strange shine of its steel case only accentuates this effect.\nExternally, the case back is stamped with the model reference 32401 and the unique serial number 749815. Unusually, Universal followed the system we normally associate with Rolex, with a serial number on its cases being used to identify age. Omega, Jaeger LeCoultre, Longines, IWC and Zenith are all dated by the numbers on their movements rather than cases. The two extremes for vintage Universal production for 1939 were 733333 and 766666, confirming that this piece was manufactured in the middle of that year. It is fascinating to speculate on who would have purchased such an expensive luxury watch at a time when Europe was facing great financial uncertainty as the storm clouds of approaching war grew ever darker. We do not know the history of this item, but we can be sure that its first owner was clearly a well heeled individual who perhaps regarded it as a safe, and portable, investment during a period when there was a great danger of currency devaluation and a more remote one of occupation.\nBoth pushers and the winding crown are original. These points are important when buying a vintage watch at this level. To be fair, most chronographs with rectangular pushers tend to have their originals still in place due to the difficulty of finding replacements that will exactly fit the holes in the case side, but it is quite another story with those models that feature screw in, round section pushers. Often swapped to enhance the appearance of a worn watch, screw in pushers seem to be changed routinely in the on-line auction world, which is a great shame as old stock originals for brands like Universal, Heuer and Breitling can be almost impossible to source. Similarly, keep an eye out for winding crown authenticity. We have seen a number of Unicompax and Tricompax models from the 1930s fitted with crowns signed with the Universal \u201cU\u201d emblem on their outer surface. This is not correct and Universal only signed crowns in this manner from the 1970s onwards. The appropriate crown for a late 1930s Unicompax is the polished unsigned unit here.\nWhen vintage watches are assessed by experienced collectors, more attention is given to their dials than to any other aspect. Dials are vulnerable to damage by bright sunlight, damp and any dust that manages to creep around the outside of the glass, with the consequence that most examples from the 1930s are now showing very noticeable signs of deterioration. No other component is likely to show such a range of deviation in condition and it is not therefore illogical that dial state, coupled with layout and degree of originality, has a greater bearing on commercial worth than all other factors. Cases can be repaired and non-working movements pulled back from the brink with expensive specialist work, but once a dial has become scruffy and stained, it can never again be regarded as both original and near mint. Hence those relatively few watches that exist with near perfect untouched dials command high prices when sold in the physical sales held by the major auction houses.\nThe dial on this watch is absolutely superb. It is guaranteed to be original and unrestored, yet its condition is as close to perfect as could ever be found. Scrutinised from a distance of a few millimetres with the aid of a jeweller\u2019s eyeglass, there is the very slightest ageing to the registers, but to dwell on this point would be to take criticism to a ludicrous extent. To all intents and purposes, this dial is as-new. Its silver white surface is not dirtied or foxed and the printing, in red, blue and black, has not faded with the passing of more than sixty years.\nA dial in this virgin state will command a premium and it represents a significant percentage of the asking price for this watch. The consensus of opinion is that approximately 40% of the commercial value of the best vintage watches lies in their dials and it is very noticeable that the pieces which attract the most attention in the traditional physical auction sales held by Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Bonhams are those with dials that are unmolested and still in first rate order.\n\u201cUniversal, Geneve\u201d is stated in black above the dial centre point. Prior to 1937, the simpler signature \u201cUniversal\u201d was used. Following on from the official change in the company\u2019s trading style from Universal Watch Co Limited to Universal Geneve in 1937, the double barrelled wording see here appeared on the firm\u2019s chronograph dials.\nAll five hands are original and in superb condition. Their blued steel finish is not at all corroded and is consistent with the excellent state of the rest of the piece. Finding the correct replacement hands for the lower production volume brands like Universal and IWC is very difficult and invariably turns out to be extremely pricey. In our early days in the business, we were occasionally tempted to buy watches that we knew had minor aspects that were incorrect, typically hands or winding crowns, and try to restore them back to factory standard specification. Such watches were often offered to us at what appeared at the time to be bargain prices, but in many instances, proved tremendously expensive to put back into first rate condition. We learnt our lesson many years ago and now only buy those pieces that are complete and correct in every detail. We always advise our customers that it is by far the best route to pay a little over the odds in the first instance and acquire something that is authentic and as it should be rather than cut corners and try to rectify a second rate vintage watch with components that may or may not ever be sourced in the future.\nTo return to the theme of the opening paragraph of this description, it is quite incredible that a vintage chronograph movement of this quality, which is literally second to none, can be purchased for such a small amount of money. Universal chronographs from this period undoubtedly contain some of the most exquisite mechanisms ever created, yet this example and others like it, can be bought for less than the asking price of many mass produced time-only watches offered new in the high street.\nThe movement in this watch is calibre 386, a hand wound chronograph with seventeen jewels that was built along classical lines, with an 18000 half beats per hour running speed and its start, stop and reset features controlled by means of a column wheel. While we deliberately avoid being overly technical on our website for fear of boring the casual observer, this is an important aspect that is worth some further explanation. In order that damage does not occur, it is clearly vital that these chronograph functions operate in sequence. In other words, for example, it is imperative that no attempt can ever be made to reset a running chronograph without first arresting its movement with the stop function. While beautifully made, the vintage chronographs by the elite houses like Universal are delicate and the forces involved when stopping and restarting are enough to wreak havoc with the chain of toothed gears and levers if not synchronized perfectly.\nThe crown wheel, equally correctly referred to as a column wheel, is the purist\u2019s method of chronograph guidance. In order to work, the relevant operating lever has to drop into its dedicated slot machined into the top of the column wheel. If this action is not performed, the respective start, stop or reset function cannot take place.\nWhile extremely elegant and very attractive to look at, crown wheel movements required a great deal of highly skilled hand finishing to ensure a perfect fit between this component and the levers that fitted into it and were expensive to manufacture, hence they were only offered by brands at the top of the price scale when new. The alternative system was lever actuation, which achieved the same results by means of a pivoting cam. Far cheaper to produce, the cam arrangement was widely adopted by makers who were more cost conscious and happy to depart from what had been the classical method of chronograph control since the Victorian pocket watch era.\nThe fact of the matter is that lever actuated cams worked just as well as crown wheels, but they lacked the charm and took away the opportunities to display superlative craftsmanship that were offered by the latter. The most prestigious makers, for which the eventual retail price of their watches was not a major concern, like Patek-Philippe, Rolex and indeed Universal, continued to create crown wheel chronographs while other, less eminent brands, would typically market chronographs that employed cam guidance. For the modern day collector wanting to own something truly outstanding, a classic 1930s or \u201840s crown wheel chronograph is an essential purchase and will be a source of great satisfaction.\nCalibre 386 will always be associated in the minds of enthusiasts with the Unicompax. Launched in 1936 it was effectively the junior version of the company\u2019s Compax that had made its debut a year earlier. Almost identical in appearance and of the same remarkable quality, the Compax differed slightly from the Unicompax on account of it having an additional 12 hour chronograph counter and a 30 minute register, as opposed to the single 45 minute register on the latter. Both variants are highly desirable, though it could be argued that the slightly simpler dial layout of the Unicompax has a certain extra period charm.\nMovements like this one were hand built and designed with the intention that they would be possessions for life. Their quality was so high that this objective was easily achieved provided that they were maintained correctly and sent for cleaning and re-lubrication every three or four years. The complexity of mechanical chronographs means that it is imperative that they are serviced periodically and if such work is not performed, they will suffer rapid premature wear. We regularly reject early chronographs offered to us on the basis that their neglected movements are well on the way to life expiry and it is so important to only buy an example like the piece here with a movement that is showing no signs of mechanical wear. Finished in distinctive frosted gilt, its appearance reminding us of a pre-War IWC unit, this movement gleams brightly and is not at all corroded or even tarnished.\nJust as important as condition, though the two factors are inextricably linked, is movement originality. Again, as movements become worn, there is an unfortunately tendency for unscrupulous dealers to repair them at low cost with non-standard components, often from related, but not the correct, calibres. This movement is guaranteed to be entirely standard and is today exactly as it was in 1939 when new.\nAs called for, \u201cUniversal Geneve\u201d is signed on the Y shaped bridge, with the calibre number 386 on the base plate. Operation is very smooth, with the start, stop and re-set functions performing with a definite crisp click. Everything here works perfectly and the watch runs without issue, both as a chronograph and as a standard timekeeper.\nWe have fitted this watch with a high quality crocodile skin type strap that perfectly suits its upmarket old world appearance. This is not a genuine Universal strap, but is very similar to those shown with the Compax and Unicompax models in Universal\u2019s advertising from the 1930s and early \u201840s. The strap is brand new and has never been worn.\nA lovely touch is the presence of the original box that this watch was supplied in back in 1939. Kendal & Dent was one of the most important retailers of fine horology during the inter-War period. An official agent for Rolex, Omega, IWC and Universal, this business offered high precision watches to both the public and the military. In itself, this box is a very collectible item. More information about Kendal & Dent, and in particular its proprietors F.E Coad and B.L Langman, can be found on page 180 of Tony Mercer\u2019s book \u201cChronometer Makers of the World\u201d.\nThe book \u201cChronograph Wristwatches-To Stop Time\u201d by Gerd R Lang includes quite a lot of information about Universal and its important role in the development of the luxury wristwatch chronograph as we know it today. There is an excellent large colour photograph of a Unicompax on page 135, with the watch shown from 1945, six years later than the piece for sale here. A close up of the classic Universal calibre 386 chronograph movement appears in the same book on page 236.\nThere is an excellent article in the April 2003 edition of \u201cWatchTime\u201d magazine by Gisbert Brunner, a highly respected horological historian and vintage watch collector, entitled \u201cThe 12 most beautiful chronograph movements of all time\u201d. Mr Brunner picks the dozen chronograph mechanisms that he feels are the finest ever made and includes an identical Universal chronograph calibre to the one inside this watch, the 287. Looking at the large colour photograph of the 287 in WatchTime ( page 110) and comparing it to the calibre 386 here, it is almost impossible to see any differences between the two and it seems fair to say that the latter is a very subtly refined version of the former.\nThe price of this watch is \u00a31685 GB pounds. The value for money that it represents is nothing short of astonishing and we cannot recommend it too strongly. It is a beautiful looking period piece that has been manufactured to a quality standard that has hardly ever been equalled. The only reason that vintage Universal chronographs from this era are so woefully undervalued is that the present Universal company has a very low profile and its classic work remains almost unknown to all but the most diehard aficionados. There is nothing about this watch that is inferior to its equivalent by Rolex, Omega or Patek-Philippe, yet the asking price for it here would only just cover the cost of a tidy 1950s steel Rolex Oyster in its most basic format. This is sheer horological excellence that can be acquired on a limited budget and it stands out as one of the very few models that have changed respective positions in the market place. When they were new, chronographs by Universal were among the most prestigious and most costly available and were found at Asprey, Cartier and Hermes. In fact, we have several Hermes adverts from the 1930s devoted entirely to Universal chronographs in our archives and we have used one as the background for one of the photographs accompanying this listing. The text makes great play of the fact that these can be purchased in the Hermes stores in Monaco, Biarritz, St. Tropez and Cannes, giving us a pretty good idea of the target audience for timepieces at this level. Rather anomalously in today\u2019s market, Universal has been forgotten which means, for the moment at least, before somebody resurrects this dormant glorious brand and raises its profile, exceptional early Universal chronographs like the one here are nothing short of bargains.",

    "text": "If the couple does not click, do not take it personally. You tried, and your intentions were good. Shrug your shoulders, and let it go. Maybe next time.\nAvoid getting too involved. Once you have introduced the couple, let things play out without further involvement on your part. It is up to the couple to decide whether or not they want to pursue another meeting. Their first encounter may go extremely well or it may blow up in flames. Either way, the ball is in their court\u2026 not yours.\nDo not throw people together randomly or just because they are both single. The only good reason for setting up two people is because you sincerely believe they would like each other. Before making your first move, find out if they have similar interests and what each individual is looking for in a relationship.\nAsk for permission first. Never ambush anyone with an impromptu setup. Make sure those involved are genuinely okay with your plans. If they decline, accept the refusal graciously.\nPlaying cupid or matchmaker for family or friends can be fun and rewarding, especially if romantic sparks fly. Helping two people find each other in this great big, hectic world is a wonderful thing to do for people you love and care about. You may be bringing together two people who are a perfect match but might never have found each other without your help. But setting up people you know well can also be an iffy undertaking because romantic chemistry is very hard to predict. Remember\u2026 love takes its own path. If you are considering playing matchmaker, think it through and tread a little carefully. You don\u2019t want to do anything that might have a negative effect on your relationship with either person.\nDitch any preconceived expectations. Just because you think two people are perfect for each other does not mean they will feel the same way. Even though heartfelt, your enthusiasm and eagerness might be a bit overwhelming. You could end up putting extra pressure on the couple, and possibly doom a relationship before it has a chance to plant roots and grow.\nBe completely honest. When describing each person to the other, full disclosure is essential. Talk about what a person is really like without trying to create an image that will appeal to the other person. If you don\u2019t know someone that well, let the other know. Share photos if you have them.",

    "text": "We played OGC in Dallas TX over the weekend. We drew the teams out of the hat the day prior and tasked each team with coming up with a theme.\nThe \u201cHawaiian Hula Girls\u201d won the day.\nGiven Dallas has a large number of bars with open patios in the area we played we had a lot of teams who were caught gazing into a patio area and had to stop on many more occasions for a pint then they had hoped for.\nIt has been a long time since we posted an OGC meeting, but that doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t been happening. Since Oxford, we\u2019ve played Islington and Borough, and I know of other matches played in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Stuttgart, New Haven, and Santa Cruz. Which just goes to show you can\u2019t keep a good chicken (cow, easter bunny, etc) down.\nGreat news everyone! All of chicken suit woman\u2019s friends have now turned up and they are knocking back bolly like there\u2019s no tomorrow!\nBut, on the plus side, the Trottwood had very pretty origami cranes hanging from the ceiling and casting their avian shadows over our celebration.\nNext up: Cambridge, the City, or the King\u2019s Road. Obviously also Spokane at some point.\nLovely all times she lies, especially during One Giant Chicken!\nOn Sunday 12 May a group of us convened on Oxford for an inaugural One Giant Chicken Varsity Match. We ended up with twenty people (3 who live in Oxford, 16 who live in London, 1 who lives in San Francisco). on an absolutely beautiful day.\nWe began at the Weatsheaf, a townie pub if ever there was one. Why? Because it\u2019s right in the middle of town, down an alleyway, and that way no unsuspecting non-Oxonian Chicken would wander in there. As it turned out, I had the good fortune of drawing my own name to be One Giant Chicken. I high-tailed it across Christ Church Meadow, down the Long Walk to the Head of the River. Where else could I go, really? It was a lovely spring day and that chicken costume is HOT. On the way, though, I was like the pied piper. Several toddlers (presumably mistaking me for Big Bird) tried to follow me on my merry way.\nAnyway, despite Oxford being a fantastic city in which to drink, we discovered some downsides for One Giant Chicken. The first was intentional: we declared all society bars out of bounds. That meant no college bars or butteries; nor could the chicken avail itself of Vinnies, the Union Bar, or the University Club. That left about 30 pubs/bars in the centre (see the boundaries we used below). We also made sure that an Oxonian was able to captain each team. And since I was chicken they had a pretty good hunch that I wasn\u2019t going to be some place dreadful like the Mitre or Maxwells.\nOf course, my being chicken also gave Andrew\u2019s team an unfair advantage, which he exploited. Nice day + my preference for a pleasant afternoon = head to the pub with the best patio. And there they found me, almost immediately. Sigh. Alana took a picture to prove that they\u2019d won, but we were tricksy and did it inside, with the giant fireplace behind me, which did indeed throw some of the others.\nAfter which they found us very quickly (though they still did Strawpedos at the Old Tom on their way south). For those of you forgetting your ancient Egyptian mythology, that\u2019s Isis, the namesake of the River Thames in Oxford.\nOGC might actually be best played in venues where the majority of participants don\u2019t know the majority of the drinking establishments. Otherwise it risks being rather predictable.\nPlaying on a beautiful day is great, but you should be aware that chickens like beer gardens, and that can narrow down the options.\nNo one in Oxford bats an eyelash at a grown man wearing a chicken costume at a pub mid-afternoon whilst reading the London Review of Books. No one even asked me what was going on.\nMy friend Allison told me about One Giant Chicken over Christmas. My first reaction was \u201cwhy did I not think of this?!\u201d. My second reaction was \u201cmy friends will love this game.\u201d And so we set about trying to find a time when we could have a go at it. Unfortunately, what with a honeymoon for the bulk of January and a busy February for both myself and Andrew, we couldn\u2019t actually make our first OGC run until today.\nSuffice to say it was worth the wait. We chose Soho for its central location, its large number of pubs, and its easy-to-define boundaries (see below). We invited a large group of friends through Faceboard, and we met at the Crown and Two Chairman, a favourite pub amongst our group of friends. Dottie was so excited about the game that she had found and printed out lists of Soho\u2019s 48 pubs. And so it seemed appropriate that fate would select her to be our first Giant Chicken.\nShe disappeared down the street in heels and a chicken costume and soon sent an infuriating photo of a bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice\u2026and off we went.\nIt\u2019s not bad to group teams according to how aggressively they want to drink.\nIf you have a friend that tends to get belligerent when drunk, don\u2019t let them order things at the bar.\nKeep in mind that most chicken suits don\u2019t have pockets.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pee whilst wearing the suit. That\u2019s just tough luck for the chicken.",

    "text": "Let\u2019s get right to it: just because everyone\u2019s talking about data visualization and data analysis and big data doesn\u2019t mean that any of it\u2019s easy.\nThe problem with using data to make decisions or to tell stories is that you have to have data in the first place.\nAnd that\u2019s where the idea of \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d in data comes from: if you have bad data, you\u2019re going to end up with bad analysis.\nThe best part of having data is using it to make decisions. But if you have bad data, the truth is that you\u2019re only going to make bad--or at the very least, uninformed--decisions.\nMost business intelligence and data visualization platforms are BYOD (bring your own data).\nBYOD can be a tough system when you\u2019re trying to extract value out of data though because the process of cleaning data and making it usable for analysis (called ETL, which is short for \u201cextract, transform, and load\u201d) is a long and winding road.\nGetting good data (or trying to turn bad data into good data) isn\u2019t easy--or fun. That\u2019s coming from the two types of people who often get saddled with this job: the data scientist and the business intelligence professional or analyst.\nAnd they also consider those two parts of the process to be the least fun parts of the job.\nIn a perfect world, you\u2019d have perfect data that\u2019s always clean--no blanks, no special characters, no accidentally double-counted assets. Everything would add up and your assets subtracted by your liabilities would be one beautiful zero.\nBut in an imperfect world, we find workarounds.\nIf the data that you want to analyze doesn\u2019t have to be something you generate or own, find a platform that aggregates all of that data already and has it cleaned and organized, just ripe for your analyzing pleasure. If it has visualization and analysis tools built-in? Even better.\nLet someone else do the data collection and upkeep for you, so all you have to do is explore and find insights--the fun parts.\nWhen you\u2019re looking at data analysis and business intelligence tools, it might feel like BYOD is your only option. But depending on the type of analysis you want to do, looking for a platform that comes with its own extensive dataset could be your best bet.\nPharma companies spend a lot of money in R&D--more than almost any other industry. And the R&D ratio (R&D compared to revenue) is interesting because it can tell us how invested in new product development one company is compared to another.",

    "text": "I have an issue for which I created a workaround, but now it doesn't work anymore and I don't know to how to solve it... So I hope someone has the same problem and knows a proper solution.\nIn my dashboard I have a map with locations, a small report and multiple filters which apply to both the report and the map. Many records in my data source have the same longitude and latitude, so they are blended as one spot on the map. I want to display only the spots on the map and in the report if they require a certain number of records. So far no problems. But here comes the difficulty... Each individual record in my data source contains a hyperlink and I want to show all urls that belong to the spot on the map. Preferably clickable as wel.\nThe workaround I created was to make an extra sheet/list with all my hyperlinks as a simple table. When I used the map or the report as a filter, this sheet was filtered as well. I added this sheet as an extra dashboard and linked the dashboards to each other. But now I don't want to use the map or report as a filter, but just the number of records in my dashboard. When I use a certain number of records as a filter for the map and report, my 'table list' sheet with hyperlinks is empty because it shows only individual records. So when I use for instance a filter for a minimum of 20 records per spot on the map and report, my corresponding list with individual hyperlinks is empty, because this list displays individual records.\nI attatched a sample workbook which represents my problem. In this workbook the filter for minimum number of records is applied only to the map and not to the report list.\nHope someone has the same problem and knows a good workaround!\nAre you still looking for help with this?\nIn sheet 3 I made a calc ([Calculation1]) that builds a string, adding on the current hyperlink to a growing list of the prior hyperlinks.\nOn V3 of sheet 3 I just made a simple sheet of all lat/long combos and their hyperlinks. I used the new 10.5 sheet-in-a-tooltip feature that lets you display a sheet in a tooltip. Go to your MAP sheet. Hover or click on a city. There is the sheet! At this time we can't click into a sheet-in-a-tooltip though.\nSo these are some ways to address what you are looking to do.\nI still needed an answer to my question so... thanks very much for your clear explanation and examples! I helped me a lot!\nThere's just one thing I don't understand how you did it. In Dashboard 2, how did you made the filter action that only displays the sheet when you click a city on the map?\nBut I still got the problem with filtering the minimum number of records. When I change the minimum number of records parameter in your workbook to 2 for example, both the tooltip and the hyperlinks list are empty. I hope you can help me with that part as well!\nLet me first address the question about Dashboard 2.\nI made a filter action with the Source being the Map sheet, and the Target being my new sheet. I specifically pass selected fields of Lat and Long. So in my sheet, only the rows that correspond with those values display.\nThe key thing is to check \"Exclude all values\" as shown below. That way the little report sheet clears out when you clear the selection off the Map sheet. And then I can just pass the hyperlink field (as you did on Dashboard 1) to the hyperlink action (Hyperlink 2) to get to the link.\nRegarding the filter... That is evaluating at the row level. So for every row, the value for Number of Records is always 1.\nI created a FIXED LOD to tell me how many rows are for each lat/long. See [Rows for Lat/Long]. Then I modified the [FILTER...] calc to use that instead. (I also displayed both SUM([Number of Records]) and [Rows for Lat/Long] on the map, and on my report sheet so you can see how they behave at the row level. (On the MAP sheet you are not displaying at the row level, so they get rolled up to the mark level for lat/long, and that's why you see 3 or 10, etc. But on my sheet I display at the row level (so that individual hyperlinks are accessible to the hyperlink2 action) and there you can see why number of records is 1, but the LOD value is still 3 .\nThanks for your super super super clear explanation!!! I never heard of the FIXED LOD function. This really solves my issue and also contributes to my Tableau knowlegde a lot!\nI was wondering if you also know if it is possible to show all results from Sheet3 (4) when no selection for a location on the map is made.\nSo for instance if my Minimum # records is 1, I would like so show the full list of Sheet3(4), and when I change the Minimum # records to 5, to show just the results that belong to this filter.\nEdit: I still needed to apply the new filter to all sheets, now it's working. Thank's a lot!\nI still got another question. The workbook I added to this question is just a 'simple' version from my original one. The original one I can't share because of privacy reasons.\nBut in my original workbook, I got a lot of filters. And the problem that I'm facing right now, is that the value for the \"Rows for Lat/Long\" has the value for all records in the data source, but my filters don't apply to this calculated field. I tried adding all filters to the \"Rows for Lat/Long\" calculated field, but I still don't get it working properly.\nI made another workbook with an editted data source so I can show you what I mean. In Dashboard(2), for instance, if I check just \"me\" in the filter \"person\" the Number of Records and Rows for Lat/Long don't have the same value, but I want them to.\nYou know a solution for this problem as well?\nThe [Rows for lat/long] calc is a FIXED LOD calc. When we do FIXED, in most cases it acts BEFORE any filters are invoked.\nFIXED does calcs on the full set of data coming in from the data source -- except for certain circumstances.\nIf you want LODs to be affected by the filters, usually we go to INCLUDE and EXCLUDE LODs. These get evaluated AFTER the filters are applied.\nThey can also be a little more confusing to get right.\nAfter you put a filter in context, the pill on the filter shelf changes to a grey color to let you know it is in context.\nAttached is your workbook with that filter in context.\nThanks Joe for your very clear explaination!\nI still got a lot to learn I see... Thank you!",

These unofficial reports are coming from the El Rosario Sanctuary in Mexico (see video example from 2016 at the end of this post); a site that can sometimes be the winter home for over 50% of the entire monarch population in Mexico. Reports and photos show butterflies densely covering approximately 18 trees. That\u2019s good news, but last year, reports were that 50 trees were covered.\nThat\u2019s not good news, but it is a call to action: PLANT MORE MILKWEED!\nHumans are a fickle bunch, and try as I might, they are hard to figure. Say one thing, mean another. Say one thing, find out it wasn\u2019t true. Commit to one thing, then change courses. Not saying I\u2019m any different, but the dependability of nature (well maybe not weather) is something that brings me a lot of comfort. Cycles that repeat; you sort of come to depend on them. Geese come south, geese go north. Jenny wrens nesting in the same clay pots they used the year before. My mother in law\u2019s daffodils emerging in late February, as they have been since she planted 30+ years ago. Even the sturgeon have decided the river is clean enough to make a comeback.

    "text": "The industry is anticipated to almost triple in size in the coming years with the market expected to reach US $9.7 billion by the year 2022.\nGlobal Ayurveda Summit in Kochi found that 77 percent of Indian households used them in 2017. This is up from 69 percent of households in 2015.\nThe rise of ayurveda is being fuelled by growing emphasis on the importance of healthy lifestyles, suggested the report prepared by Powerwaterhouse Coopers (PwC) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).\nThis is against the backdrop of India\u2019s rising rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which the report credits with encouraging more and more people to look after their health.\nTo this end, many Indians are turning to Ayurveda and other alternative medicine systems and treatments, such as unani, siddha, naturopathy, and homoeopathy.\nSpeaking at the event, Governor of Kerala P Sathasivam welcomed the news. He spoke positively of the Centre \u201c[giving] priority to mainstreaming indigenous medicine systems\u201d in the 2017 National Health Policy.\nHe credited this with giving \u201ca policy boost\u201d to \u201cIndian medicine systems, such as Ayurveda.\u201d The state was identified in the report as being well-positioned to lead the growth of ayurveda in the coming years.\nTo build on the industry\u2019s growth in India, PwC and the CII encouraged the use of technologyby the ayurvedic industry to satisfy demand. It also said that quality control standards need to be enforced if ayurveda is to be successfully launched at the international level.\nThe Centre has been keen to promote traditional systems of medicine in recent years. It established the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in 2014.\nThe Modi government has been keen to promote AYUSH both at home and abroad, constructing state-of-the-art homoeopathic laboratories and showcasing the industry at international conferences.\nThis is fuelling growing uptake of AYUSH. Not only do 77 percent of households use Ayurveda, there has been a fifty percent increase in patients seeking homoeopathic treatment in the past five years.\nAYUSH\u2019s increased popularity is being observed not only among Indians, but also among international visitors. Some analysts have credited AYUSH with driving \u2013 at least in part \u2013 the rapid growth of India\u2019s medical tourism industry.\nThis is not to say that AYUSH treatments cannot be of some public health benefit. For example, homoeopathic treatments may lessen overreliance on antibiotics and other medicaments for ailments such as the common cold.\nSome evidence has been produced, suggesting the merit of alternative approaches such as music therapy to mental healthcare, as well as the potential value of turmeric in the fights against arthritis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThere is a clear scientific consensus surrounding the limitations of what AYUSH can offer in terms of health. As such, the rising popularity of such treatments may seem baffling to some.\nYet the industry\u2019s continual growth on the backbone of near-incessant government promotion and largely positive coverage in the media does seem to indicate that, for the foreseeable future, AYUSH is here to stay.",

Along with blood pressure and glucose (blood sugar), it\u2019s a factor that you have to keep under control for the sake of your cardiovascular system. What\u2019s more, this waxy material seems to have other ominous connections: A recent study found a link between even moderately elevated cholesterol levels at mid-life and dementia risk in old age.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, total cholesterol levels below 200 mg/dL are desirable. Levels of 240 and above are high risk; anything between 200 and 240 represents a borderline risk area. For LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol, less than 100 is good, 190 and above is very high risk, and anything in between falls into a pattern of increasing risk (100-129, near optimal; 130-159, borderline high; 160-189, high). Conversely, you want higher levels of HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol\u2014less than 40 for men and 50 for women increases heart disease risk.\nCholesterol imbalances are harmful because they contribute to atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaques within arteries that slow blood flow. LDL can become oxidized, a process similar to the rusting of metal. When it does, it can become stuck in the tissue that lines arterial walls. The presence of LDL in arteries attracts blood cells called platelets, which attempt to make repairs; this process causes inflammation, which in turn further stimulates plaque development. Sometimes the plaque becomes unstable, or prone to rupture. If it ruptures a clot can form at the site, which can lead to a heart attack (in the coronary arteries) or stroke (in arteries feeding the brain). HDL, the \u201cgood\u201d form of cholesterol, helps shepherd LDL back to the liver for processing.\nWhile atherosclerosis is best known for its cardiovascular consequences, it can cause symptoms elsewhere in the body\u2014anywhere blood flow is reduced by plaque-laden arteries. Plaque buildup in pelvic arteries can lead to erectile dysfunction (ED) in men and is strongly suspected of causing sexual dysfunction in women. Reduced blood supply in the arms and legs, a condition known as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), can cause numbness, weakness and pain.\nNot smoking. That should go without saying.\nAvoiding such dietary hazards as heavily refined foods (including white bread, pasta, rice and sugar), excessive amounts of table salt and saturated fat, and food grown or processed with pesticides, antibiotics or preservatives.\nNot drinking or, at the very least, limiting your alcohol intake. The same goes for caffeine, which acts as a stimulant and diuretic.\nRegular relief of stress, which has been linked to inflammation. Meditation, tai chi, yoga and plain \u2019ol exercise are all known to reduce stress.\nExercise for its own sake; physical activity helps lower both total and LDL while raising HDL.",

    "text": "Often referred to as the toxic legacy of our digital generation, e-waste has fast emerged as one of the most pressing issues on the environmental and health front in India\u2019s path to development. A couple of months ago, the United Nations reported an alarming statistic that the world generated 44.7 million tonnes \u2013 equivalent to the weight of 4,500 Eiffel Towers. Out of this, India\u2019s contribution was a significant 2 million tonnes. To add to this, another disturbing fact is that 95% of this e-waste remains treated informally.\nThe health and environmental effects of electronic waste are well-documented with toxic metals not limited to lead, mercury, and cadmium, resulting in birth defects, brain, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal system damage. In addition to this, e-waste can cause environmental deterioration by way of air, water and soil pollution.\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) defines 'e-waste' as \u201celectrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part discarded as waste by the consumer or bulk consumer as well as rejects from manufacturing, refurbishment and repair processes.\u201d To tackle this problem, the MoEF introduced the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in 2016, whereby the responsibility to collect and channel e-waste from consumers to authorized recycling units was placed with the electronics manufacturing companies and bulk consumers. Although e-waste management laws have been in place since 2011, firms are now required to set yearly collection targets linked to their production numbers.\nIn 2016 (followed by amendments in 2018), the MoEF clearly defined that the phase-wise collection targets for e-waste in weight shall be 10% of the quantity of waste generation as indicated in the EPR Plan during 2017-18, with a 10% increase every year until 2023.\nAfter 2023, the target has been made 70% of the quantity of waste generation as indicated in the EPR Plan. This can be undertaken by way of Individual Producer Responsibility (IPR) or Collective Producer Responsibility (CPR). In case of the latter, the organization can delegate its compliance organization to a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO).\nWhile the Government policies have been geared towards making sincere efforts to address this pertinent issue, the on-ground reality remains far from the ideal scenario. There is a severe lack of awareness among the producers and consumers, dearth of requisite infrastructure and absence of regulatory enforcement agencies.\nAn innovative way to look at this problem is to make a business case for it. As the basic principle of economics states, people and organizations respond to incentives. The three principles that must be adhered are those of accountability, business transformation and systems thinking.\nAwareness is of utmost importance to get the ball rolling but there are several challenges faced by both producers and bulk consumers that hinder proactive participation. The large-scale producers do not wish to be the first to transform their business, while the process is plagued by the evils of corruption and malfeasance. The medium-scale and small-scale producers, on the other hand, regard e-waste as a tick box in the event of production and do not attempt to engage in the process holistically and take the effort to build awareness.\nAlthough the informal waste pickers, aggregators and dismantlers are willing to enter the fold of formalization, the formal sector faces several challenges. These challenges range from lack of handling capacity to illegitimate facilities in the forms of multiple accounting of waste, selling to aggregators and leakages. There is sufficient evidence for a burgeoning business opportunity, creating an untapped potential for innovators to come up with unique business propositions to address this menace.\nWe need to develop tracking mechanisms and provide oversight of e-waste compliance, in order to ensure that the mechanism of e-waste disposal is streamlined as much as possible. While enforcement strictness is of paramount importance, it is also vital to build an incentive structure around this to ensure better complicity by the producers. This is an area where the policymakers can step in and highlight opportunities underlying this perceived compliance evil for producers.\nThe time is ripe for innovators to come up with propositions that bridge the gap between the compliance necessity faced by producers and the strong will of the Government to rid the toxic e-waste in a sustainable and safe manner.",

    "text": "The most basic principles of Christianity taught by Jesus The Christ apparently is much too difficult for avowed members of the Christian Right. The hate and vitriol from the Christian Right against certain members of the human race defy and rebuke many of the beliefs held by Christ.\nBut even when the positions conservative Christians take are not steeped in vitriol and hate, their inability to embrace Christ's basic principles seem difficult ponderous, and mysterious to them.\nWhen this Stephen Colbert quote was posted on various Facebook pages, the outrage from the conservative right was quick and unapologetic. The venom and hate from some corners in the defense of reasons to avoid helping the poor and needy apparently stem the conservative belief that helping the poor means rewarding lazy liberals, lazy blacks, and illegal brown immigrants for their worthlessness and laziness. Poor lazy white conservatives often are excluded from this diatribe or are not deemed to be a problem.\nOne conservative Christian's response to the Stephen Colbert posting on Facebook, however, was absent any directed vitriol. It was a statement that had the connotative air of a question. She simply said, \"That depends on what we mean by helping\". Taken out of context, it is a curious comment from a professed Christian. But, in the context of the conservative brain, it was a genuine attempt to ask an honest question.\nWhat she really wanted to know is how can conservatives help the poor without letting lazy neer-do-well liberals, blacks, and illegal immigrants steal my hard earned money. Likely, most liberal have no problems with the same question as long as it is applied to both sides of the political divide and all parts of the racial and ethnic spectrum.\nAmerica would be a better America if the Christian Right would direct as much vitriol and venom toward wealthy CEOs of greedy, job killing, union busting, low wage paying, middle class destroying, off shore banking, affordable health care denying, job outsourcing corporations that pay little or no taxes and receive more money from the public treasury than do the poor.\nOur system of government assistance can be improved to curtail waste and cheating. but it will happen if and only if elected members in the Senate and the House of Representatives work on the same issues with the same intent and without the weight of political grandstanding. Welfare cheaters should be eliminated. Some are too lazy to work. Some children who grow up depending on welfare do become adults who see government assistance as an entitlement that they pass on to their children.\nHowever, not everyone who receives public assistance in the form of federal and state dollars are lazy blacks and illegal brown immigrants. Most are white Americans. Some are lazy white conservatives on the Christian right living in states that vote for conservative Republicans--states that year in and year out receive more in federal dollars that they pay in federal taxes. Neverthess, the amount of waste received by the poor, including the needy and working class cheaters pales in comparison to the billions received by corporations who give nothing back or at best give very little back.\nJesus said that that the poor will always be with us. But did Jesus Christ place any angry conditions on helping the poor and needy? Would The Christ have problems with any of these examples of aid to the poor?\n1. Giving aid to a person or to a family that finds itself in dire straits. Like the parable of the good Samaritan, isn't that the Christian thing to do?\n2. Providing public assistance whose goal is to lift the spirit and physical well being of the poor and needy.\n3. Offering government assistance to provide additional educational opportunity and cultural experiences that give hope and help lift poor children--red, white, yellow, black, and brown--out of poverty.\n4. Providing public assistance to any segment of society that, without that assistance, would remain in dire straits.\nHelping does not mean giving poor lazy people the right to feed from the public treasury to get rich or even to get along without engaging in available work. It does not mean giving money to undeserving undesirables on either side of the political divide. On the other hand we understand that no effort to contribute to the common good is totally free from pitfalls and potential abuse by the poor, the not so poor, and the very rich--abuse we all should be willilng to guard against and help eliminate.\nBut, as Stephen Colbert so eloquently said: \"If this is going to be a Christian nation that doesn't help the poor, either we have to pretend that Jesus was just as selfish as we are, or we've got to acknowledge that He commanded us to love the poor and serve the needy without condition and then admit that we just don't want to do it\".",

    "text": "Recent developments in several industrial economies, particularly in the three largest ones, raise important issues about how to judge the stance of monetary policy. In the United States, recovery from the recent recession has been exceptionally sluggish, whereas inflation has fallen to its lowest level in two decades. In Japan, growth has slowed considerably during the past eighteen months. In Germany, by contrast, inflationary pressures surged in 1991\u201392 following unification, although more recently growth has stagnated. At the same time, the evolution of broad monetary aggregates\u2014which the monetary authorities have preferred to target or monitor\u2014suggests that monetary conditions have been tight in the United States and Japan but easy in Germany. But other indicators\u2014including nominal and real short-term interest rates, the slope of yield curves, and narrow monetary aggregates\u2014suggest that monetary policy has eased in the United States and in Japan, whereas it has tightened significantly in Germany.\nThis annex examines the experiences of these three countries and, more briefly, those of selected other industrial economies in order to assess the reliability of indicators of the stance of monetary policy. The analysis shows that contradictions among the various indicators, as is now the case, often occur over the course of the business cycle. Moreover, the growth of the broad monetary aggregates now appears to be giving misleading indications of the true stance of monetary policy and of its probable effect on future growth and inflation. Appropriately assessing the stance of monetary policy and the need for policy adjustments therefore requires examination of a range of indicators.\nIn the United States, the recovery from the recession that began in the third quarter of 1990 has been unusually sluggish by historical standards: growth in the first four quarters following the trough has been only about half that in the weakest previous postwar recovery (Chart 20). Although several factors have contributed to this disappointing performance, there has been concern that the slow growth of M2, which has fallen below the bottom of the Federal Reserve\u2019s target band, indicates that monetary policy has not eased enough to sustain a robust recovery (Chart 21). This behavior apparently contrasts with earlier experience, when a fall in velocity, typically due to a surge in M2, has usually preceded a pickup in output growth by about four quarters.\n1As identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nThe recent behavior of M2 has been sufficiently unusual to suggest that this aggregate may no longer be very useful for assessing the stance of monetary policy.1 During the 1970s, a positively sloped yield curve was associated with rapid growth of M2 relative to M1. After financial deregulation in the 1980s, however, this relationship apparently broke down; since the mid-1980s, an inverted yield curve has been associated with rapid growth of M2 relative to M1. The recent pattern reflects the fact that low short-term interest rates and high long-term rates reduce the attractiveness of short-term assets in M2 relative to both demand deposits and longer-term assets, thereby reducing the growth of M2.\nOther factors have also contributed to the recent slowdown in the growth of M2. On the demand side, households and businesses may have been liquidating short-term assets in order to reduce their debt burden by paying down loans. On the supply side, depository institutions have been increasing the spread between the return on assets (loans) and the cost of liabilities (deposits, including time deposits) in response to low profitability, regulatory pressure to boost capital-asset ratios, slack loan demand during the recession and subsequent period of slow growth, and the perception that some loans are now riskier than before. As banks have consolidated the asset side of their balance sheets, they have had less need to raise funds and therefore have offered relatively low returns on instruments such as time deposits. Finally, asset shifts associated with closures of insolvent savings and loan institutions have reportedly slowed the growth of monetary aggregates.\nIndicators other than M2 suggest that the stance of monetary policy in the United States has eased substantially. In particular, the narrow aggregate M1 has been growing robustly, and the dollar has weakened as short-term nominal interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels in three decades. Short-term real interest rates are now close to zero, the lowest level since real interest rates were negative in the early 1980s. Long-term interest rates, however, have fallen only modestly, resulting in a very steep yield curve. In contrast to the often confusing signals provided by monetary aggregates, the yield curve has proved to be a reliable indicator of economic activity, with a lag of about four quarters.2 In the 1974\u201375 recession, the yield curve became steeply inverted about four quarters before output growth turned negative; it then became positive as output recovered. A similar pattern occurred in the 1981\u201382 recession. The recent steepness of the yield curve has been signaling an upturn in economic activity for some time and is consistent with a recovery in output growth in 1993, although the process of resolving private sector balance sheet difficulties may continue to restrain the pace of expansion.\nIn Japan, as in the United States, the monetary aggregate monitored by the central bank (M2 + CD) has barely grown over the past eighteen months, suggesting very tight monetary conditions (Chart 22).3 This slow growth was preceded by unusually rapid growth in 1990, however, and to that extent may reflect a return of the aggregate to its underlying trend. The evolution of the monetary aggregates was also influenced by the sharp rise in market interest rates in 1990 and their subsequent decline through 1991. As interest rates rose in 1990, funds were shifted out of postal deposits, which are not included in M2 + CD, because returns did not rise as quickly as interest rates paid on other assets. Prime lending rates also rose more slowly than market rates in late 1990 and early 1991; in response, firms borrowed at prime and reinvested in CDs. As interest rates fell during 1991, funds were shifted back into postal deposits, and firms unwound their positions in CDs, with the result that growth of M2 + CD was unusually slow.\n1 CD, certificate of deposit.\nIndicators other than M2 + CD suggest that the stance of monetary policy has loosened somewhat. The growth of the narrow aggregate M1 increased during 1990\u201391 and, although it declined somewhat in 1992, it was at about the same level as average growth in the 1980s. In addition, short-term rates have fallen by over 300 basis points in the past eighteen months in Japan, and real short-term interest rates are at their lowest level in more than a decade (except for a brief period in 1989). Short-term rates have also fallen about a percentage point below long-term rates. As in other countries, a positively sloped yield curve is associated with high growth of the narrow aggregate compared with the broad one.\nHowever, the factors underlying the recent behavior of monetary aggregates and other indicators in Japan are not completely understood, and it is therefore unusually difficult to judge whether current monetary conditions can sustain adequate growth in 1993. In particular, as in several other industrial countries, the collapse of equity and real estate prices has eroded the capital base of the banking sector, has resulted in a rise in nonperforming loans, and may also be depressing household consumption. The prospect that these effects may prove as pervasive and long-lasting as in other industrial countries suggests that the current stance of monetary policy in Japan is not overly expansionary.\nIn Germany, the twelve-month growth rates of the broad monetary aggregate M3 during the first nine months of 1992 were running well above the target range of 3.5 to 5.5 percent established by the Bundesbank (Chart 23).4 The rapid growth of M3 has been cited as an indication that monetary policy has been too loose. By contrast, following an upward surge during 1991 because of German monetary unification, M1 grew relatively moderately, despite a probable increase in the use of the deutsche mark in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Although moderate M1 growth suggests tight monetary policy, the divergence between the growth rates of the aggregates has complicated the assessment of the stance of policy. Historically, M3 has tended to grow more rapidly than M1 in response to a flattening or inversion of the yield curve\u2014as has occurred during the past two years\u2014because relatively high short-term rates increase the attractiveness of the short-term interest-bearing assets in M3. In addition, the prospect of the introduction of a withholding tax on interest income in mid-1992 may have induced movement out of longer-term assets and into the relatively liquid interest-bearing assets contained in M3.\nMonetary unification has made movements in both the narrow and broad monetary aggregates misleading as indicators of monetary stance.5 In addition to a substantial once-and-for-all increase in money stocks of perhaps 15 percent, unification increased the demand for money from the eastern L\u00e4nder. It will be difficult to evaluate how the behavior of asset holders and borrowers in east Germany will evolve; hence, the growth rates of the monetary aggregates may prove to be misleading guides to underlying economic conditions.\nWhereas M3 and M1 have been providing mixed signals, other indicators suggest that monetary policy in Germany is now quite tight. Short-term nominal and, more important, real interest rates are very high by postwar standards. This has put considerable upward pressure on the deutsche mark and contributed to the recent turmoil in the ERM. Short-term interest rates are also now well above long-term rates, resulting in a yield curve that is as steeply inverted as at any time in recent history. As in the United States, an inverted yield curve has been a reliable indicator that monetary policy is exerting significant downward pressure on output growth.\nTwo previous episodes of inflationary pressure followed by monetary tightening are helpful in assessing the indicators of monetary stance. Germany experienced a surge of inflationary pressure in the early 1970s, as did other countries. In response, the Bundesbank raised nominal and real short-term interest rates, and the yield curve became steeply inverted. The downturn of economic activity in Germany during 1974\u201375 and the subsequent reduction of inflation testify to the success of the tight stance of monetary policy. Nonetheless, M3 continued to grow rapidly from early 1973 through late 1974, even as M1 growth collapsed. In 1979, the second oil shock triggered another inflationary upsurge, which was again accompanied by a tightening of monetary conditions. As in 1973\u201374, the growth of M1 fell sharply, even turning negative in 1981, whereas the growth rate of M3 remained relatively stable. The yield curve became inverted as short rates rose sharply, and, as in the previous episode, this was followed by a fall in output, although the disinflationary impact may have been blunted by the fall in the value of the deutsche mark relative to the dollar, which reflected in part very tight monetary policy in the United States. In light of both of these episodes, the current monetary indicators suggest a slowing of the German economy and receding inflationary pressures.\nRecent difficulties in interpreting the behavior of monetary aggregates have not been limited to the three largest economies. In the United Kingdom, rising inflation became a key policy concern by late 1988, particularly in view of the prospect of entry into the ERM (which occurred in 1990). Monetary policy, which has used MO as the only targeted aggregate since 1987, was tightened considerably beginning in 1988 and over the course of 1989, remained tight through most of 1990, and then eased modestly beginning in late 1990. Short-term rates were pushed well above long-term rates from mid-1988 through late 1990 and then eased gradually to only about a percentage point above long-term rates during 1991, although they remained very high in real terms. In response, economic growth slackened somewhat during 1989, and a prolonged recession began in the third quarter of 1990. Meanwhile, inflation (measured by the \u201cheadline\u201d twelve-month change in the retail price index) has fallen below 4 percent.\nThe growth of the broad monetary aggregate M4 remained high relative to that of the narrow aggregate throughout 1989 and into 1990. As economic activity began to weaken, the growth of M4 fell to levels not seen since the 1960s, suggesting an economy declining into a deepening recession. In contrast, the growth of the narrower aggregate began to fall in mid-1988, providing a more reliable indication of the earlier tightening of monetary stance in 1988 and 1989. The recent behavior of narrow money suggests an economy that is only barely growing. The situation in the United Kingdom in 1989 and early 1990 was thus similar to the current situation in Germany: a tight monetary stance accompanied by rapid growth of broad monetary aggregates. Monetary conditions were eased following the pound sterling\u2019s entry into the ERM in late 1990, with short-term interest rates falling from 15 percent to 9\u00bd percent in September 1992. Since sterling left the ERM, short-term rates fell further to 7\u00bc percent in early December\u2014about 1 percentage point below long-term rates\u2014and the pound has depreciated in effective terms by about 16 percent. These changes amount to a substantial easing of monetary conditions and should stimulate economic activity in 1993.\nIn Canada, where no monetary aggregate is targeted, inflation became the key policy concern during 1988\u201390, and monetary policy tightened considerably. Short-term interest rates were pushed up from mid-1988 until mid-1990 and stood more than 2\u00bd percentage points above long-term rates from early 1989 until late 1990. As the economy slowed and inflation eased, short-term rates fell more than 700 basis points and were about 3 percentage points below long-term rates in August 1992. From already low levels in 1988, growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 declined further during 1989 and turned negative during 1990. In contrast, growth of the broad monetary aggregate picked up over the course of 1988\u201389, reached a peak for the decade at the end of 1989, and remained high through 1990. Since early 1991, growth of the broad aggregate has declined somewhat, whereas the growth of the narrow aggregate has picked up. The evolution of real output growth, which began to slow in late 1989 and turned negative in mid-1990, confirms the assessment of monetary policy indicated by the behavior of interest rates and the narrow aggregate. The behavior of the broad aggregate, in contrast, has been less useful as a guide to the impact of policy.\nIn Australia, determined efforts to combat inflation were clearly under way during 1989 as interest rates on short-term treasury bills were pushed to nearly 18 percent, 4 percentage points above long-term rates. The twelve-month growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 declined sharply from 36 percent at the beginning of 1989 to slightly below zero in early 1990. In contrast, the twelve-month growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3 rose to a peak of over 30 percent in mid-1989, ran above 20 percent by year-end, and was above 10 percent throughout 1990. Growth began to slow late in 1989; by mid-1990 a recession had begun, and inflation was falling. Again, the narrow aggregate appears to have reflected the stance of monetary policy more accurately than has the broad aggregate. The recovery that began in late 1991 is consistent with the sharp pickup in growth of the narrow aggregate, the persistent declines in short-term interest rates, and the increasingly positive slope of the yield curve since early 1991. At the same time, the broad aggregate has grown only slowly.\nSeptember 1990 Staff Studies for the World Economic Outlook, by the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund.\nOctober 1990 World Economic Outlook: A Survey by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund.\nNovember 1990 Multilateral Official Debt Rescheduling: Recent Experience, by Michael G.

Ford.\nM1 comprises demand deposits at commercial banks and currency. M2 comprises M1, savings deposits, overnight repurchases and Eurodollars, small time deposits, and money market mutual shares. The recent slowdown in M2 growth has been concentrated in small time deposits, which are interest-bearing, nonliquid instruments issued in denominations of less than $100,000. See the analysis in John Wenninger and John Partlan, \u201cSmall Time Deposits and the Recent Weakness of M2,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of New York Quarterly Review, Vol. 17 (Spring 1992), pp. 21\u201335.\nFor econometric evidence, see Arturo Estrella and Gikas A. Hardouvelis, \u201cThe Term Structure as a Predictor of Real Economic Activity,\u201d Journal of Finance, Vol. 46 (June 1991), pp. 555\u201376. They find that the term structure is a better predictor of real output than the short-term real interest rate and the index of leading indicators.\nM1 comprises currency and demand deposits. M2 + CD comprises M1, all other deposits with financial institutions, and certificates of deposit (CDs).\nM1 comprises \u201csight\u201d deposits and currency. M3 comprises M1, time deposits, funds borrowed for a period of less than four years, and savings deposits. The Bundesbank\u2019s target range is based on an estimate of potential output growth and on the medium-term target of price stability.\nOne sign of potential instability in money demand is the clear break in the relationship between monetary aggregates and nominal income. The steady decline in M3 velocity has been reversed since sometime in 1989, even after adjusting money stocks for the once-and-for-all change associated with unification.\nOn the first point, see Jeroen J.M. Kremers and Timothy D. Lane, \u201cEconomic and Monetary Integration and the Aggregate Demand for Money in the EMS,\u201d Staff Papers (IMF), Vol. 27 (December 1990), pp. 777\u2013805, and the references contained therein. On the second point, see Tamim A. Bayoumi and Peter B. Kenen, \u201cUsing an EC-Wide Monetary Aggregate in Stage Two of EMU, \u201cIMF Working Paper 92/56 (July 1992). The issue of an EC monetary aggregate is far from settled, however, as is indicated by the comment on Kremers and Lane by David Barr, \u201cThe Demand for Money in Europe,\u201d Staff Papers (IMF), Vol. 39 (September 1992), pp. 718\u201329.",

    "text": "The personal \"cloud\" is the first step towards a virtual office | grreporter.info- News from Greece - Breaking News, Business, Sport, Multimedia and Video.\nI often see people carrying large pads with them, their desks are piled with paper and the screen of computer is littered by sticky notes. On the other hand we are all mobile - literally and figuratively speaking \u2013 we are constantly in motion, our work is pursuing us even at home, we have computers from our work, mobile computers (laptop / notebook) we have smartphones, netbooks, tablets ... But we just do not have time to figure out how to make the most use of them!\nI have been planning for a long time to write this article, through which I can show you how using a few free programs we can create a \"virtual office\". Recently, people talk a lot about the so-called \"cloud computing\". I promise it will not rain! Cloud computing enable us only through an Internet connection to use them wherever we are. In this way you will not have to call a colleague and ask him for a number of a client which we have written on a note, but we forgot the desk in the office. The programs that we will use and their application do not fully meet the definition of \"cloud computing\", but with a pure heart, we can say that will make our own, personal cloud.\nWhen we download and install the program, it creates a folder on our computer, in which, whatever we place, is immediately synchronized with another computer where the program is also installed. Files are stored on the server of Dropbox and we can see them on their site, even without having installed on our computer the program, and for this purpose we must create an account. The free version gives us relatively little space of 2 GB, which however is enough for the purposes of this article and our personal cloud through which we will create a virtual office.\nREMEMBER: For the tricks described below, to work, you must install Dropbox on every computer on which you wantto use them! It is mandatory to use the same account / registration / on each computer so as to see the same content that you synchronize.\nI will not describe in detail how to install Dropbox, because they have prepared a wonderful presentation of how to use their service, which you can view at the end of the installation of the program.\nWe have already installed our cloud service and we are ready to synchronize ... what? I will offer you a small but very useful program that I have been using for years and serves me as my calendar, reminder and a list of tasks (To Do). I deliberately write the names in brackets because some of you may have used similar programs and can make a connection with them, as some users use the programs in English, others in Bulgarian. Rainlendar combines all these useful features and has one very big advantage: it can be seen directly on the desktop of your computer, allowing you to always see it in front of your eyes.\nThe program and more about its many useful features, you can find on the website of its author and you can also download it from there: http://www.rainlendar.net/. For many users, the free Lite version will be absolutely enough as well as for the purposes of this article. How to synchronize events and tasks that we input in our small Rainlendar calendar between all computers that we use, let\u2019s say the one at home, in the office and the laptop? Of course, using Dropbox, which we have already installed on each computer and have created our Dropbox user account i.e. username and password.\nIMPORTANT: Save the backup file in a folder of your choice, you may also do it in the folder of Dropbox. Do however mandatorily unzip the file into the folder of Dropbox! Dropbox will automatically synchronize it between all computers on which it is installed.\nYou can rename the extracted file. I've named min \"Internet\", and the downloaded calendar for the purpose of the article I named \"PROBA\". Now we have to ask for the Rainlendar calendar to use the shared calendar. It is very easy, here is how we do it: right click and press \"Options\"",

    "text": "This trip lasted barely two days and it went by very fast. The reason the Abreu Fellows (5 out of the 10 of us) were in Long Beach, California was to perform a number on the TED Stage during the TED Prize session. Here\u2019s a little background.\nTED, which stands for technology, entertainment and design is a non-profit dedicated to promoting \u201cIdeas Worth Spreading.\u201d The organization holds conferences all over the world where they gather some of the best and brightest from all fields to speak for about 18 minutes on their area of expertise. No matter who they are none of the speakers are paid and they all get about 18 minutes. Past speakers have included Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, conductor Benjamin Zander, poet and spoken word artist Rives and of course our own Jose Antonio Abreu, founder of El Sistema.\nThe TED Conference is the main conference and it is held once a year in Long Beach, California. In theory anyone can attend but there is a pretty serious application and a $6000 attendance fee. Despite this the conference sells out very quickly. Founders, CEOs, politicians and celebrities are generally in attendance. Below is a picture of one TED session I attended where they simulcasted the talk of Britain\u2019s next Prime Minister (if all goes as planned), David Cameron.\nSo why the heck were we invited to perform? Well as you all know by now, the founder of El Sistema, Jose Antonio Abreu, won the TED Prize in 2009 and as a result he receieved $100,000 and a wish, which was to launch the Abreu Fellows Program. It is at these yearly TED Conferences that the TED Prize is announced. But before they announce the new TED Prize winner, they look back at previous winners and through speeches, videos and performances they show the audience how the previous winners\u2019 wishes are coming along. To show how Abreu\u2019s wish was developing they invited the Abreu Fellows do a skit/music performance.\nIt was a quick six-minute performance and I think it went really well. We got a standing ovation from the audience and lots of great feedback afterwards. I\u2019d like to think that our performing skills are the reason for the positive reception, but I know it has much more to do with the fact that people believe in Abreu\u2019s wish.\nI\u2019ve spoken to so many people who tell me something special happened last year at the TED Conference when Abreu gave his TED Talk. TEDsters (people who attend TED) are generally brilliant and successful and they\u2019ve seen and done it all, but apparently Abreu\u2019s talk and wish really made an impact on them last year. Fortunately for the Abreu Fellows Program, people are really behind this wish and want to see it unfold.\n9pm: We land at LAX. It\u2019s my first time in California and I\u2019m happy to see palm trees instead of snow.\n11pm: I meet up with my colleague, former school-mate and TED Fellow Robert Gupta for a drink at the hotel.\n11:45pm: I walk around Long Beach looking for food. I see TEDsters everywhere.\n7:30am: I wake-up and head to the Long Beach Performing Arts Center to watch the TED University Talks session. I\u2019m excited to see Gupta speak and perform there.\n8:45am: Gupta\u2019s TED Talk. Have you seen the movie \u201cThe Soloist\u201d starring Jamie Foxx? The protagonist is the real-life Nathaniel Ayers, a musician who develops schizophrenia and becomes homeless. Gupta is now his violin teacher so his TED talk is about his experience working with Ayers. Gupta also performs some Bach after his talk. Out of all the TED University speakers, Gupta is the only one that gets a standing ovation. He deserves it as he is fantastic. His talk should be available online in the next few months. Bravo Robert!\n10:50am: I\u2019m walking to meet the other fellows. From afar I see a beautiful blonde walking towards me by herself. As she gets closer I glance at her nametag. It says Cameron Diaz. She walks right by me and like an idiot, I say nothing, not even hello.\n12:45pm: Rehearsal on the TED stage. The acoustic piano we were supposed to use turns into an electric keyboard. Most of our 30 minute rehearsal time is taken up by the techs trying to get this keyboard to work. Our run-through is mediocre at best so we\u2019d like another go at it. The answer is \u201csorry, but no.\u201d Great\u2026no pressure guys.\n4:00pm: Hair and make-up. No seriously, hair and make-up. The make-up artist tells me I have good skin.\n4:30pm: Meg Ryan walks by us backstage.\n5:00pm: TED Prize session starts. I\u2019m a little nervous but Mark Churchill the director of the Abreu Fellows program is sitting with us in the audience. Seeing a familiar face helps.\n5:45ish pm: Our performance. We kill it. The TED audience is great. I\u2019m relieved it went well. People such as Al Gore, Meg Ryan and Bill Gates are in the audience. Our performance was videotaped by TED and I\u2019ll post it as soon as we get it.\n6:15pm: Jamie Oliver does his TED Talk and announces his wish. Personally I think it\u2019s a great wish: \u201cTo create a strong and sustainable movement to educate every child about food, inspire families to cook again and empower people everywhere to fight obesity.\u201d Check out his TED talk here.\n6:45pm We\u2019re backstage. Sheryl Crow, who has just performed after Jamie Oliver, congratulates us, the fellows, on our performance. I ask myself what I\u2019m doing here.\n7:00pm The fellows and I head to a restaurant for a reception.\n7:15pm We meet various people, all ridiculously good at what they do: a co-founder of Skype, a writer/producer for Grey\u2019s Anatomy, the President of this and CEO of that. I remind myself to take it easy on the drinks so I don\u2019t say something stupid.\n8:00pm As we\u2019re standing around a table, a rather tall, black guy comes right up to me, shakes my hand and congratulates us on our performance. It\u2019s Will Smith. I tell him I\u2019m a big fan. I decline to tell him that I know every line from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He asks what the long, brown thing was that I was playing. He introduces himself to all of us and chats with us for a few minutes. He is very humble and easy-going. As he leaves, I immediately post to Facebook about the encounter. It pains me to admit it now, but I felt giddy, like a 5-year old in a candy store. I again ask myself what I\u2019m doing here.\n11:30pm Block party on the street. I run into a few TEDsters who support the Abreu Fellows program like Carl Haney and Michael Melcher. The band is awesome and people are dancing\u2026as best as a bunch of CEOs and Founders dance.\n7:00am Abreu Fellows Breakfast with TEDsters and supporters of the fellowship. Gupta attends too. I sit beside the President and CEO of Gibson Guitars.\n9:00am I start writing emails to all the people I\u2019ve met to thank them for their support.\nMy TED experience was unbelievable and I feel priveleged to have been invited. Thank you to Rives, who helped us put together our performance, to Amy Novogratz and Anna Verghese who looked after us from the moment we landed at LAX and to everyone in Boston that watched our practice run-throughs and gave us feedback.\nWe depart for Caracas, Venezuela this Thursday where the real adventures will start. El Sistema, I\u2019m constantly told, is the real deal and will not dissappoint. I hope so, because I\u2019ve been bragging about it all year now\u2026You\u2019ll hear from me soon.",

    "text": "I am only one individual American with no special position of government, political or financial power, but I represent a much broader power base that you may not understand or appreciate. While you may be receiving mixed signals from our current leaders, it is critical that you do not underestimate the American people, our commitment to individual liberty and our willingness to back up our convictions with whatever sacrifice is necessary. So, I am glad to have this opportunity to respond to your communication to me and my fellow Americans in your New York Times Op-Ed.\nIt is both ironic and fortuitous that you have chosen to exercise the most sacred right of all Americans, to communicate to us, the God given right to free speech. While we often take this and other critical rights, protecting individual freedom, for granted, it is the first example of why America is an exceptional country. We are exceptional because will fight just as hard for your right to free speech as we will for our own.\nUnlike any other country in the world, America was founded on a set of ideals and laws permanently enshrined in our founding documents; the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States and The Bill of Rights. These laws spell out very clearly that \u201cwe the people\u201d are in charge of our own destiny and they protect us from tyranny, even tyranny from our own government.\nIt is in this spirit of the first Amendment, that I welcome your explanation of your position on Syria, the United Nations, the prospect of America taking a military action against the Syrian government and even your lecture to us about the dangers of promoting American exceptionalism. I welcome this discussion, because in a free society a healthy open debate leads to better decisions and greater progress.\nYou obviously understand and respect the power of free speech, as you adroitly exercised it in your direct communication to the American public. It is a powerful force which is essential to democracy, but which can also be manipulated by the political masters of Machiavellian deception. Perhaps you can demonstrate your good intentions by having the courage and courtesy to extend my response to you, directly to the Russian public.\nAs you have witnessed, by the reaction of the American people to the prospect of another military intervention in the Middle East, Americans by nature are a peace loving people. But, please don\u2019t make the mistake of interpreting our resistance to a poorly thought out plan, being promoted by our political leaders, as any indication of a lack of willingness to make whatever sacrifices that are necessary to protect against clear and present threats to the security interests of the United States and its allies.\nYou make a lot of very good points about why America should not make a military strike against Syria. Many of us, like you, do not believe that it makes sense for America to intervene in a foreign civil war where there are no clear objectives and where there is no clear and direct threat to the security interests of the US. It is not our role to be the policeman of the world, or to punish all the bad actors. However, it is our role to defend freedom and democracy whenever and wherever we can, without forcing it on people who are not ready for it, don\u2019t understand it and don\u2019t want it.\nWhile our elected political leaders have not provided you, us or the many countries comprising the Mid-East region with a clear and unambiguous position, let me be very clear about the commitment of the American people. We will defend Israel as if it were Alaska. Any threats to Israel by Iran or any other country will be considered a direct threat to us and will be met with the full force and will of the American people.\nThere are many ways to advance the cause of freedom and military action should be a last consideration. We must be very careful with when and how we exercise the great power that we have. We prefer the Theodore Roosevelt foreign policy of \u201ctalk softly and carry a big stick\u201d. In the meantime, we are committed to the policy of peace through strength, and we fully support building our military strength.\nAs the leader of the free world, America has an exceptional responsibility to protect and to advance the cause of individual freedom throughout the world. We remain the best hope in the world for the survival of individual freedom. We are an exceptional country not just because we are free but because we have demonstrated time after time over history, our willingness to sacrifice our own lives so that others throughout the world can enjoy the same freedoms that have made America a great country.\nYou make a good point about how America and Russia were once allies before we became cold war enemies. We need only to look at the historical relationship between the U.S. and Germany and the U.S. and Japan to recognize the immense potential of a positive relationship developing between Russia and America. It did not take very long for the bitterness of WWII\u2019s arch enemies to give way to the rewards, success and friendship of free and open societies. The Marshall plan is a great example of how we might approach solving some of the great problems facing our world today, like a fair and peaceful solution to the Mid-East conflict. The evidence is overwhelming. Russia and the U.S. could be partners in progress. We have much more to unite us than we have to divide us. We face the same terrorist threats and the same concerns over nuclear proliferation. We have the same desire to advance our citizens with respect to their health, education and economic success. We all want to raise our families in peace and prosperity.\nWe also appreciate the founding purpose of the United Nations, but we have legitimate reasons to be skeptical of it, not the least of which, is the lack of its effectiveness, its socialistic leanings and the historical lack of cooperation between the U.S and Russia. It comes down to an issue of trust, and freedom, which goes to the heart of the American soul. We are fierce individualists. We believe that the power of government rests with the individual citizens who have a responsibility to exercise control over their government. The government is there to serve us, not to control us. Every time we, as individuals, give up power and personal responsibility to government entities we give up our individual liberties. The further away (local, state, national, and international) the governmental entity is, the worse the outcome and the harder it is to get the power back. Every time we give up our individual liberties we reduce progress for all humans.\nWe have had our own taste of socialism over the last few years under the leadership of President Obama, and it is a bitter and disappointing experience. Many of us view the United Nations as just another large bureaucratic, ineffective and unaccountable organization diluting the power of the American citizen and promoting anti-American sentiment throughout the world.\nSpeaking of accountability, America faces much larger challenges than Syria. Today, America is involved in a gigantic struggle for its own soul and its future. Will we embrace the concepts of maximum individual freedom, responsibility, independence and privacy like our founders envisioned or will we allow huge unaccountable bureaucracies to take our freedoms from us? Will we succumb to the bribery of low information voters with government handouts and the corruption of giant special interest lobbyists or will we stand up for truth and justice and our belief in self reliance and capitalism which are the core principles on which this great country was built?\nUnfortunately our current President seems to agree with you about American Exceptionalism. He apologizes to the world for an America he should be proud of. Oh, he says the right words to us, but he acts just the opposite. He promises boldly what he knows he can\u2019t deliver. He hides the truth and he supports the people who work for him, who lie in front of Congressional hearings. He does not respect the will of the American people and he disrespects the institutions that have been set up to protect us. He spends our grandchildren\u2019s money with no sense of responsibility nor does he have any inkling of the horrendous impending consequences for America of his bad leadership. He attacks our energy independence, capitalism, free enterprise and the institutions that have made America great. He successfully divides America when he could easily be uniting it. Instead of celebrating the progress we have made on racial equality, he sows the seeds of discontent. He forces really bad laws (like Obamacare) on the public against their will. He is aided and abetted by a free press that has forgot and/or ignored their critical responsibilities to protect our democracy by demanding the truth wherever it leads. We have lost more freedoms to our internal enemies over the last five years than we have lost to our external enemies over the last 50 years.\nSo Mr. Putin, you see that we have a lot bigger problems that America needs to address instead of creating a new one by invading Syria. Fortunately, we are an exceptional country and the forces of freedom and responsibility will soon emerge with an even greater conviction to reestablish the rule of the people over our government. We are an exceptional country because we are protected by a Constitution and a Bill of Rights and a Declaration of Independence that very specifically limit the power of the federal government in favor of the individual and the States. We are an exceptional country because we recognize that our freedoms were given to us by our Creator and no government, religious organization or corporate bureaucracy has any right to take any of our freedoms away from us. Not even Prince Machiavelli himself. Be assured that we will put our own house in order and be the world leader that speaks clearly and unambiguously.\nSo please, don\u2019t let the America you see today give you a false impression of weakness or lack of conviction. We are not happy with what has happened to America over the last five years. Democracy is imperfect and sometimes we vote with our hearts and not our heads. But America always gets it right in the long run and there is nothing more powerful than a united free people that finally figures out that they have been misled.\nSo now, President Putin, it\u2019s time to, as we say in America, to \u201cput your money where your mouth is\u201d. The real world issues are nuclear proliferation, Iran, world-wide terrorism sponsored by Islamic terrorists, and world economic success. We need Russia to come together with America and guarantee that Iran will not get nuclear capability and that those countries that already have it will not allow it to be provided to others. Nuclear catastrophe remains the biggest threat to the world and you, President Putin, could become a world-wide hero by joining America and other peace loving countries to lead a grand plan to reduce the nuclear threat to humanity. I can only speak as an individual, but I believe a world wide effort led by Russia and America, starting with Iran, would be welcome by the American people. It is certainly a much better idea than spending trillions of dollars on future wars that will surely come if we don\u2019t take aggressive action to solve this problem now. In the spirit of capitalism Russia and its people could benefit greatly by joining America as partners in peace. Given what happened to Japan and Germany, it\u2019s really not that great of a leap to envision Russia and America coming together in peace and prosperity.\nFinally, there may be a language misunderstanding with respect to \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d We agree with you that as individuals we are all equal in the eyes of the Lord. None of us by nature are superior to the rest of us. We want the same things for our families as the people of any other country; security and the right to \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d. These are natural rights of all humans and we have a responsibility to help all humans secure these rights. But this is not to be confused with socialism or communism which the vast majority of Americans do not believe in. While we believe in equal opportunity we do not believe in equal outcome. Every individual has the right to distinguish themselves (to become exceptional) through, hard work, education, perseverance, risk taking, individual choices and yes even luck. We believe in private property, capitalism, self-reliance and individual achievement and we encourage exceptionalism. Whether it\u2019s academics, sports, business, music or community service, or our service to our country, we encourage and honor exceptionalism.\nIt is not dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional. It is only dangerous if they don\u2019t earn it or deserve it. It\u2019s like the Olympics. Every four years we get together to see, who the most exceptional athletes in the world compete. And every time we are amazed at how exceptional these athletes are. They are exceptional because they are talented, train hard and exercise discipline. This is a good thing to encourage and they deserve their gold metals, not to have them redistributed to those that were not exceptional. We do not encourage people to think of themselves as exceptional, because of their color or their political status, their connections or their ethnicity. To consider them exceptional they have to earn it.\nAmerica is exceptional for very different reasons. America is much more than a physical space with great natural resources. America is much more than a nation state with an exceptional history of fighting for the freedom of other nations thousands of miles away. America is an idea of individual liberty and personal responsibility that can help people throughout the world. America is a way of life, and a belief in the sovereignty of the individual. America is philosophy that is enshrined in our founding documents. America is exceptional because it is the best hope for freedom for the rest of the world. We are proud and exceptionally lucky to be Americans. We understand that our freedom is dependent on our ability to recognize and fulfill our responsibilities as individuals and as a country. We also understand that individual freedom can only be sustained to the degree that we exercise an equal level of responsibility as individuals and as a country.\nJust as you say that \u201cwe must not forget that God created us equal\u201d we must also remember that God gave to us as individuals the right to self-determination and there is no doubt that God did that with the expectation that we would use that right to become better human beings- perhaps even exceptional ones.\nThis entry was posted in Blog on December 20, 2013 by thomaswreed.",

    "text": "The use of certain common medications could delay the recovery of patients with a brain or spinal cord injury, says a research team at the University of East Anglia and other universities in the United Kingdom. The findings were published on August 9, 2015, in the journal Brain Injury.\nResearchers examined medications with anticholinergic properties which are prescribed to up to one-half of older adults for conditions such as depression, insomnia, and bladder problems. Antocholinergics are known to have side effects such as dizziness, confusion, and temporary cognitive impairment, but researchers say this study was the first to look at the effects of antocholinergics on people with pre-existing brain and spinal injuries. Clinicians in neuro-rehabilitation units often prescribe medications with anti-cholinergic properties for a variety of symptoms from pain to urinary incontinence.\nResearchers studied 52 patients who had acquired brain or spinal cord injuries at a neuro-rehabilitation unit. Patients who had higher levels of anticholinergic medications in their bodies had a longer average hospital stays.\nThe state of having higher levels of anticholinergic drugs in a body is known as the anticholinergic drug burden, or ACB. A higher ACB score in patients on discharge, when compared to levels on admission, were associated with longer hospital stays and patients with lower ACB scores had shorter hospital stays on average. The team cautioned, however, that the research was an observational study, which means that they cannot imply a cause-and-effect relationship between hospital stays and ACB scores.\nSpinal Stenosis: PT or Surgery?",

    "text": "Can prednisone cause blurred vision and numbness in feet?\nBeen on 20ng per day prednisone for PMR for 5 months. Toes have started going numb and vision blurring. Can these be side affects of prednisone? When finally get weaned off prednisone, will these problems go away?\nThe only side effect that I got out of prednisone was getting very close to osteoporosis which my rheumatologist fixed with an injection twice a year of Prolia which is a bone reconstructive agent.\nI was taking 55mgs of prednisone and 6 months had passed when I got bronchitis and asthma. I was hospitalized and I had a big pain on my side which I thought was because of the coughing. The doctor said it was 3 fractured ribs and they called my rheumatologist and she ordered a bone scan with urgency and it was the prednisone. Five years have passed and now I am taking 5mgs of prednisone daily. Ribs healed but I have been getting better with acupuncture for preventing stress. Stress aggravates polymyalgia.This was informed to me by Dr Ayala. He is my acupuncturist and he is a doctor MD too. Try to be calm and relaxed. I used to take tramadol too but now I don't.\nThe only thing I cannot leave is the prednisone. As soon as I try to quit I go into bad pain and immobility again so I keep up with it and take the injection. I did gain a lot of weight but I don't care about it anymore. I can move and I can do my things without help and I love that ;so who cares I am fat. On my first year with this illness I was almost an invalid. Had to cut my hair because I could not raise my arms very well to comb myself. My husband did not know how to do anything with my long hair. There is hope, do not despair. Looks bad in the beginning but you get better with time. The blurred vision and the numbness on your feet could be diabetes. Check with your doctor. My rheumatologist told me to go on a diet as soon as I started prednisone, she said that it can raise your sugar and cause diabetes if you don't eat well. I know my sugar went up in the coming years but still not enough to be diabetic.\nI had blurry vision and a good deal of swelling to the face which included the eyes. I had neuropathy in my feet only. I asked to switch to methylprednisolone and everything changed for me. I have been on steroids for 4 1/2 years and am finally down to 0.5 mg. The trip down was tedious.\nFinally almost there. I hope this helps you. I know, it\u2019s tough. Best of luck.\nI have been diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica & am about to start taking Methotrexate(MTT)?\nWill I ever get off Prednisone?\nPolymyalgia Rheumatica - Does anyone have swollen sore hands as a side effect to taking Prednisone?\nPolymyalgia Rheumatica - is prednisone the only drug of choice for this condition?\nPolymyalgia Rheumatica - Prednisone and CBD oil: I have been diagnosed with PMR and have been on?",

    "text": "Erin Baldassari, writing for the Mercury News, reports that Jonathan Bernbaum was 34 when he died in the Ghost Ship fire. Jonathan\u2019s father, Ed, is trying to do his part to answer the need for spaces for artists by starting an ambitious effort with neighbor Beth Jay and architect Tom Dolan. The nonprofit, named Vital Arts, will raise funds from the Bay Area\u2019s tech sector to support safe living/work spaces for artists in Oakland\u2014because, after all, it is largely the tech sector that has driven rents up so high that most local artists can no longer afford them.\nThe money will be used to purchase buildings for living and working in or provide safety enhancements to landlords that agree to maintain buildings as rental spaces for low- and moderate-income artists.\nThe wildly innovative and resourceful San Francisco-based Community Arts Stabilization Trust (CAST), which NPQ has previously covered, will act as a fiscal sponsor for Vital Arts. CAST has a remarkable track record in helping to retain and create arts facilities in combination with local established arts nonprofits but some of the groups in Oakland are a newish proposition.\nCAST recently began working with the city of Oakland to develop a program to provide technical and financial assistance for arts and cultural organizations. Many of those organizations are informal art collectives that often operate as de facto nonprofits, Levin said, prompting CAST to become increasingly focused on supporting these sometimes amorphous groups.\nThere is no doubt that live/work spaces have been endangered since the fire. One collective of artists and performers, known as the Castle von Trapp, will imminently lose its West Oakland compound after the cost and logistical challenges of making a bid on the property proved too challenging for the collective. Still, the collective plans to move forward together.\nEventually, Dolan envisions a network of collectives that can share resources and knowledge, beginning in Oakland and spreading across the bay to San Francisco with Vital Arts ultimately serving as a model for collectives across the country.\nSince 1969, the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia has provided a home for groundbreaking artists of every stripe. But can it remain relevant in the city\u2019s arts scene without a building to its name?",

    "text": "Humanities teacher Micah Weiss believes in the power of respectful, open debate, and he\u2019s fostering a spirit of lively discussion in his classroom.\nHumanities teacher Micah Weiss wears many hats here at Oliverian. While he\u2019s an English teacher by training, his American Studies classes at Oli focus on a holistic blend of American history and literature before, during, and after World War II. He\u2019s also the chairman of the hiring committee, serves on the Oliverian Senior Project committee, and lives on campus with his wife, Betsy, and their three children.\nThis semester, Micah used Oli\u2019s electives week to explore a particularly timely topic with his students: how to engage in productive civil discourse. We caught up with Micah to discuss his approach to the class, the students\u2019 response, and what he learned along the way.\nQ: What are some of the unique opportunities that Oli\u2019s electives week offers?\nA: As a teacher, having a three-and-a-half hour block of class time to work with is really interesting. You can do a lot with that. I did a film noir class last year, and before that, I used to lead a class that centered around a big World War II-themed board game that takes 17 hours to play. But for this year\u2019s class, I was trying to get past some of the political polarization that we\u2019re seeing around us and help the students listen to each other.\nQ: Can you tell us a little bit about the class you taught?\nA: I taught a class called \u201cThe Great Debates.\u201d As the class went on, my original plan for the class changed based on the students and how engaged they became. At first, I had intended for it to be a class about watching and analyzing intellectual debates, because there are a lot of long form, debates between public intellectuals that you can watch for free.\nBut once we got started, the students themselves were so excited about the ideas and controversies that we were talking about that I shifted the class to focus more on their voices. They engaged in debates about whatever they wanted to talk about, and I acted as a moderator and tried to get everyone to listen to each other without the conversation becoming too polarized.\nQ: What did your students think of the class?\nA: I was very lucky to have a group of kids that were willing to talk and had a diverse set of opinions on different topics. At first, we were looking at logical fallacies and how to make good arguments versus bad arguments. But by the end of the week, we were discussing major issues and trying to come to a consensus \u2014 or at least disagree respectfully.\nFor example, our conversation about gun control was really interesting, because we had a couple of students from rural New York, where hunting and target shooting are a way of life. On the other end of the spectrum, we had a student from an urban environment who\u2019s very passionately against any kind of legalized guns, and a student from Europe who wanted weapon control of all kinds. We had this wide array of views, but we had a really constructive and respectful discussion about it. It was great to give the students a chance to see that you can disagree with each other and not hate each other at the same time.\nQ: Did you have any \u201caha!\u201d moments where you felt like students were really learning to engage in this type of respectful dialogue?\nA: I think the most constructive conversation we all had was the one around what racism is, who gets to decide what the definition is, and under what circumstances. So, you know, there\u2019s the newer, left-wing definition of \u201cbigotry plus power, equals racism.\u201d There\u2019s also the traditional definition in dictionaries, which is racial bigotry. So how has that changed, and how does that change the way we talk to each other about race in America?\nAt the very beginning of that conversation, it was very heated and very intense. There was a very quick jump to accusation. By the end, there was a much deeper understanding between the entire group that this is a very complicated issue and that words can change meaning over time, and that we have to listen to each other before we make accusations. By the end of that conversation, they were really listening to each other. It was beautiful.\nQ: What do you think makes Oliverian unique?\nA: I think that because we\u2019re small and because our community is so immersive, we can eat dinner with students, or take them on long trips, or take them to the movies or Harvard Model Congress, or have an electives week where we go people-watch and write stories about the people we watch. This is real time that we\u2019re spending together, these are real relationships that we\u2019re building.\nIn my old job as a teacher in the Bronx, I would get my kids for one 45 minute class a day and maybe lunch for half an hour. At the end of the week, I\u2019d go home and there was nothing I could do. Anything they were getting out of our relationship was really transitory. Here, I really get to create relationships with these kids that are meaningful and long-lasting.",

    "text": "Aims.Deflagration models poorly explain the observed diversity of SNIa. Current multidimensional simulations of SNIa predict a significant amount of, so far unobserved, carbon and oxygen moving at low velocities. It has been proposed that these drawbacks can be resolved if there is a sudden jump to a detonation (delayed detonation), but these kinds of models have been explored mainly in one dimension. Here we present new three-dimensional delayed detonation models in which the deflagraton-to-detonation transition (DDT) takes place in conditions like those favored by one-dimensional models.\nMethods.We have used a smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics code adapted to follow all the dynamical phases of the explosion, with algorithms devised to handle subsonic as well as supersonic combustion fronts. The starting point was a centrally ignited C\u2013O white dwarf of 1.38 . When the average density on the flame surface reached ~2-3 107 g cm-3 a detonation was launched.\nResults.The detonation wave processed more than 0.3 of carbon and oxygen, emptying the central regions of the ejecta of unburned fuel and raising its kinetic energy close to the fiducial 1051 erg expected from a healthy type Ia supernova. The final amount of 56Ni synthesized also was in the correct range. However, the mass of carbon and oxygen ejected is still too high.\nConclusions.The three-dimensional delayed detonation models explored here show an improvement over pure deflagration models, but they still fail to coincide with basic observational constraints. However, there are many aspects of the model that are still poorly known (geometry of flame ignition, mechanism of DDT, properties of detonation waves traversing a mixture of fuel and ashes). Therefore, it will be worth pursuing its exploration to see if a good SNIa model based on the three-dimensional delayed detonation scenario can be obtained.",

    "text": "Most Australians receive a tax refund, but not all spend it wisely. Here\u2019s how to make the most of your tax windfall \u2013 and not blow it all in Bali.\nDoesn\u2019t tax time come around fast?\nIt doesn\u2019t feel that long ago since last financial year\u2019s tax return was done and dusted, and now the next deadline (October 31 if you lodge your own tax return) is in sight again.\nBut hey, let\u2019s stay upbeat about it!\nAfter all, eight in 10 Australians get a tax refund according to the ATO , with an average of $2,574 being handed out per person.\nSo it\u2019s important you have a plan for that money.\nSensibly, and perhaps a little surprisingly, only one-in-ten Australians go large and either spend their tax refund on holidays or big purchases.\nThe rest of us? Well, we tend to put it to pretty good use.\nAlmost 30% of Aussies use their tax refund to pay outstanding bills or fines.\nAfter bills, one-in-five put it towards savings, one-in-eight pay off loans or credit cards, and one-in-ten put it towards their home loan.\nBut there are effective ways to do these things, and not-so-effective ways, as we\u2019ll discuss below.\nIf you use your refund to pay off a high-interest debt, you could save money over the long run and may become debt-free sooner.\nHave a look at your debts and see which has the highest interest rate \u2013 whether it be your credit card, your mortgage, or a personal loan \u2013 and consider paying that off first.\nPutting your money into a high-interest savings account can make your refund go further.\nIf each year you put that average $2,574 tax return into a high interest savings account with a rate of 5%, in just five years you\u2019ll have $17,508 \u2013 that\u2019s almost an extra $5,000 in compounding interest.\nNot bad for minimal effort.\nThe government estimates that the lump sum needed to support a comfortable lifestyle for a couple entering retirement is $640,000 (or $545,000 for a single person) in today\u2019s money.\nThe beauty of compounding interest means that if you allocate an annual tax return of $2,000 towards your super portfolio each year for the next 25 years you\u2019ll be $102,000 better off in retirement (assuming an interest rate of 5%).\nAn offset account is a regular transactional account linked to your home loan. Its major benefit is that you only pay interest on the difference between the money in the account and your mortgage.\nThe idea is that \u2013 under the right circumstances \u2013 the money that you save from paying off the interest on your mortgage can outweigh the money you\u2019d earn from a savings account. It could also help you become mortgage-free sooner.\nThe best bit? Money in your offset account is still available for you to use.\n5. Still want to treat yourself?\nIf you can\u2019t resist buying a new computer or tablet, make sure it\u2019s related to your work.\nIf you purchase a work-related item worth more than $300 you might be able to claim it as a deduction in next year\u2019s tax return. Just be sure to double check you can claim it first.\nAnd hey, if you remain unconvinced and still want to go on that overseas beach holiday, who are we to try and stop you? You\u2019ve no doubt earned it!\nWe all look forward to getting a juicy tax refund. But if you\u2019re not sure what you should do with yours, come in and have a chat.\nWe can help devise a strategy tailored to your individual circumstances to ensure you get the most out of this year\u2019s tax refund.",

Was the success scheme-related, or did an individual player stand out?\nRashaad Penny finally flashed the play-making abilities that made him a first-round pick.\nIn this video breakdown, I tracked and analyzed each of his 74 carries so far on the year.\nRussell Wilson missed big opportunities, took unnecessary sacks and threw a pick-six, but somehow kept the Seahawks close versus the Chargers.\nRussell Wilson's statistically perfect effort versus the Lions didn't start out that way.\nFrank Clark is off to a great start in 2018, and the Seahawks need to re-sign him before he hits free agency.\nWhile many saw him as a top tier slot cornerback, there were some doubts on whether or not he could play outside.\nLast week versus the Raiders, the Seahawks scored their first opening-drive touchdown in 34 games. Credit offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's play-calling for the breakthrough.\nIn his first start, Tedric Thompson did a good job recognizing route combinations and calling out multiple plays before the snap, putting the Seahawks defense in position to succeed.\nJosh Rosen made his first NFL start on Sunday when the Cardinals hosted the Seahawks, and while nothing jumps off the page statistically, his numbers are misleading.\nIn Week 3, Chris Carson gained almost half of his 102 rushing yards independent of his offensive line's contribution. With Carson injured, Mike Davis more than matched that feat in Week 4.\nChristian McCaffrey is a runner, receiver and as a pass blocker in Carolina's offense, employing his elusiveness, patience, and vision to make plays.\nChris Carson was the first Seahawks running back to notch a 100-yard game in nearly two years. He's making the most of his opportunities and proving he deserves to be Seattle's lead back.\nBaker Mayfield consistently took advantage of the defensive matchups in exactly the ways Tyrod Taylor couldn't versus the Jets.\nPatrick Mahomes was considered by some to be the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in the 2017 draft, but his development is already proving his doubters wrong.\nRussell Wilson was responsible for half of the six sacks he took in Week 1 versus the Broncos. How many were his fault Monday night in Chicago?\nLooking for someone to blame for Seattle's poor performance on third down versus Denver? Start with the Seahawks' franchise quarterback.\nRookie tight end Will Dissly was a bright spot in Seattle's Week 1 loss at Denver, proving he can be a factor in the Seahawks' passing game in addition to his blocking duties.\nJulio Jones is such an incredibly talented route runner that he'll continue to perform well regardless who calls the plays.\nNew Seahawks quarterback Brett Hundley exhibits many of the same issues he had coming out of college despite three years in Green Bay.\nIn his sophomore season, Allen's budding talent will open eyes around the league.\nThe former Florida State star flashed the potential that convinced the Chargers to take him with the 17th overall pick.\nIn an ideal world, Seahawks rookie linebacker Shaquem Griffin could sit behind K.J. Wright for his entire first NFL season, but the fifth-round pick will be called upon to star sooner than later.\nBrian Schottenheimer has preached a \"back to basics\" message for Russell Wilson since being hired as offensive coordinator. In Seattle's the third preseason game, this focus on fundamentals paid off.\nUndrafted rookie Poona Ford is making the most of his limited opportunities. While he\u2019s mainly lining up against backup offensive lineman, he has shown enough upside to warrant a roster spot.\nAnalyzing the route combination he used against the Steelers' Cover 1 defense and how he used his strength and length to grab the score.\nThe Seahawks selected Rasheem Green to boost their pass rush after losing veterans Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett in the offseason. So far, the rookie has shown a lot of promise.\nThe forgotten man in Seattle's tight-end group this offseason, Nick Vannett flashed a lot of potential in the Seahawks\u2019 first preseason game.\nSaquon Barkley paired vision and patience to exploit the Browns' defense in his first NFL carry.\nJ.R. Sweezy played in only 14 games over the past two seasons in Tampa Bay, but his pass-blocking skills could earn him a starting job in his return to Seattle, provided he stays healthy.\nThe stats from Lamar Jackson's NFL debut weren't pretty, but he made some quality plays that should give Ravens fans hope for the future.\nDespite consistent production, Doug Baldwin is still one of the most underrated receivers in the NFL. That could change this year.\nSeahawks Film Room: Is McDougald better at free safety or strong safety?\nBradley McDougald displayed his versatility while filling in at both starting safety spots for the Seahawks last season, but which position is a better fit for his skills?\nUnder new offensive line coach Mike Solari, Seattle seems likely to feature more plays using down blocks, combination blocks and pulling offensive lineman, like \"60/70 Power.\"\nSeahawks Film Room: Is it time to re-sign Tyler Lockett?\nTyler Lockett is an elite return specialist, but he's still developing as a receiver. That presents the Seahawks with an interesting conundrum as he enters the final year of his rookie contract.\nKam Chancellor, who announced he was walking away from football after suffering a career-ending neck injury last year, impacted games in subtle and not-so-subtle ways for the Seahawks.\nThere weren't a lot of positives coming out of the Seahawks 2017 run game, but Chris Carson showed enough \u2013 in an admittedly small sample size \u2013 to compete for a starting job in 2018.\nKeenan Allen exceed all expectations in 2017 after returning from at torn ACL. Sam Gold breaks down how Allen used his superior route running and hip flexibility to create separation.\nDoes offensive line contribution affect running back contribution? Samuel Gold hopes to answer that question in the second part his of analysis on running back and offensive line performance.\nMost metrics do a relatively poor job of separating offensive line and running back performance on run plays. When comparing two of this year's first-round backs, Samuel Gold attempts to do just that.\nIt\u2019s clear Brandon Marshall isn\u2019t the same player he used to be, but the six-time Pro Bowler can play a valuable role in the Seahawks\u2019 offense.\nFourth-round tight end Will Dissly will be an instant upgrade for the Seahawks\u2019 offense and exemplifies Pete Carroll's \"always compete\" mentality.\nIn his first piece for The Athletic, Sam Gold breaks down third-round defensive end Rasheem Green's college film and tells us why he believes Green can be an impact player for the Seahawks.",

Side question, is there a way to disable that?\nI removed the RHGB and quiet options in the kernel line of grub2, as we are running Fedora Server 27, and it takes about 20 minutes for each reboot to start showing the kernel boot logs. I changed the Embedded SATA setting from AHCI to RAID. Once the kernel kicks in boot time is less than a minute. I got a suggestion to run modprobe on either the driver for the hard drive or H310. Dell's downloads page has a driver for the H310 but only for Red Hat. Is the Embedded SATA setting incorrect? Do I try the mod probe route?\nCan you private message me your service tag so I can get some additional information?\nWe replied to you on Twitter.\nI sent a PM on Twitter. So for now, when I go to the RAID configuration, what drop downs should I select to get better performance?\nWill a H710 or H710P fit and not require a reinstall?\nYou can replace the H310 with an H710 or H710P and it will import the virtual disk without a reinstall. RAID 1 or 10, should provide better performance on the H310, but that would require a reinstall.\nWhen in the config for the RAID can you tell me the optimal drop downs I should choose for gaining some read/write performance?\nFor the H310 the options are more limited and not anything that will dramatically effect performance. Switching controllers is the best option.\nI see in the Advanced Options of the controller BIOS is grayed out and Read Policy is set to No Read Ahead and Write Policy is set to Write Through. Is there a way to edit this or did that need to happen when I initialized the disks and created the array?\nThose features require an H710. The H310 doesn\u2019t have cache on the controller to use them.\nWe replaced the controller with a h710 but now the BIOS does not pick it up and error with no boot disk found. Lifecycle controller is set to automatically detect new hardware. Anything else to check?\nWhat does it show in ctrl+r under pd mgmt?",

That's just a given.\n\"Fluoride batteries can have a higher energy density, which means that they may last longer \u2013 up to eight times longer than batteries in use today,\" says Caltech researcher Robert Grubbs, famous for winning a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005.\nThe type of electrochemical technology supplying power to your smart devices makes use of positively charged lithium 'Li2+' cations as a kind of chemical 'piston' to draw an electrical charge through a circuit.\nAt full charge, a supply of cations occupy the battery's anode. Once the circuit is closed, ions surge into the cathode, producing a current that does the all-important work. To reset the cell, all that's required is a voltage to 'push' the lithium piston back again.\n\"For a battery that lasts longer, you need to move a greater number of charges,\" says Simon Jones, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\"Moving multiply-charged metal cations is difficult, but a similar result can be achieved by moving several singly-charged anions, which travel with comparative ease.\"\n\"But fluoride can be challenging to work with, in particular because it's so corrosive and reactive,\" says Grubbs.\nThis isn't to say nobody has successfully made a functional fluoride ion battery. But the ions are part of a solid structure, which as you can imagine doesn't let them slip around too easily. Not at room temperature at least.\nOn finding the solvent did a fairly suitable job of allowing fluoride's anions to shuffle between electrodes at room temperature, the team ran models to find ways to tweak its performance with additives.\n\"We are still in the early stages of development, but this is the first rechargeable fluoride battery that works at room temperature,\" says Jones.\nSo, we might need to wait a bit longer for weekly phone recharges, but this is an exciting step - an we can hardly wait for this exciting technology to come into the market.",

    "text": "Why is the Coptic Pope based in Cairo and not Alexandria?\nShouldn't the Coptic Pope be based in Alexandria, seeing as we call the His Holiness the Pope of \"Alexandria\"? And the Coptic Church is called the Church of \"Alexandria\"? I know there exists the Historical Cathedral of St. Mark in Alexandria but why is the Pope based in the Cathedral in Cairo?\nWhy and when did this change occur?\nThe change as made when Cairo became the capital of Egypt. As for when was it done, i'll leave that to someone else to find.\nCairo was built in second half of the 10th century, by the Fatimite Khalif El-Muez LeDin Allah (later baptized in the monastery of Abu Seifen after the Mukatam miracle).\nIt was built in place of existing \"cities\" like El-Fustat and El-Kata'3, which were more of camping sites of the islamic armies and the residence place of the arab rulers, and had been the center of political power since the arab invasion.\nCairo became the capital of the Fatimite State in North Africa and the Levant and as such of increasing political importance, which led the 70th Pope Gabriel II (known as Ibn Turek) to officially annex Cairo to Alexandria under his jurisdiction in his papacy (1131 -1145 a.d.). Pope Gabriel II annexed Cairo after the death of her Bishop, Youaness Ibn Senhout.\nThere are indications that Pope Gabriel II was not the first Pope to try to move to Cairo, but he was the first successful Pope in his attempt.\nThe residence of all subsequent Popes has been a church in Cairo.\nInterestingly enough, the famous theologian and Bishop Boulous El-Boushy in the 13th century, is sometimes referred to as Bishop of Cairo (Egypt) or Babylon (the ancient fortress near Cairo). It is not known whether Babylon was considered outside the geographic limits of diocese of Cairo, but is not likely. It is equally unlikely that Pope Kyrillos III would give up any territory to another bishop, even if it his close friend.\nThe same is with patriarch of Serbia.\nIn middle ages his see was town of Pec but when the Turks invaded Serbia after several centuries the see was moved. And that happend two times.\nNow Serbian patriarch in his title has that he is archbishop of Pec, but he resides 500km north, in Belgrade.\nSeveral dioceses of Serbian church also in their name has one see, but bishop resides in another.\nI believe the Pope is stretched too thin. Covering Cairo, Alexandria, all the areas in the States without a diocesan Bishop seems to be too much. It would seem very difficult if not impossible to provide effective oversight with such a wide span of control.\nBut the pope is not alone. In the US, he has a patriarchal exarch for North America through Bishop David, a patriarchal exarch for the Eritreans in the US through Bishop Macarius, a suffragan diocese of Virgina through Bishop Michael, and 2 diocese with their respective bishops. He also has general bishops doing work in the US.\nIn Cairo, there are 12 general bishops who are either suffragan bishops or assistants to the patriarchal throne in Cairo. He also has a patriarchal vicar in Cairo through Hegumen Sergios Sergios.\n\"Stretched too thin\" is a very subjective quality. What exactly is too thin? Are 5 bishops in the US not enough that Pope Tawadros is doing the work himself? Praise God who sent us a shepherd with such vigor and enthusiasm and heart. May God give our pope the strength to do His will always, regardless of where the pope resides.\nComplex issues and decisions have still required the involvement of the Pope in some of the areas that you mention that are technically in the Pope's diocese but overseen by bishops.\nSometimes the bishops may even defer the issue entirely to the Pope and ask the church in question to take the issue up with the Pope directly. In the meantime the bishops may avoid visiting or contacting the church in question to avoid getting involved in a situation they feel should only be addressed by the Pope.\nHere is where situations can deteriorate. By the time a church is able to actually contact and communicate with the Pope, months if not years usually pass and situations can spiral out of control. A simple issue that could have been resolved with early intervention can be disastrous if left to fester. And this has happened more than once.\nHG Bishop Youssef and I believe HG Bishop Serapion visit each church in their diocese at least twice a year if not more and are in constant contact with priests and congregation. They are able to keep tabs on the churches in their diocese. They also have the authority to address issues and make decisions complex or otherwise. I am not so sure the churches in the areas you mention benefit from the same type of regular oversight and ability to sucessfully resolve problems swiftly.\nHH Pope Tawadros has shown wisdom in his managerial style and I am confident he will structure church leadership in a way that is most effective - not necessarily the way it was in the past. Just as HH Pope Shenouda showed wisdom in assigning diocesan bishops such as Bishop Serapion and Bishop Youssef, I am sure HH Pope Tawadros will continue to structure leadership effectively.\nI think people's issue is that these bishops are all general bishops, and so the Pope is the ultimate diocesan bishop. Since these general bishops cannot ordain their own priests and thus have their authority derived from the Pope, this effectively gives the Pope control over them, giving him control of the Holy Synod (he can count on the votes of the general bishops under his control), and thus moving towards a Roman Catholic monarchal model of the papacy. In ancient times, the bishop of Alexandria was first among equals in Egypt, and still only had one vote in the Synod. Now he effectively has the votes of 30 general bishops plus himself.\nNote: this is not personal, I am not saying that Pope Tawadros, or any other previous popes were wrong, I'm just saying that the principle is wrong.\nYou are right, but it is clear that this will be the hierarchy model for the foreseen future of the Coptic Church.\ni have to ask...what would those 'votes' of the general bishops count towards?! ya3ny isn't each of them STILL have their own voice and authority as a bishop in the holy synod. if each diocese only have one bishop vote int he Holy Synod....what about the dioceses that are being broken up more and more through the years as the congregation increases.....is that 'vote' broken up into little parts to?!\nTheoretically the general bishops have their own vote of course, but realistically and practically they are not going to go against the Pope, as he is their boss (you do what your boss tells you). It is unheard of until now for a bishop to have a boss.\nI don't get the second part of your statement. If dioceses are being broken up, it means that more diocesan bishops are being ordained, and I can see no reason why a full diocesan bishop shouldn't have a vote.\nso it's not that a bishop has a vote, it's a diocese bishop.....kool!!!\nActually, in regards to the magisterial model of the Catholic church, I actually heard Metropolitan Pachomious actually say that our church legislation was governed by the magesterium! I was extremely upset that because of the model of leadership which we have experienced, even the teaching of the church fathers has changed to a western ideology.\nI see exactly what you are saying but I think it will be different with HH Pope Tawadros. You see, Pope Shenouda ordained myriads of bishops, in some cases general bishops and in some cases he split up other dioceses. He typically ordained people who he knew that their line of thinking was more similar to the \"Sunday School movement.\" This is the first thing. Secondly, most Bishops whom he ordained were his children, or became his children, and felt a deep sense of duty/fidelity to him, not wanting to upset/diagree with him. So yes, Pope Shenouda's synod was clearly a magesterium, and as the head of the magesterium, he had control over the synod.\nAnd I also agree that general bishops should not be given a vote in the synod. Who are they representing? Themselves? Scripture and tradition in the Orthodox church have always grown out of community. But where is the community in Anba Labomba who takes care of the Pope's limousine having a vote in the synod? He represents no-one. If he does represent a group of people, why not just give him the diocese?\nThis is of course, my opinion.\nQawe, I think your statement is your opinion. But if you think it is fact then the burden of proof is on you to verify its veracity. Do you have any actual evidence that no general bishop would ever or has ever disagreed and voted against the Pope? Do you have any actual evidence that no diocese bishops has ever consistently voted with the pope simply because they did not want to disagree with the pope? You might be correct about general bishops. But we should avoid generalization without actual evidence.\nI agree with you that realistically, no one will publicly disagree and fight against the Pope. However, the Synod is neither setup as a pure democracy, nor a a tyrannical monarchal aristocracy. In a democracy, theoretically each person has equal weight in a vote and they are always free to express their views. A monarchal aristocracy, on the other hand, cares nothing for individual freedom. There is no voting in a monarchy. If it was, what's the point of voting at all? The same is true for the Synod. What is the point of voting, if all the bishops were not encouraged to express their views and opinions in ecclesiastical matters through their vote?\n(you do what your boss tells you).\nI own a business. I am the boss in my office. I can tell you for sure, I would fire an employee who is just a \"yes man\" and hire someone who has the confidence and courage to keep me inline for the wellness of the business. Any boss will tell you, unless you work in a crappy job that requires no thinking, no good business just wants to mindless employees. They want people who can increase production. They want a person who takes initiative, thinks for themselves and finds solutions (even if it is not what the boss normally expects).\nIt is unheard of until now for a bishop to have a boss.\nIs it unheard of that a bishop is part of a hierarchal system where he is equal among brothers yet all are servants to Christ? Has not Christ been the boss (called Master in liturgical and scriptural language) of all the bishops all along?\nEffective leadership brings many moving parts inline to one direction. The moving parts choose not to challenge their leader in every decision if there is positive results. The only ones who question a leader or a leader's system, are (1) those outside the system and (2) those who see negative results or failure. Are we outside the Synod's system or jurisdiction? Is the Synod failing in their job to shepherd Christ's people? Then why do we really care how general bishops vote?\nThank you Remnkemi for your non-polemical reply (not that I expected a polemical reply from you.\nHowever, the Synod is neither setup as a pure democracy, nor a a tyrannical monarchal aristocracy. In a democracy, theoretically each person has equal weight in a vote and they are always free to express their views.\nWhy should every bishop not have equal weight in a vote? Are they not equal?\nWhat is the point of voting, if all the bishops were not encouraged to express their views and opinions in ecclesiastical matters through their vote?\nAs a vestige of the past, when bishops were encouraged to express their views and opinions. There is no point in voting if there is a monarchal papacy.\nOf course Christ is the head of the church including the bishops. That is what I am arguing for, against what has happened in that we have moved towards the Roman Catholic model where the Pope is the Head of the Church, being Christ's representative on Earth.\nYou mention 'equal among brothers'. How are they equal if a general bishop cannot ordain priests?\nWhile the Pope is the leader, insofar as he is the chair of the Synod, he is not the decision maker, as is suggested in the bolded part of your post. As first among equals, his position is analogous to that of the See of Rome in the early Church. Thus, he is not their leader in the context of making decisions, such that an opposing opinion should be deemed a 'challenge'.\nYou are a lot more thoughtful and philosophical than me, so it is possible that I may have misunderstood some of your points. If so, please forgive me.\nQawe, sorry for the late response. Let's discuss this more.\nTheoretically, every bishop or every citizen of a governing body should have an equal vote. But no actual democratic system is setup this way. Why? Problems arise. Look at the US presidential process. Every American citizen over 18 is allowed to vote. But the President is not elected by popular votes. He is elected by the electoral college - who legally can vote against their respective popular vote. It has happened about 150 times in the past for many reasons. If the President was elected by popular vote only, a large state with many territories but few people will be counted as a small state with many people. So the founding fathers choose to construct a system whereby each state is represented by an electoral college, regardless of territory. This system makes some states more influential than others. Are not all states equal to the federal government? Yes, in honor but not in particular situations where blind equality would cause problems.\nI think the Synod has established a similar hierarchical system. All bishops are equal in honor but not in duties. The general bishop system was assumingly setup to avoid certain problems. Regardless of how fair or untraditional this general bishop system is, it is the system in place. It is still a \"democratic\" theocratic system (better than a lot of other systems out there). I understand many feel the system will inevitably transform into a theocratic electoral college like the Roman Catholic Church. Probably not. But even if it were to become reality, what is the harm if the system works? What is the harm if changing our system brings better results? If the Synod allows these changes, it must be for a good reason. I would go so far and say unless these changes result in heresy (which by definition is a failed system) it is the Holy Spirit who wants the changes.\nThis is assuming there is a monarchical system in place. During the nomination process, Bishop Paula interviewed then Bishop Tawadros and specifically wanted him to comment on this misconception. Pope Tawadros' response was along the lines of \"There is no competition. There is no 'my way or the highway.' The Pope is servant before he is master.\" (I'm paraphrasing a few interviews).\nSometimes bishops who discuss their dissatisfaction on certain matters will address it privately with the patriarch. If an amicable solution is not achieved in private, I think any bishop would vote against the majority if this said bishop had valid concerns (ie, pertaining to the specific issue of the vote). I think any bishop is encouraged to express his concerns. I think the majority of issues are resolved privately and when a vote is required in the synod, there is usually no disagreement. I may be naive, but I think this is what has routinely happened in the past.\nWhen Christ chose His disciples, he gave them all equal authority to loose and bind people's sin. There's the equality. However, Christ didn't let all 12 disciples lean on His chest. He gave all His disciples the power to see signs and wonders along with all the people, yet He chose three to see Him transfigured into light. There are so many examples of \"preceived favoritism\" which isn't favoritism at all. It's a foreshadowing of a hierarchical system of duties and glories. In 1 Corinthians 15, St Paul further stresses this \"unity with distinction\" in glory and duties. \"All flesh is not the same flesh [distinction], but there is one kind of flesh of men [unity], another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies [unity]; but the glory of the celestial is one [distinction], and the glory of the terrestrial is another [distinction].\" There is unity and distinction. Both celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies are both created bodies. But there is distinct glory for each. There is distinction because the role of each is needed in God's divine providence. This is what St Paul meant when he said, \"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.\" Again, a hierarchical system (in this case, a chronological hierarchy) is setup with a purpose. What is that purpose in this case? \"As we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man.\" The prior duty of earthly life is to lead to death which leads to spiritual eternal life. There is a distinction in duties.\nDoes this mean we are moving to a system where the Pope is the head of the Church? No. It will never happen in the Orthodox Church. But we should not discourage a system of solidarity with distinction because it is biblical and traditional.\nI didn't use the proper words to express my thoughts. My comments were not meant to imply the leader has exclusive decision making authority. Actually, the opposite is implied. Let me put it this way. Leadership by definition is a process where decisions are catalyzed into positive change and improvements. The leader brings about change. His authority as a leader, depending on the hierarchical system again, may or may not involve exclusive or absolute decision making. Most leaders, at least for corporations, simply propose an idea and the board of directors has the final authority for the decision. This leader may not even be part of the board but he is the catalyst that brings about the change. What I meant to focus on was effective leadership. If that leader is really, really effective the board will choose not to challenge the requested change. That doesn't mean the board relinquished decision making authority. It doesn't mean that a challenge to the proposed plan is seen as a challenge to authority. It doesn't mean that any opposing opinion is a challenge to the leader. It simply means the board of directors is so attuned with the leader that they always agree.\nThe bolded section excluded the first part of the sentence that confirms this line of thought: \"The moving parts choose not to challenge\". It doesn't mean the moving parts have lost their authority or that any opposition challenges the validity of the leader. The leader will always be the leader if he is effective in bringing positive improvements.\nI am the least of all of you. I come here to learn from all of you. There is no need to apologize for constructive criticism and open discussion.\nMy prayers are for our church and leadership that it continues in peace delivering us to Christ through the Holy Spirit.",

    "text": "Let\u2019s say you have an established practice. A \u201csuit\u201d could literally just walk in and offer to purchase your practice. Maybe your office was recommend to Heartland by colleague. If that sale goes through, your colleague will be themselves a tidy bonus\u2026let\u2019s call it a finders fee \u2013 $2500 to $5000 or there about.\nHeartland professes your office just becoming an \u201caffiliate\u201d \u2013 a term used quite loosely in the the world of corporate dentistry. But it has to be true, right? It\u2019s everywhere! It\u2019s all they say, they never mention owning dental clinics, just Heartland Affiliated Dental Centers.\nThey offer you a large sum of money to \u201caffiliate\u201d. A sum which is likely much more than the practice is actually worth if it were for sale.\nBut you\u2019re not selling, right? You are simply becoming \u201caffiliated\u201d with Heartland so they can help you with your day to day operations \u2013 marketing, advertising, software, billing, etc.\nFor whatever reason, you decided to take their offer. and become a Heartland Dental \u201caffiliated\u201d dental center. What happens then?\nIn the employment agreement, they will agree to a not so bad salary, $120K \u2013$150K a year, plus a percentage of profits. By profits, I mean \u201cnet\u201d profits.\nContrary to what Heartland said, you just sold your practice and you just became their employee.\nYes, that is what is said, but it\u2019s a lie. You are simply their employee forever more, or until you can get fired.\nSo you are now \u201caffiliated\u201d with Heartland Dental. What happens next?\nYou and your entire staff are whisked off to Effingham, IL for training. I say entire staff, but that might not be the staff you planned on keeping around. That staffing choice is no longer yours to decide \u2013 it\u2019s Heartland Dental\u2019s. There just went all that control of your practice promised!\nHeartland Dental didn\u2019t need that new $7.7 million training facility \u2013 HDC Institute. for nothing. They are going to be training you!\nIn fact, it\u2019s likely any future training you get will be right there in Effingham at Heartland Dental.\nWhile your office is closed, not producing income, and you and your staff are away at training camp, things maybe happening back at the office. A team may be invade what was once your office. This team is there to strip out your equipment and replace it with Heartlands. What was once your equipment, will be replace Heartland\u2019s own \u2013 which could, and likely will, be of lesser quality. But hey, it\u2019s got their software already loaded and ready to go.\nChop! Chop! Get to work!\nWhat happens at the 1 to 2 week training sessions, other than your balance sheet taking a dive \u2013 remember, if you are in Effingham, you ain\u2019t workin\u2019. You and staff are learning the Heartland Way, that\u2019s what.\nMr. Dentist, you are now to do nothing but procedures. You will do them as we are teaching you, it\u2019s the only way you can meet the goals we are setting for your \u201caffiliated\u201d clinic. We might throw in some orthodontics training on a three day trip, if other revenue sources are needed, who knows.\nOh and the \u201cpartnership\u201d plan mention in the propaganda piece, it\u2019s really an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). While most ESOP\u2019s are stock given to the employee at no cost, you might be asked to \u201ccontribute\u201d a $100K to Heartland\u2019s ESOP. Doesn\u2019t that just sound yummy. You get $100k worth of Heartland Stock. Rick get\u2019s money for lunch.\nIt\u2019s called a PA, not Public Address System nor, Physician's Assistant, but Practice Administrator. These little jewels go through extensive training at HDC Institute and are taught how to \u201chandle\u201d unruly dentists, so don\u2019t be unruly.\nContinuing Education? That will be done right at HDC Institute. You will get what they are serving. No matter if you could get it locally, for 1/3 the fee, less time away from the office.\nMs. Office Manager, you are now in charge of all treatment plans, presenting said plans to patients and pricing. [Nothing like a medically untrained office staff talking tell a patient about complicated medical procedures to make said patient safe!] If you can\u2019t handle it, Ms. Office Manager, we have someone trained to step in at any time, but under no circumstance will Mr. Dentist being doing treatment plans. He\u2019s to produce, nothing more.\nNothing is for free, ya know.\nThat training Heartland demands, costs money and your clinic\u2019s revenues is going to pay for every dime of it. Could be as much as $3k-$5k per day. A Friday, Saturday, Sunday, pep rally, well, that may be $10k.\nThe Heartland brand continuing education, well that will come off your \u201caffiliated\u201d clinic\u2019s bottom line. too. Not only that, but you pay, what Heartland wants to charge. So what if you could get it cheaper and closer to your home. So what your office could be seeing patients those days.\nIf Rick Workman has to fly someone in to get you lined back out, for under production. It is going to cost ya. Every business mile driven, every night in a hotel, every meal they eat, your clinic picks up that tab. The college educated psychology grad - who is really just a company dental hygienist - sent to assess your nonproductive ways, will also be expensed out to your clinic.\nPrizes and gifts for company wide employees, those are expensed out among the \u201caffiliated\u201d clinics too. Remember that bonus your colleague got for recommending your practice to Heartland, yeah, it will be charged to your \u201caffiliated\u201d clinic.\nMonthly seminars to Effingham,IL, are going to cost you as well. Every night in the hotel, every chicken leg you eat, it\u2019s coming out of your \u201caffiliated\u201d clinic\u2019s account. Think you will be given a breakdown of what Heartland Headquarters has expensed to your \u201caffiliated\u201d clinic, think again! Those are not for your eyes.\nYou know the new HCD Institute will be expensed out to each Heartland Dental \u201caffiliated\u201d dental center as well. It has to be, everything else is.\nLast but not least, your \u201caffiliated\u201d clinic has to pay Heartland for all the administrative services as well.",

To be crystal clear: a free press is an essential component of a healthy, vibrant democracy and it would be strange for the media to completely censure views. Furthermore, journalists only have a finite amount of real estate to work with. Also, journalism is a real-time business and a tough gig. Hence here I am taking the opportunity to more clearly lay out from a scientific viewpoint why the piece being reported upon is fundamentally flawed and the IPCC SR1.5 report stands on its merits.\nThe societal response and policy aspects I shall leave for another day but suffice to say I am more optimistic and view national leadership on acting on climate change, if done right, as a real national opportunity for all Irish citizens.\nAnd that the statement did not necessarily assert that more than half of the warming is due to human influences. He goes on to contend that SR1.5 departs from AR5 in contending that all the warming is due to human influence.\nFigure SPM6 from IPCC AR5 WG1 report. Changes for simulations with human influences (pink) and without (blue) for a range of global and continental and ocean / cryosphere indicators. Human influences explain effectively all the change seen since the early 20th Century.\nFigure 10.5 showing attributable contributions to the observed change (black bar) from Grrenhouse gases, all anthropogenic forcings, non-greenhouse gas anthropogenic forcings, natural forcings and internal variability. The best estimate is that anthropogenic contribution to warming slightly exceeds that observed (balanced by variability / natural forcings). It is in no way only half the warming.\nSo, does SR1.5 start from a distinct premise from the AR5 conclusions around attributable warming contribution from us humans? That\u2019ll be a resounding no.\nRay Bates goes on in his piece to imply nefarious intent behind the IPCC considering only the post-1960 series of GMST in their SPM figure. The choice is reasonable because the attribution statement in AR5 (and the prior figure) pertained to post-1950 changes. Furthermore, in the underlying chapter 1 Figure 1.2 the full series from 1850 is shown. The SR1.5 is hardly ignoring the early period as implied is it?\nRay Bates then goes on to show a satellite dataset that shows less warming than the surface. It is true that the UAH dataset does, indeed, show less warming than the surface. What\u2019s the issue? Well, satellite data are no gold standard. You put a delicate instrument on top of a controlled explosion to send it into space then expose it to vagaries in space weather. Unlike the surface there are not hundreds of instruments there is one. It can drift in the sampling and it can degrade in performance over time. What happens if another group also go to the trouble of creating a product from the same instruments in space? Well, they find greater warming than at the surface. I\u2019m not going to argue one of these is right and the other wrong. I\u2019m just pointing out that satellites aint no gold standard. Indeed, AR5 concluded that the surface was robust whereas the tropospheric changes while certain of the sign (warming) were uncertain in magnitude. As I lead that portion of the AR5 assessment I am uniquely qualified to make this statement.\nRay Bates goes on to throw in a couple of red herrings on the Oceans for good measure. He states that an emerging signal of warming of land faster than oceans in the observed record is problematic. Well, no, its actually what we expect as an emerging signal of climate change and it will only get worse. As SR1.5 points out much of the global land domain already experiences seasonally or annually changes exceeding 1.5C.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Here is Figure 12.11 of the SPM of AR5. Note how the land warms more than the oceans in all cases. Note also how our choices matter in determining future generations climate.\nFigure 12.11 from AR5. Land robustly warms more than oceans. I sure don\u2019t want my descendants inheriting that bottom right world. Can we please make efforts to make the top right reality?\nThese preliminary results are considered of interest for the ongoing community efforts focusing on coupled data assimilations.\nWhy would IPCC be expected to rely upon an experimental data assimilation system analysis? Well, exactly.\nThe section on climate model tuning is very confused indeed. I was involved, when at the Met Office, in the model tuning and evaluation exercises. I saw lots of effort concerned around getting critical processes such as El Nino, mid-latitude storm tracks and monsoon variations adequately as well as the mean state. I never saw an effort to tune the model to reproduce the observed trends or to determine some state in 2100 in the projections. I also saw significant efforts to run perturbed ensembles and these have been done even more so in the citizen science www.climateprediction.net experiments. To claim that the model tuning is an issue that is unexplored or a major issue is incorrect.\nThe section on ECS is, to put it politely, selective. Fortunately I don\u2019t have to waste many words here as there has been a recent major review piece written by Reto Knutti and colleagues - the figures are not behind the paywall and any number of these give a much more holistic assessment as to the state of our knowledge on the topic. The bottom line is that contrary to the assertion of Ray Bates if anything the lower bound on ECS has increased since AR5. The good news here is there is a whole chapter devoted to it and related matters in AR6.\nRay has had a long and distinguished career. But that career has been in atmospheric dynamics and not climate. Yes, both are to do with the atmosphere, but when your toilet is backing up you call the plumber and not the electrician. In the same way when looking for guidance on climate change it is advisable to listen to the climate scientists of which there are many thousands the vast majority of whom (and I mean vast) concur with the broad findings of the IPCC and various national assessments and national academies that climate change is real, its due to us, and that our choices now are of critical import. Equally, if you want to discuss the intricacies of atmospheric dynamics please don\u2019t come knocking at my door!\nDrought has begun to fade from the national conversation following a week of rain, but observations show that Dublin remains in the grip of the one of the most intense flash droughts, probably the most, since at least the middle of the nineteenth Century.\nThere are numerous definitions of drought. None are perfect. In Ireland we have tended to use an index called the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al. 1993). This makes sense in that most of the time it is a lack of rainfall that leads to drought in our relatively moderate climate. But there are other indexes such as the Standardised Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (Vicente-Serrano et al.2010) which, in addition, account for removal of water via evaporation and plant transpiration. This index is arguably better for characterising flash droughts that tend to occur in the warm season. It uses a combination of monthly rainfall and temperature records.\nThe Noone et al. (2015) assessment of variability and change in precipitation over the period 1850\u20132010 indicates positive trends in winter and negative trends in summer precipitation. Noone et al. (2017) produced a 250 year drought catalogue for the Island of Ireland by applying SPI-12 ( a 12 month drought index) to identify long hydrological drought rich periods. The results show that Ireland is drought prone but recent decades are unrepresentative of the longer-term drought climatology. Ireland has experienced seven long drought rich periods over the period 1850-2015 impacting the whole of the island of Ireland; (1854\u20131860, 1884\u20131896,1904\u20131912, 1921\u20131923, 1932\u20131935, 1952\u20131954 and 1969\u20131977). But it is also possible to have \u2018flash\u2019 droughts, such as that in 2018.\nPhoenix Park is one of the longest continuous meteorological stations in Ireland. Records started in the early 1800s and continue through present. This long record is thanks to the significant efforts of Met Eireann, Ordnance Survey Ireland and others. Although instrumentation has changed over time, the site has always stood in the grounds of Ordnance Survey Ireland and the regional environment has remained largely unchanged. The precipitation series was homogenised by ICARUS as part of Noone et al. (2015). The temperature record has not been homogenised to date.* Met Eireann make monthly and daily summaries available. To perform the present assessment we have appended the July daily values aggregated to monthly averages** to the long monthly series and calculated SPEI-3 (a 3 month drought index) for the entire series.\nThe provisional value of SPEI-3 for May to July is -2.70 which is the most extreme value on record, beating October 1995 by a whisker***. The next most extreme was August 1995. Before that the index values are sufficiently different to conclude that either 2018 or 1995 represent the worst flash drought since modern meteorological records began in Ireland, with 2018 marginally more likely.\nSPEI-3 values calculated at Phoenix Park January 1850 to July 2018. Red lines show 3 month accumulative deficits and blue lines show 3 month accumulative surplus.\nOne important thing to note is that the two most extreme prior months occurred in the same year. This shows that drought can appear to diminish only to quickly return. We may well have had a week of rain (although even that in Phoenix Park amounted to only 47% of the long term monthly average rainfall for July), but that does not even begin to undo months of deficit.\nTable of the ten most extreme values of SPEI-3 in the Phoenix Park record. Negative values denote deficits. The more negative the index the more severe the drought conditions.\nPerhaps more worrying still is the seasonal forecasts for the coming two months which show a real possibility of the meteorological set-up that led to the current drought returning and persisting. Don\u2019t be fooled by a week of recent rains. We are potentially far from done yet.\nCurrent seasonal forecast output from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration CFSv2 system. Daily deficits of >-0.2mm/day are predicted. Note large uncertainties exist in seasonal prediction systems which should only be used as indicative guidance.\n** Another reason to say probably rather than definitively in that monthly summaries have quality control applied by Met Eireann which may lead to a mismatch between the aggregated to monthly daily reports and eventual monthly summary of record.\n*** Yet another reason to say probably rather than definitively.\nNoone S, Murphy C, Coll J, Matthews T, Mullan D, Wilby RL, Walsh S.

    "text": "Former Florida State football players put their talents on display ahead of the upcoming NFL Draft.\nFlorida State\u2019s football program has churned out tons of professional talent in the past few years, boasting 33 players on NFL rosters at the beginning of the 2018 season.\nThis year\u2019s draft class looks to add to that number, as their talents were on full display for Thursday\u2019s Pro Day at the Dunlap Athletic Training Facility. The \u2019Noles who turned out for the event participated in a series of strength and conditioning drills before splitting up to perform various exercises specific to their position, all with NFL scouts and coaches analyzing their mechanics and motions.\nFor some, FSU\u2019s Pro Day was little more than a formality, as was the case for defensive end Brian Burns. Currently projected to be taken in the first round of this year\u2019s NFL Draft, Burns\u2019 impressive performance at the NFL Combine left little for him to prove heading into the day\u2019s events.\nAs such, the six-foot-five defensive end opted to focus mainly on position drills, allowing NFL scouts to assess his mobility and ability to change direction in space. With the draft less than a month away, Burns has been in contact with the Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans.\nFollowing his drills, Burns spoke about how well both he and his teammates performed on the day as they prepare for the NFL Draft.\nFor other players, such as defensive tackle Demarcus Christmas and wide receiver Nyqwan Murray, Pro Day was a chance to brush up on and perform better in drills that each struggled with at the NFL Combine.\nHoping to perform better without all of the uncomfortable spotlight of the Combine, Christmas was satisfied with his Pro Day performance in a facility that former Seminoles like himself had previously practiced in and were familiar with.\nChristmas\u2019 improvement on the 40-yard dash from a 5.08 at the NFL Combine to a 4.90 on Thursday solidified a successful outcome for him.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t smooth sailing for Murray unfortunately, as he pulled up during a position-specific catching drill clutching his hamstring and mouthing, \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d to assembled onlookers.\nThe wide receiver\u2019s Pro Day performance was certainly limited by his recent injury, as he was unable to run the 40-yard dash due to the pain. Murray also felt he could have done better running routes in position drills if it weren\u2019t for his injured leg.\nOn the other hand, defensive back A.J. Westbrook certainly made the most of his Pro Day, as he rode a fast start to an overall strong performance, literally.\nIn the 40-yard dash, which was the first event of the day, the Daytona Beach, Florida native made scouts do a double take as he posted a 4.40 finish. Westbrook then translated that success to his positional drills, keeping the scouts\u2019 eyes on him despite the fact that several NFL personnel in attendance were likely there to see other players first.\nIn any case, Thursday\u2019s Pro Day officially sealed the college careers of this year\u2019s Florida State draft class. The Garnet & Gold will once again be well represented in the draft, with Burns projected to be a first-round pick, Christmas expected to be selected between the third and fifth rounds, and a slew of Seminoles likely to be taken after the fifth round.\nMarch 24, 2019, 3:12 p.m.\nMarch 31, 2019, 5:18 p.m.",

    "text": "The University of Maryland President Wallace Loh.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace Loh stood before reporters Aug. 14 and apologized to the family of Jordan McNair, a football player who died days after a team workout. That day, Loh also announced a commission charged with examining the culture inside the school's embattled football program, an undertaking that could prompt sweeping changes at the state's flagship university.\nIn June, the school had contracted with an outside consulting firm to investigate the events surrounding McNair's death. But the commission Loh announced nearly two months later would be charged with a broader inquiry into the culture of the school's football program - a \"thorough investigation by an independent group,\" Loh said - following media reports that suggested some coaches were abusive toward players, relying on fear, intimidation and bullying.\nFew details about the group's work to date are publicly available, but the commission's directives and composition reveal some of the inherent obstacles that arise when independent bodies investigate problems in university athletic departments.\nIn an initial email to the newly-appointed commission members, a copy of which was viewed by The Washington Post, Loh advised that some of the allegations they would be investigating \"probably occur in every football program\" and that the line between aggressive and abusive training techniques is \"imprecise.\"\nAlso, several of the commission members have previous ties with the university and the stakeholders in the affair. One served as a personal advisor to Loh. Another is the brother of an influential booster.\nAlmost immediately after the commission's unveiling, the University System of Maryland's board of regents took control from the College Park campus, adding five additional members to the three named by Loh and suggesting that key decisions about the football program's future would be made by the regents, not necessarily the school president. The vice chair of the board of regents is a prominent donor to the athletics department and has voiced public support for head football coach DJ Durkin.\nThis investigation could go a long way to determining the fate of Durkin, who was placed on administrative leave along with three other member of the athletic staff in the immediate aftermath of the media reports. One of those, football strength and conditioning coach Rick Court, has negotiated a settlement and resigned.\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the process, Durkin was interviewed by investigators on the morning of Aug. 22, and they were particularly keen on questioning Durkin about his alleged use of food to demean players, possible verbal abuse and his handling of injuries.\nThe commission's review is expected to also look at the actions of other prominent coaches and staff members, including Damon Evans, who was promoted to athletics director less than two weeks after McNair's death. Loh, too, could find himself scrutinized by one or both of the external probes. He nixed a plan recommended by the school's athletic director to fundamentally change the way athletes receive medical treatment and athletic training less than a year before McNair died.\nThere is no formal deadline for the commission to complete its review of the football program.\n\"We're trying to get that all done this month, one way or another, so that all the facts we can gather are in front of the board and the campus and then decisions can be made about the future,\" Robert Caret, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said in an interview last week, \"both to protect student-athletes themselves but also to create the kind of environment we want.\"\nA day after he addressed reporters, Loh sent an email to his three new commission members, as well as a handful of school officials, laying out the assignment. He told them \"to interview a sufficiently large sample of current and former players, their parents, athletics staff , and any other relevant stakeholders, in order to make an assessment on whether the relatively few (but deeply troubling) cases of alleged 'abuse,' reported anonymously in the media, indicate the existence of a widespread 'toxic culture' . . . or, do these reported cases represent only a small portion of the population of football players, present and past.\"\nLoh told the members that \"arguably, a hyper-masculine and insular culture is the norm, rather than the exception, in college football.\" Furthermore, he advised them that \"some of the alleged verbally abusive or demeaning behaviors probably occur in every football program. It is part of the 'football culture.' There is, of course, an imprecise line between training practices that aggressively push players to the limit and are acceptable, and practices that most reasonable persons would deem to be physical and/or emotional abusive conduct.'\"\nAsked about Loh's email, Maryland spokesperson Katie Lawson said: \"The president acknowledges that athletic programs are by their nature demanding and intense, and he asked commission members to investigate if Maryland's program crosses a line into destructive or abusive, which is absolutely unacceptable. President Loh has been clear that if such behavior did exist here, it will not be tolerated.\"\nAfter assuming ownership of the investigation two days later, the board of regents added five more members to the commission, including former Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich and Tom McMillen, the former Terps' basketball star who served three terms in Congress.\nIn expanding the panel, the regents faced the delicate task of appointing people who are sufficiently knowledgeable about football and the school but not too partisan.\n\"Ideally, you want somebody who has more than a passing familiarity with that space and the cultures that exist in that space,\" said a veteran college sports administrator, who requested anonymity so he could speak candidly about the process. \"At the same time, that can cause people to be apologists for all that behavior. That's one of the inherent challenges. I know some of the people on the Maryland committee. They're good people, but many are affiliated with the University of Maryland.\nRichard Legon, president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said the composition of the Maryland commission on its face appears sound.\n\"I think if you have a former a member of Congress, a former governor, other prestigious leaders who are connected or not to the institution, what you can get to is an outcome with a high degree of credibility,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, credibility allows the board to put greater stock into the recommendations and take whatever actions they're going to take.\"\nThe web of relationships surrounding the Maryland probe is thorny and highlights several areas of possible concern. The eight commission members, who will be compensated for their work, either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nLoh made Alex Williams, a well-respected retired U.S. District judge, one of his three initial appointees to the commission. Williams is the founder, chief executive and namesake of a center focused on justice and ethics housed within the university's school of behavioral and social sciences.\nPrior to joining the commission, Williams had served as a pro bono personal advisor to Loh following the death of Richard Collins III, a 23-year-old student at nearby Bowie State University, who was killed on Maryland's College Park campus in May 2017.\nDon Scheeler, past president of the Terrapin Club, left his name off a letter in support of Durkin that was sent last month to the regents from the Champions Club, a group of high-level sports boosters. His brother, Charles Scheeler, was another of the three commission members appointed by Loh.\nCharles Scheeler is a Baltimore-based attorney at the law firm DLA Piper, who previously served as the \"independent monitor\" charged with tracking Penn State's implementation of recommendations made in the report that followed the Jerry Sandusky scandal.\nHe also was a top deputy for Sen. George Mitchell a decade ago in the exhaustive investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Scheeler and his associates at DLA Piper have done much of the commission's investigative legwork behind the scenes.\nAsked about the inclusion of Williams and Scheeler, a spokesman said in a statement to The Post: \"Both have the objectivity and talent to contribute greatly to an impartial investigation of the culture of the University of Maryland, College Park football program.\n\"But they are only two of the eight member independent commission, which is comprised of individuals with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, from both in Maryland and outside the state,\" the statement continued. \"The commission's membership is sufficiently large, fair-minded and diverse in perspective to effectively follow the facts wherever they may lead.\"\nIn addition to Ehrlich and McMillen, the other commission members are retired U.S. District Court Judge Ben Legg; Doug Williams, the former Redskins quarterback who serves as the senior vice president of player personnel for the team; Bonnie Bernstein, an alumnus of the school and veteran sports broadcaster; and Frederick Azar, the chief of staff at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics in Memphis.\nIt's not known how hands-on all eight of the commission members have been. Two of the eight commission members live outside the area, and others have demanding, full-time jobs.\n\"I think the vast majority of them will have had some hands-on experience,\" Caret said in an interview last week. \"I don't know if they've met face to face or not. I know they've all talked.\"\nA spokesman for the regents said that once the commission has completed its examination, it will share its findings with the board of regents, which will then \"make whatever decisions are necessary to better safeguard and support all students and student-athletes.\" The board of regents is made up of 17 unpaid members who oversee Maryland's system of 12 colleges. With the exception of one student representative, each member is appointed by the governor and can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.\nBarry Gossett is a vice chair of the board of regents and also one of the most influential athletic boosters the school has ever known. He donated $10 million in 2007 to build the football program's \"team house,\" which bears his name, and this spring pledged more than $21 million - one of the largest donations the school has ever received - to a center focused on athletes' academic studies.\n\"From a donor standpoint, I kind of stand behind DJ and his program and what he has been doing,\" Gossett told The Post in an interview before the university placed the coach on leave.\nGossett did not respond to requests to comment last week. He had been tending recently to his wife, Mary, who died Monday. The couple have been donors to the school since 1971, championing causes both in and outside of athletics.\n\"Barry Gossett is a highly regarded member of the Maryland community who has served, and continues to serve, the state in countless ways,\" a spokesman for the board of regents said in an email last week. \"At the same time, he is only one of 17 members of the Board of Regents, which will receive the findings of the independent commission.\"\nLike Don Scheeler, Gossett left his name off the Champions Club letter supporting Durkin.\nThe board doesn't typically play a role in personnel decisions at the system's schools, though it does have oversight over Loh, who has led the state's flagship university since 2010.\n\"The board obviously can have influence on the president,\" Caret said.\nStephen Ross, a Penn State sports law professor who directs a cross-campus center on sports issues, said the pre-existing relationships on these investigative bodies aren't usually as important as the underlying motivation behind the appointment.\nHe says there are scenarios where those pre-existing ties could undermine an investigation but others in which they could lend credibility, diversify the commission and appease stakeholders in the event of a critical report.\n\"To me, an ad hoc committee designed to deal with a major public relations problem is itself an exercise in strategic communication,\" he said.\nThere is no rulebook for such investigations and schools can pursue them on their own terms. Similar external examinations have been conducted at schools such as Ohio State, Michigan State and Penn State, facing widespread criticism from some corners unhappy with different facets of the respective probes or findings.\nThe Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges issued a formal statement to schools in 2009 saying \"it is time for all [governing] boards to re-examine how they exercise their oversight responsibilities.\" The organization urged governing bodies, such as Maryland's board of regents, to refrain \"from fostering personal relationships with the athletics director or coaches,\" and urging them to \"exercise appropriate oversight while avoiding micromanagement, viewing athletics with a dispassionate perspective.\"\n\"We don't want them running college sports,\"Legon said, \"but we want them to recognize the buck stops with them.\"",

Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter are being impacted by slow sales of the Company\u2019s products, which has resulted in low order volumes from carriers. Palm also expects to close its fourth fiscal quarter with a cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance between $350 million and $400 million.\n$90 million in revenues for an average ASP of $300 would put unit sales at 300,000 for the quarter. RIM just sold 10.4 million devices, Apple sold 8.75 million. 300k is just an astonishingly small number.\nHuawei has largely rejected Palm\u2019s request for a buyout, a tip said this morning. Palm had reportedly proposed that Huawei take over the company in mid-February but hasn\u2019t made any progress since. It\u2019s not clear what objections, if any, Huawei might have.\nvia Palm rebuffed by Huawei on takeover talks | Electronista.\nDubinsky gets it, Glaser no so much.\n[Rob Glaser] said with those \u201csuper\u201d abilities, mobile has a great potential, but if Apple gets its way, the wireless industry could end up like the MP3 industry. The other option is for things to go the way of the PC, which he considers more horizontal.\nSorry Rob, you\u2019re still missing the whole point. It\u2019s not incredible, it\u2019s the only way to go. What\u2019s incredible is that anybody tried to do it differently.",

    "text": "SETTING UP YOUR MIND SET FOR SUCCESS: YOUR MINDSET IS THE BACKBONE OF YOUR SUCCESS.\nHave you ever wondered why some people are successful? Why the rich get richer? The answer is that they have focus, a mind-set, they do continuous learning and dedication to achieve the success they set as goals, visions, mission and purpose. In our world today, focusing on changing your mind-set sounds time-consuming. However, it is important to keep in right mind, otherwise stepping out of your comfort zone or learning from your failures may not be possible either.\nHumans have different thinking patterns which mostly are produced from our habit loops. They are large part of what makes you and me. Our identities are borne from the convergence of these patterns. They create our subjective experience.\nSo once we change our mind-set and begin to see things from the inner circle, the outer world begins to respond automatically.\nFirst of all we need to understand that each of us faces different challenges at different times in different ways based both on our biology and our unique cultural upbringing. No two people think exactly the same way because no two people have lived exactly the same life.\n\u00b7 Understanding our programed mind is the first step toward success.\nAs zat rana writer with medium states \u2018\u2019How we think affects everything from our ability to solve problems, to how we understand meaning, value, and purpose. Real change doesn\u2019t just happen but takes critical change from our mindset and overcoming challenges.\n\u00b7 Overcome fear. Your ability to recognize that fear causes limitations in your life. It\u2019s easy to get attached to your thoughts and feelings that it is okay and that is the way it is. Successful people don\u2019t take things the way they are they take up the fight and go beyond \u2018okay\u2019 standards. you are not your fears. You are the awareness that experiences it.\n\u00b7 Believing in yourself. Do you know who you are? What are your strength and weakness? Knowing that you can do something and believing that you have what it takes is success in the making. Once you change your mind-set, opportunities come to you, but if you don\u2019t change then you will keep chasing opportunities.\n\u00b7 Choose your company wisely. The saying goes \u2018show me your friends and I will tell you who you\u2019re\u2019 successful people surround themselves with mentors, business gurus, and people of same influence. The circle of Friendships, relationships, and Associations should enable you to grow and lead you to success, otherwise to be successful, sometimes we need to let go those that are not contributing significantly in our lives.\n\u00b7 Create your vision and mission. Have a huge vision bigger than yourself so it makes you uncomfortable and sleepless till you achieve it. This is why they say rich men don\u2019t sleep. When your vision does not make you sleep then you ought to do what\u2019s supposed to be done to achieve it.\n\u00b7 Challenge accepted/ adventure into the unknown. The ability to come out of fear and from the known to unknown is the power to create what you want and wealth in abundance. The main secret to success is knowing what you want and being willing to pay the price for what it takes. It\u2019s Taking one step at a time.\n\u00b7 Open mindedness and Willingness to change.\n\u00b7 Conscious and Unconscious mind. Create harmony between your conflicting conscious and unconscious mind, this can be by visualizing and continuous meditation of your goals and vision on daily basis so they become part of what you see, smell, feel, touch and talk.\nOpen mindedness and Willingness to change. A mind free from limited ideas that is willing to change and open to welcome new intuitions and ideologies. How we think affects everything from our ability to solve problems to how we understand values, logic, meaning and purpose of things.\nIn the same way we form habits of action relating to our environment, we also form habits of thought when it comes to how we think about the world. We are all born into a reality in which\u200a\u2014\u200aat first, at least\u200a\u2014\u200awe can\u2019t even distinguish between our own separateness from the world.\nWith time, however, we start to recognize patterns around us, and we internalize these patterns\u200alike habits\u200aso that we can reuse them in the future. Usually, if a pattern persists in our mental habits, it means that it is valuable in some sense. But this is only the case if we apply that pattern to the right information.\nOne of the reasons it\u2019s so hard to change our minds about things is that our brains are stuck in these mental habit loops, which tend to look at information from a singular point of view. Our brains have learned something in one context, so they mistakenly apply it to others, mixing up the triggers that lead to routine thoughts.\nBut the good news is we\u2019re all capable of overpowering these habit loops, it\u2019s very productive to have these habits operating as the default mode. To think well, we must be aware of their limitations and to not let them restrict us.\nTrue success stories are built only after you resolve the things which are affecting your life. The problems you are facing, your weak points and stop talking negative about yourself.\nThe journey to a successful life is not a straight line, it\u2019s a bumpy road full of difficulties and setbacks. The average person would give up along the way, but a champion would stay resilient. It\u2019s the mindset that makes a true difference. The fact is that the more obstacles you overcome, the more resilient you become.\nAs Ken Chennault, CEO of American Express, has a nice tip for everyone who wants to become successful: \u201cDedicate yourself to a core set of values. Without them, you will never be able to find personal fulfilment, and you will never be able to lead effectively.\nc) Invest in yourself by getting mentors, reading books and get trainings.\nd) Mastermind with the leaders. Trust In yourself.\ne) Start the journey taking one step at a time through learning, doing and teaching.\nSuccess is about setting your mind-set and making changes based on responsibility and action. It is overcoming fear and getting out of the known to the unknown. It is about overcoming failure as a person.\nhttps://thesixfigurementors.com/?id=susanakello. Learn how to set up your mind for success and become a successful career person.\nSharing is caring. What is your mind-set change story and how can you assist a person like you in the same fear state? Please let\u2019s share your story.",

PISTA\u00ae Grit Concentrators are available in both 250 and 500 GPM (16 and 32 lps) models.\nThe new Smith & Loveless PISTA\u00ae DURALYTE\u00ae 250 GPM (16 lps) Grit Concentrator combines uncompromising strength and acclaim for superior grit concentrator performance. Specially-designed for large flow applications, the PISTA\u00ae DURALYTE\u00ae effectively washes collected grit while delivering extended service life beyond standard concentrator designs. The top section is constructed of Ni-Hard, with a minimum thickness of 3/4\u201d (1.9 cm) in high wear areas. The bottom section features a minimum of 3/4\u201d(1.9 cm) thickness of a proprietary polyurethane blend molded with a proprietary blend of silicon carbide (minimum of 1/2\u201d (1.3 cm) thickness) in the high wear area of the bottom portion of the cone. Additionally, a large underflow opening of 3.75\u201d (9.5 cm) minimizes clogging. The inlet connection is 4-1/2\u201d (11.4 cm) outside diameter. This 2-piece material combination is designed to better withstand the abrasive action common with high grit loads. More durable than hard iron designs and longer lasting than models with wearing liners, the PISTA\u00ae DURALYTE\u00ae makes cone handling simple because of the lightweight material.\nThe PISTA\u00ae DURALYTE\u00ae effectively functions as a primary grit washing and dewatering device, separating the pumped flow into basic components of water, organics and grit. Working in concert with the PISTA\u00ae Grit Screw Conveyor or the PISTA\u00ae TURBO\u2122 Grit Washer, which it is positioned over and discharges into, the PISTA\u00ae DURALYTE\u00ae Grit Concentrator\u2019s overall performance achieves greater than 95 percent removal of the residual organic material.\nLonger expected life than cast iron / steel alternatives.\nNo neoprene liners to replace.\nReturn of 95% of residual organic material to the grit removal chamber.\nHow Does DURALYTE\u00ae Compare to Other Materials?",

A nationally representative sample of 52\u202f037 children aged 18 years or younger who presented to the ED were included. Data analysis was performed in August 2018.\nThe outcomes were critical care (admission to an intensive care unit and/or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the training set (70% random sample), using routinely available triage data as predictors (eg, demographic characteristics and vital signs), we derived 4 machine learning-based models: lasso regression, random forest, gradient-boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. In the test set (the remaining 30% of the sample), we measured the models' prediction performance by computing C statistics, prospective prediction results, and decision curves. These machine learning models were built for each outcome and compared with the reference model using the conventional triage classification information.\nOf 52\u202f037 eligible ED visits by children (median [interquartile range] age, 6 [2-14] years; 24\u202f929 [48.0%] female), 163 (0.3%) had the critical care outcome and 2352 (4.5%) had the hospitalization outcome. For the critical care prediction, all machine learning approaches had higher discriminative ability compared with the reference model, although the difference was not statistically significant (eg, C statistics of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.92] for the deep neural network vs 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71-0.85] for the reference; P\u2009=\u2009.16), and lower number of undertriaged critically ill children in the conventional triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to nonurgent). For the hospitalization prediction, all machine learning approaches had significantly higher discrimination ability (eg, C statistic, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.78-0.81] for the deep neural network vs 0.73 [95% CI, 0.71-0.75] for the reference; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and fewer overtriaged children who did not require inpatient management in the conventional triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). The decision curve analysis demonstrated a greater net benefit of machine learning models over ranges of clinical thresholds.\nMachine learning-based triage had better discrimination ability to predict clinical outcomes and disposition, with reduction in undertriaging critically ill children and overtriaging children who are less ill.",

    "text": "The 47th United Nations General Assembly held its first special meeting on disability issues in October 1992. The General Assembly passed a resolution to make December 3 each year the \u201cInternational Day of Disabled Persons\u201d.\nThere are an estimated one billion people in the world with disabilities, accounting for over 15% of the world's population. The majority of these people live in developing countries. Over the years, with the efforts of the international community, the world has made some progress in protecting the rights of people with disabilities and building a barrier-free society. However, discrimination persists. For example, in many countries, up to 80% of people with disabilities cannot find work.\nTherefore, the theme of this year\u2019s International Day of Disabled Persons is: \u201cempowering disabled people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality.\u201d As the UN Secretary-General said in his 2017 address, \u201clet us create opportunities that truly leave no one behind\u201d.\nThe International Day of Disabled Persons on December 3 is an annual event aimed at promoting people's understanding of disability issues and mobilizing support for the protection of the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities.\nAccording to statistics, there are more than 60 million disabled people in our country. Because of their disabilities, there are still some disabled people who are discriminated against by others in our society, which makes them encounter many difficulties in their work, study and life.\nIf we meet people with disabilities in our daily life, we should try our best to help them.\nFor example, on the bus, we should take the initiative to give up seat to the disabled;when walking on the street, people with disabilities should be helped to cross the street.We should also help push the wheelchairs of disabled people if we can.\nStudents of Haileybury Tianjin, let us all take the initiative to help the disabled and other people in need.",

    "text": "This is one of the many things in my life as a gay man that I cannot take for granted. Even if Bob and I were to marry in New York State, there is no guarantee that an emergency room in another state would honor our marriage, or respect the 23 years we\u2019ve shared together, or the fact that my health effects Bob as much as it does me, or that his presence at my side could actually help me heal or keep me alive. I cannot presume that or any of the basic rights and needs that straight couples can take for granted. My legal right to property, bank accounts, employment, protection from hate-based violence, and more, are currently being voted on from state-to-state and argued by presidential candidates as if my civil rights and happiness are a mater of public opinion.\nThe thing is, when it comes to my rights as a gay man, I\u2019ve never taken anything for granted. Growing up in the Midwest of the 1960s and \u201970s, I never presumed I would have any real happiness at all. I never expected that I would be able to share my life with someone I really loved, no matter how much I longed for it. That was unimaginable back then.\nAnd as I got older, I never expected that I would be blessed to meet the love of my life and be so loved by him. I never expected my parents to be as loving, accepting and respectful of me and Bob as they both were. Same from my sisters and brother. I never presumed I would be able to speak of my partner in the workplace or hold hands with him in the public park. All of these things that straight people can take for granted from the moment they start dating, are that much more of a gift for me, because I never expected them or felt entitled to them. These basic human needs, protected as rights for others, are still a gift to me, even though my own pursuit of happiness, life and liberty depend upon them.\nAnd so, most importantly, I still can\u2019t take this election for granted or my duty to vote for granted. I have friends\u2013too smart for their own good\u2013who are actually considering voting third party or not voting at all on principle, because of their differences or disappointment with both candidates on other issues. They take for granted that not voting will have no more affect on their own lives than voting would, but appear not to have considered the effect these elections could have on me and Bob.\nAnd there are also extended family members and friends who intend to vote for former governor Romney. I can\u2019t imagine voting for any candidate who I knew intended to limit any of their the civil rights, but they will vote for a candidate and his running mate who have promised to do so to Bob and me.\nAs in my youth in the 1960s and \u201970s, I still can\u2019t take for granted that anyone\u2013family, friends, or fellow citizens of this land of the free\u2013will have my health, my rights, my relationship, or my life in mind on Election Day. And I, once again, feel the same pain of second-class citizenship, lowered expectations, uncertainty, and vulnerability, that I\u2019ve known my whole life.\nTherefore, all I can ask of these friends and family, all I can hope, is that on Election Day, just before you pull the lever on the voting machine, or walk past the polling location in your neighborhood complacently, that you will imagine Bob and my faces. That you will remember your uncle, cousin, friend, whom you have cared about, bought Christmas gifts for, shared meals with, checked up on in emergencies and invited to your weddings, and think of how your vote can affect the quality of Bob and my life, the home that we share, and the rights that you are lucky enough to take for granted, that I will never take for granted, even if they are ever fully mine.",

    "text": "Walking With the Great Apes is a comprehensive, engaging 6 part series that explores the current status of and challenges facing the world\u2019s largest remaining primates in the wild.\nWalking in the footsteps of Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall, young biologist Holly Carroll travels with an experienced film crew to the remote jungles and rainforests of Africa and Indonesia to study these highly intelligent animals in their increasingly threatened natural habitats.\nIn the series, she meets with Goodall, as well as a variety of other dedicated people now working to study and protect the great apes. Her travels also bring her face-to-face with the poachers, animal smugglers and loggers who put the survival of the world\u2019s apes at risk. The tragedy facing most of the remaining apes is that they live in lands of never-ending turmoil, countries in the grip of corrupt or violent governments, as well as other social and environmental challenges.\nEach of the episodes explores in depth a different primate, including their habits, personalities, and challenges. The first episode provides an overview of all five types of primates and the threats they face. Close contact and interactions with these great apes shows how they differ from other primates, and highlights their often-surprising levels of intelligence.\n\"Very highly recommended. This is a beautiful series of intimate portraits and journeys through spectacular scenery to get to know the highly intelligent and curious great apes in their remote habitats in troubled African and Asian countries.\"\n\"Highly Recommended. The filmmakers pack a lot into this series resulting in the ideal educational film. The episodes are short, visually appealing, balanced, and fact-filled. Episode 1 serves as a great introduction to primate ecology and conservation and is appropriate to most ages.\"\n\"Entertaining and informative \u2014 also simultaneously sad and hopeful \u2014 gives viewers a sense of what needs to be done and what can be done to save these majestic animals from their extended kin, us.\"\n\"An extraordinary series, taking the viewer on an adventurous journey to visit our zoological next of kin \u2013 the great apes of Africa and Southeast Asia. Along the way, we meet some of the best known scientists and conservationists who have dedicated (and in some cases given) their lives to the cause, and witness thrilling encounters with the apes themselves.\"\n\"Showcases bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans in highly entertaining nuggets. The series is packed with interesting facts, and will inspire viewers to help conserve our majestic cousins.\"",

    "text": "Refurbished treadmills are becoming more popular. Because people are starting to realise that to get the best value you need to buy a quality treadmill no matter what your budget. New treadmills for sale can be expensive if we\u2019re talking high-quality treadmills. There are many who can not afford to buy a high-quality new treadmill. That\u2019s where refurbished treadmills come in. But what exactly are refurbished treadmills and where do they sit in the marketplace?\nRefurbished treadmills are normally 4 to 8 years old and should be from the higher quality range from that era of machine.\nPrice wise refurbished treadmills slot in between cheap low-quality new treadmills and high-quality new treadmills. You will normally get a much higher specked treadmill with better components like frames, motors, rollers and larger running belts and decks than a cheap low-end treadmill.\nSo sometimes it makes sense to spend less, get some treadmill experience in, and then upgrade to get the exact treadmill model you want with the features you need.\nSo many people in New Zealand make the mistake of spending a limited amount of money on a lower end treadmill and not really get good value from their treadmill purchase. Treadmills that are getting used daily are being scraped and being upgraded to a higher quality treadmill.\nIf you buy a better quality new treadmill to start with or buy a refurbished treadmill you\u2019ll end up having a much better experience. A refurbished quality treadmill is much cheaper to buy than a high-quality new treadmill. It may be a bit dearer than a cheap budget new treadmill but you will get a better machine.\nSo you may not need to buy new for your first treadmill anyway, and if you\u2019re on a limited budget refurbished treadmills are a good way to start.\nThat\u2019s where refurbished treadmills come in. There are risks in just going out to look for ordinarily used treadmills. You don\u2019t know what you are getting. If the motor breaks down the day after you buy it then it may become an expensive treadmill. I have a lot of people ringing me 2 to 3 weeks after they purchased a secondhand treadmill off trade-me saying it was in perfect condition. The fact is the secondhand treadmill was far from perfect.\nWhat wears out on a treadmill?\nThe most common fault is a worn running belt and deck. It\u2019s not something you can see as the damage can mostly be detected by attaching a meter to the motor a checking what it reads.\nA refurbished treadmill, although usually more expensive than a similar second-hand model, is a safer bet, especially in the long term.\nSo, back to your question, what is a refurbished treadmill?\nThere is a whole range of \u201ccheaper\u201d treadmills. They can be called refurbished treadmills, factory refurbished treadmills, remanufactured treadmills or just used or second-hand treadmills.\nLet\u2019s dispose of the last two first. Used and second-hand treadmills are generally just treadmills that someone has used and wants to sell. You buy them, you take all the risk. Unless you know exactly what to look for when buying a treadmill like this then stay clear. Cheap treadmills like this can certainly be, well, cheap. But risky.\nAnd the others? Generally, all the terms mean that the treadmills have been disassembled to some degree and rebuilt, usually with new parts to replace broken or worn out parts. The frame sandblasted, sometimes, and the treadmill resprayed, sometimes. However, there can be some differences.\nRemanufactured treadmills or refurbished treadmills means just that. Treadmills which have been remanufactured or refurbished as we have described above. It doesn\u2019t tell you WHO remanufactured or refurbished them. Was it the local bicycle mechanic who did it? Often you don\u2019t know.\nThis process should involve taking the treadmill apart, examining all the parts and replacing all broken, worn out or old parts. Before it is reassembled it should be sandblasted and repainted. It should look like a new treadmill, or at least very close to it.\n1. The age of the treadmill.\n2. Who is refurbishing or remanufacturing it?\n3. Most importantly, the warranty you get with it.\nWhy the warranty? Well if it\u2019s a great refurbished treadmill then they ought to recognise this with a great warranty.\nI have just been looking on the net at some refurbished treadmills at my favourite refurbished treadmills merchant. Certainly, amongst the refurbished treadmills there is a lower range to choose from than new, but you\u2019d expect that. But there are still plenty of choices. And expect a substantial saving off new price.\nSo if you\u2019re new to treadmills and looking for refurbished treadmills or any refurbished treadmills for that matter, then there are some good choices available at some substantial savings.\nAlthough treadmills are some of the most popular items of fitness equipment in New Zealand and the world, they don\u2019t appeal to everyone. Some people can find that they use a treadmill for a while and decide that they prefer some other form of exercise. Sometimes it not another piece of indoor exercise equipment, it\u2019s just that they prefer to exercise outdoors.\nBack to treadmill repair home page .",

    "text": "Constant reminders that African Americans were inferior to white people marked towns and cities in the first half of the 20th century. Signs labeled \u201ccolored,\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d were highly visible by design, meant to constrict freedom based on the color of one\u2019s skin. Heroically, many African American men and women refused to accept these labels, determined to prove their intelligence, strength, and fortitude by fighting for their right to fight. Ultimately, their battle focused on civil rights during and after World War II.\nMost people are familiar with the Tuskegee Airmen. They are legendary.\nIn the Museum\u2019s exhibit Fighting for the Right to Fight: African American Experiences During WWII, the exhibit centerpiece focuses on the Tuskegee Airmen, the famous Red Tails pilots whose incredible war exploits became a symbol of African-American participation in World War II. The Dallas Holocaust Museum/Center for Education and Tolerance opened the exhibit on September 7, 2017. Speakers included former Tuskegee Airmen Flight Officer Robert T. McDaniel, Mrs. Erma Bonner-Platte, widow of Tuskegee Airmen instructor Claude Platte Jr., and Dr. J. Todd Moye, Professor of History at the University of North Texas.\nDr. Moye moderated a panel between McDaniel and Bonner-Platte which he began by providing historical background on the discrimination African Americans faced when attempting to enlist and/or serve in the armed forces.\nSegregation, upheld by the landmark case Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), along with Jim Crow laws, restricted the civil liberties of African Americans in every sector of society, including the military. African Americans were rejected from serving in the Army Air Services during World War I. This racial discrimination fueled the NAACP and others to work for change in military policies.\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a presidential decree that allowed African Americans to join the war effort during World War II. After the decree, the U.S. Army Air Corps trained a limited number of black pilots in Tuskegee, Alabama. The 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group became known as the Tuskegee Airmen.\nFormer Tuskegee Airmen Flight Officer Robert T. McDaniel attended I.M. Terrell High School in Texas and was drafted into the armed services in 1943. He was later accepted into the U.S. Army Air Corps.\nMcDaniel\u2019s drive, intelligence, and skills led him to surpass the benchmarks for acceptance into the air force as established by the U.S. War Department. McDaniel and Bonner-Platte\u2019s husband, Claude Platte Jr., were two of the 922 pilots trained in Tuskegee, Alabama between 1941 and 1946.\nThe Tuskegee Airmen proved themselves to be some of the best pilots in the U.S. Army Air Forces. Their first-rate skills and abilities earned them the respect of other bomber crews who often requested them as escorts. The Tuskegee Airmen had a much better record than bombers flown by white pilots.\nThe accomplishments of the Tuskegee Airmen showed the world that African Americans deserved more recognition and respect than they had received at home. The end of the war reinvigorated their desire for equality and catalyzed the Civil Rights Movement.\nDuring the exhibit opening, a member of the audience asked McDaniel and Bonner-Platte what messages they might have for the next generation of students regarding their experiences during World War II.\n\u201cI want young people to know that they can do anything that any other person can do, with no exceptions, and that they shouldn\u2019t let anyone discourage them from any occupation that they desire to pursue,\u201d said McDaniel.\nBonner-Platte answered the question by recalling a story her husband had repeated many times. When he was a young boy, Platte looked in the air and saw an object flying overhead. He ran up to his father and asked what it was. His father explained it was an airplane, and the man he saw in it was a called a pilot. Platte knew immediately that that\u2019s what he wanted to be when he grew up.\nPlatte\u2019s father encouraged his son\u2019s passion for aviation by taking his family to Meacham field to watch the planes land and take off. Platte later found himself in Tuskegee in 1939 and joined the Tuskegee Airmen.\nThe tenacity and determination these men exhibited during a time of segregation, discrimination, and racial inequality serve as an incredible example of perseverance and inspiration for all ages.",

    "text": "Pursuing a career in biology can be immensely rewarding and exciting. Studying biology teaches us to ask questions, make observations, evaluate evidence, and solve problems. Biologists learn how living things work, how they interact with one another, and how they evolve. Their work increases our understanding about the natural world in which we live and helps us address issues of personal well being and worldwide concern, such as environmental depletion, threats to human health, and maintaining viable and abundant food supplies.\nCarleton University Biology graduates are continuously successful at gaining employment in industry, government, and academic sectors.\nThe degree program is designed to be a qualification in itself and many Carleton graduates take positions in government and industry directly upon graduation. The degree is also an entry point for various graduate (Master\u2019s and Doctorate) programs.\nHealth care: Biologists in health care may develop public health campaigns to defeat illnesses such as tuberculosis, AIDS, cancer, and heart disease. Others work to prevent the spread of rare, deadly diseases, such as the now infamous Ebola virus. Veterinarians tend to sick and injured animals, and doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health care professionals maintain the general health and well being of their patients.\nPrimary and secondary schools: Teaching younger students requires a general knowledge of science and skill at working with different kinds of learners. High school teachers often specialize in biology and teach other courses of personal interest.\nHow can I prepare for a career in biology?\nIf you are interested in becoming a biologist, there are some things you can do along the way to prepare yourself.\nExplore your university options. Deciding where to go to university and what to study can be a daunting task. Research schools of interest. Talk to your guidance counselor, as well as to admissions counselors, faculty, and current students at these schools. There are excellent programs at a wide range of institutions, from large research universities to small liberal arts universities.\nHave fun! While studies are important, remember to get out and enjoy yourself as well. Participate in any extracurricular activities of interest: a school club, a science fair, a sports team, or volunteer work. You\u2019ll learn teamwork while developing leadership and social skills, making you stand out not only as a future biologist but also as an individual.\nConsider how long you want to be in school. Most life science careers require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and often an advanced degree, such as a master\u2019s degree. Research jobs typically require a doctorate, which may take five or six years of intense and demanding training.\nAsk your professors about part-time jobs. Many professors hire student assistants to help with library, field, and laboratory research. Not only will you earn some money and experience, but you\u2019ll also develop a professional relationship with someone who can give you career advice and write letters of recommendation.\nFind summer internships. Internships are a good way to learn about a career, make contacts, and gain experience in biology. Some internships may provide opportunities to do an original research project\u2014a very rewarding experience that will show you how science works and get you thinking about graduate school.\nWhere are the best university biology programs?\nMost faculty members hold PhD degrees and have active, productive research programs. The faculty is an accurate representation of the diversity of biological disciplines: botanists, evolutionary biologists, zoologists, biochemists, cell biologists, ecologists, physiologists, taxonomists, and so on. Either the biology program contains faculty members in diverse fields, or the university has several individual departments that complement each other.\nCourses are taught by faculty members, not graduate students.\nThe institution has an active faculty advisor program and an active career advising/career development program.\nThe curriculum includes a variety of courses that provide a strong background in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and writing, while still allowing students to pursue their individual interests.\nWell-equipped libraries with Internet access to biology journals, and easily accessible computer labs for student use.\nFaculty welcome students into their research groups as part-time workers, interns, and research assistants.\nOpportunities are available for undergraduates to pursue independent research projects.\nThere are programs and centers that suit a student\u2019s particular interest, for example, a field station to study ecology, proximity to the coast or a marine station to study marine biology.\nRead about the Carleton Advantage.\nWhat is the job outlook for the future?\nJob growth is expected in a number of areas, biotechnology and molecular biology in particular. In addition, the number of openings in federal government agencies charged with managing natural resources, such as Environment Canada and Agriculture Canada, is expected to grow. These openings will become available as many senior-level biologists and life scientists retire in the coming years.\nA 2003 survey in conjunction with the Abbot and Langer Company found that biologists with less than one year experience have a starting salary of around $35,000 per year. Data from a 2003 US Bureau of Labor Statistics report show that the field of life sciences as a whole has a mean annual salary close to $55,000. As biologists gain more experience and education in their field, those in private industry may earn salaries of over $80,000, while those working in government, academia, and the nonprofit sector earn around $60,000 to $70,000. Those with over 30 years of experience have a median salary of around $103,000. Keep in mind that salaries may vary greatly depending on geographic location, job type, and experience and education.\nAs you can see, higher salaries are found in private research companies and government agencies, where you may have more job security, advancement opportunities, and independence in your work. While jobs in nonprofit groups or academic institutions may in general have lower salaries, many biologists find great personal reward in working for an organization that is affecting change and has an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration.\nCarleton Career Services is a valuable resource to all Carleton students and alumni and will provide career exploration information, resume writing tips, interview tips, job search tools, and many other resources.",

    "text": "Until recent years, Calvert County was a rural area with dusty narrow roads, acres of planted fields, and far from everything. Although Southern Maryland was the first part of the original thirteen colonies to be settled by Roman Catholics (as early as 1634), Catholicism in Calvert County had a long and difficult path to follow. By 1706 there were 3,611 people living in our county but only 48 were Catholics.\nFather Maurice B. Alexander, pastor of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Solomons, started our parish as a mission in the late 1920\u2019s. In 1937 our Church was built. Following Father Alexander\u2019s death in 1946, a succession of short term pastors served both Our Lady Star of the Sea and the Prince Frederick mission. In 1965, we became an independent parish with 100 families and Father Naughton as our first pastor.\nSt. John Vianney Parish has progressed from a mission church to a rapidly growing community requiring larger facilities. In 1990, we celebrated our twenty-fifth anniversary. Several years before then we became a tithing parish and through tithing we have witnessed many blessings and a strengthening of our growing faith. God has blessed us with much growth and change.\nThe son of a small farmer, Jean-Marie Vianney was born near Lyons, France on May 8, 1786. At age 20, he started his studies for the priesthood. During Lent in 1807, Jean-Marie received the sacrament of Confirmation. He chose the Confirmation name \"John Baptist\" after his favorite saint. Jean-Marie was ordained August 12, 1815.\nIn 1818, Jean-Marie was made the parish priest of Ars, a small sleepy village France. Today, Ars is known over the world for this priest, a \"model of goodness.\"\nFor more than thirty years, Ars was a place of pilgrimage for people from all over France. They came and waited two or three days to go to confession to the Cur\u00e9 . They went back home with new courage and hope.\nJean Marie Baptiste Vianney was the parish priest of Ars for forty-one years. He died on August 4, 1859. Eighty six years later he was canonized by Pius XI, and in 1929 he was declared the principal patron saint of parish priests throughout the world.\n1903 Rev. John McNamara was named pastor of St. Francis de Sales, Benedict. He served the areas of Benedict, Solomons, and Prince Frederick.\n1920 Rev. Maurice B. Alexander became the first pastor of Our Lady Star of the Sea, Solomons. He also celebrated Mass in Prince Frederick until 1938.\n1937 The cornerstone was laid for the new church in Prince Frederick under the patronage of St. John Vianney, Patron of Parish Priests.\n1938 Mass was celebrated for the first time in the new church.\n1965 Archbishop Patrick O\u2019Boyle designated St. John Vianney as a parish and appointed Father Joseph Naughton as the first pastor.\n1966 Present rectory was purchased.\n1979 Parish Center (Vianney Room) was built.\n1990 Parishioners observe the 25th Anniversary of the canonical establishment of St. John Vianney Parish.\n1993 New wing on Parish Center was built which contains the parish office, classrooms and a library. The entry foyer was capped with a square cupola to reflect the waterfront areas of our community. It is symbolic of the church\u2019s role in being a guiding light to those who live in the community.\n1995 The adult religious education program, Pathways, began.\n1996 Christian Beginnings, the parish pre-school, along with a playground was established. A new porch and arbor were added to the Church along with additions to the Church\u2019s Community Room including a handicapped bathroom and a kitchenette.\n1997 A Catholic cemetery was established on the Church grounds. The parish assisted with the establishment of a crisis pregnancy center, Birthright, and a homeless shelter, ECHO.\n2002 Dedication of new church.\n2006 Safe Nights program started.\n2007 Completed church basement build out.\n2008 Started Nicaragua housing program.\n2010 Parish became debt free.\n2011 Vianney Room renovation and expansion completed.\n2014 Expanded cemetery to area along Main Street with a second columbarium.",

This allows the Society to be giving back to the churches who allow them to ring there by ringing for Sunday evensong, and calling people to worship, which is after all the sole purpose of church bell ringing.\nPractice nights are well attended with 14 or 15 at each practice, along with a positive atmosphere which makes ringing a pleasure.\nAs well as achieving a decent standard of striking, the society is focused on allowing members to \u201chave a go\u201d at methods that they have wanted to try in a non-intimidating environment. This has already seen results with members making rapid progress on plain hunt, and others having the chance to ring Stedman and touches of Cambridge. The Society has already made its mark by coming 3rd in a local striking competition, and we plan to go on to do bigger and greater things!\nOur summer weekend away in 2011 to Thorpe Park and London went very well with a large group making the trip to the \"Big Smoke\" and especially enjoying ringing on the new bells at St Magnus. In 2012 we visited Alton Towers and rang at a few towers in Derbyshire.\nWith more exciting outings and events to happen in the pipeline, and always enjoyable practice nights, it seems Plymouth Youths is the place to be for young ringers! If any young people in the Plymouth area would like to join us, they are most welcome. We meet on the 1st and 3rd Sunday evening of the month at various towers so it is advisable to email first to find out where and when we are ringing.",

    "text": "Original article (Justice Named WBB Head Coach) on the Sam Houston State University\u2019s athletic website gobearkats.com.\nSam Houston State has named Ravon Justice as its 10th women\u2019s basketball head coach in the 48-year history of the program. Justice joins the Bearkats after two successful seasons as the head coach at Prairie View A&M, her first two years as a head coach.\nAs a head coach at Prairie View A&M, she helped resurrect and refocus the once prominent women\u2019s basketball program. In her first year, she had a school record five non-conference wins against teams from Conference USA, the Southland and the MEAC. Justice was able to lead the Panthers to an 11-2 home record in her first season along with coaching a second team all-SWAC selection and second team Box-To-Row All American selection in Alexus Parker.\nThis past season, the Panthers posted a 12-6 SWAC record, a five-game improvement from the season before, and missed earning a share of the league title by one game. She led the team to the SWAC semifinals for the first time in three seasons.\nPrior to coaching at PV, Justice was an assistant coach at the University of Houston. In Justice\u2019s first year at Houston in 2010-11, the Cougars enjoyed one of their finest seasons in program history, posting a 26-6 overall record and returning to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 2004-05 season.\nWith Justice\u2019s guidance, Houston point guard Porsche Landry earned Conference USA first team honors and became only the fourth player in Cougars\u2019 women\u2019s basketball histo\u00adry to tally more than 1,000 points and 300 assists during her career. Justice also made an immediate impact on the recruiting trail after taking over those duties following the 2010-11 sea\u00adson, as various recruiting services such as Dan Olson\u2019s Collegiate Girls Basketball Report (No. 22) and ESPN HoopGurlz (No. 39) ranked the early six-player class that signed in November of 2011 among the nation\u2019s top-40 recruiting hauls.\nJustice joined the University of Houston staff after five sea\u00adsons as an assistant at Houston Baptist. Before helping the Huskies\u2019 team transition from the NAIA to the NCAA\u2019s Division I classification, Justice was a part of the 2005-06 team that completed an undefeated run to the Red River Athletic Confer\u00adence\u2019s regular season and tournament championships. HBU repeated as tournament champions the following season.\nThe Huskies also made two trips to the NAIA Division I tournament during Justice\u2019s tenure with the team, including a trip to the quarterfinals in 2007.\nDuring her own collegiate playing career, Justice attended Nicholls for one year before transferring to Clarendon College. As a Lady Bulldog, she was named a junior college All-American in addition to receiving Western Junior College Athletic Conference Player of the Year honors.\nJustice earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology from USAO in 2004 and received her master\u2019s degree in liberal arts from Houston Baptist in 2009.",

    "text": "As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s never too early to be thinking about fantasy football. The more time spent doing research during the offseason, the more edge there is to be gained over your less-obsessed opponents \u2013 who are lazy and weak, whose minds will atrophy in the offseason, wasting precious time and energy preoccupied by trivial thoughts of work and family, or even worse, sports other than football.\nFor the true fantasy football addicts amongst us, below you will find my \u201cnever too early\u201d 2019 tiered rankings for the tight end position with accompanying analysis. We already tackled the quarterback, running back, and wide receiver positions.\nThis information is also now actionable, thanks to best ball leagues with drafts taking place today on DRAFT.com and BestBall10s.com.\nOwning any one of the \u201cbig three\u201d tight ends offered you a massive edge over your opponents in 2018. I went more in-depth on these players here.\nFor all of the reasons outlined here, I think Henry has the best chances of joining the Tier 1 tight ends and turning the \u201cbig three\u201d into a \u201cbig four.\u201d He rightfully stands in a tier all his own.\nI\u2019d bet Howard becomes a fantasy superstar at some point in his career. Across the PFF era (2007-2018), Howard\u2019s 2018 season ranked top-15 in yards per route run by a tight end. Howard leads all tight ends in yards per target (11.5) over the past two seasons, and, in 2018, ranked sixth at the position in fantasy points per game (12.1). Still, concerns involve Cameron Brate\u2019s presence and new head coach Bruce Arian\u2019s constrained usage of tight ends throughout his career. \u2026 Engram has less upside than Howard but is less risky as well. Over the past two seasons, Engram ranks fifth at the position in fantasy points per game (11.1).\nWalker and Olsen are deserving of injury discounts. Walker played on just 39 snaps in 2018 before suffering a season-ending injury but finished (across the previous four seasons) sixth, sixth, third, and seventh among tight ends in fantasy points per game. Olsen missed time with a fractured foot in 2017 and then re-fractured it and played through that injury for most of the 2018 season. He finished top-five in fantasy points across each of the previous three seasons. It seems unlikely at the moment, but there is a risk he retires before the start of the season. \u2026 If Gronkowski announces he\u2019s back for another year, I\u2019d be fine moving him up to Tier 2, but I think it\u2019s more likely than not he\u2019ll announce his retirement sometime soon. That said, even if he\u2019s back for another year, Gronkowski seemed a shell of his former self in 2018, recording career lows (outside of his rookie season) in fantasy points per game (10.6) and PFF grade.\nAssume a massive gap between Tier 1 and Tier 2, and then a larger gap between Tier 2 and Tier 3, and then an even bigger gap between Tier 3 and Tier 4. The gap between Tier 4 and Tier 5 is a jump across the Grand Canyon in comparison to any of the other tiers. Njoku is a young player (22 years old) with plenty of talent, though we\u2019ve yet to really see that talent materialize on the field. In 2018, he led the position in drops (8), but also ranked fifth in routes run (490), seventh in targets (83), and eighth in receiving yards (639). I think it\u2019s likely he takes a step forward in Year 3. \u2026 Ebron\u2019s production was terrific in 2018, but he was also out-snapped (331 to 164) and out-targeted (32 to 22) by a banged-up Jack Doyle in games both were active. \u2026 Graham played the near-entirety of the 2018 season with knee and/or thumb injuries, and (as a result) didn\u2019t play well, but is still tethered to a top-three quarterback and top-five NFL offense.\nUnlike the other tiers, there isn\u2019t much of a gap between Tier 5 and Tier 6. Cook finished fifth at the position in fantasy points per game (12.1), but it was far and away the best fantasy season of his 10-year career and is an unrestricted free agent this year. \u2026 Reed was once a top-three fantasy tight end whenever he was on the field (though that wasn\u2019t often), but the 2018 iteration of Reed looked nothing like the older version. \u2026 Doyle is tricky for me. I may actually end up swapping him and Ebron, but for now I\u2019ll have to yield to the Indianapolis tight end who stayed healthy and scored more points.",

    "text": "Teachers and scholars at the Vassal Lane Upper School celebrated summer reading as a community on Friday, September 7th.\nLast spring, every faculty member at Vassal Lane selected one book to read during the summer, and the staff created a Faculty Book List to share with incoming scholars. Each scholar was required to read one book from the Vassal Lane Faculty Book List and to return back to school in September ready to discuss the book in a small book group.\nOn the first Friday of the school year, teachers and scholars met and discussed their books in more than forty small book groups. Book groups met outside on the field behind the school on a beautiful, sunny afternoon.\nOne Vassal Lane scholar noted that students made their book selections both based on interest in the book and on their connections with particular teachers. Book groups had a mix of sixth, seventh, and eighth grade scholars, giving everyone a chance to get to know each other a little better outside of their regular classroom schedules and groupings.\nThe most popular books on the Faculty Book List were The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie, Every Day by David Leviathan, and Wonder by R.J. Palatio. In addition, a large number of scholars enjoyed two of the nonfiction titles on the Faculty Book List: A Black Hole is NOT a Hole by Carolyn DeCristofano and Race: A History Beyond Black and White by Marc Aronson.\nFaculty members and scholars are looking forward to the next opportunity to share books together as Vassal Lane continues to strengthen and celebrate its growing community of readers.",

    "text": "A very warm good morning to the respected teachers and my dear friends gathered here. Today we are gathered here to celebrate this auspicious occasion of Independence day on 15th of August. We celebrate this day with lots of enthusiasm and joy every year because our country got freedom at this day in 1947 from the British rule. We are here to celebrate nth number of independence day. It is great and most significant day for all Indians. People of India had suffered cruel behavior of Britishers for many years. Today we have freedom in almost all fields such as education, sports, transportation, business, etc just because of the years of struggle of our forefathers. Before 1947, people were not so free even they were restricted to have rights on their own body and mind. They were slave of Britishers and forced to follow all the orders of them. Today we are free to do anything because of the great Indian leaders who struggled hard for many years to get freedom against British rule.\nIndependence day is celebrated all over India with much pleasure. This day is of great importance to all Indian citizens as it gives us opportunity to remember all those freedom fighters who had sacrificed their lives just for giving us a beautiful and peaceful life. Earlier to the independence, people were not allowed to get education, eat healthy food and live normal life like us. We should be grateful to those events responsible for the freedom in India. Indians were treated more badly than slaves by the Britishers just to fulfill their meaningless orders.\nSome of the great freedom fighters of India are Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhiji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpath Ray, Bhagat Singh, Khudi Ram Bose and Chandra Sekhar Azad. They were famous patriots who struggled hard for the freedom of India till the end of their life. We cannot imagine that horrible moment struggled by our forefathers. Now, after many years of independence our country is on the right track of development. Today our country is a well established democratic country all over the world. Gandhiji was great leader who taught us about effective way of freedom like ahimsa and sathyagraha methods. Gandhi dreamed of an independent India with the non violence and peace.\nIndia is our mother country and we are its citizens. We should always be ready to save it from the bad people. It is our responsibility to lead our country ahead and make it a best country of the world.\nVery good morning to the honorable Chief Guest of the day, respected teachers, parents and my all dear friends. I wish you all a very Happy Independence Day. We all know the reason of get together here in such a big crowd. We all are excited celebrating this great day in such an excellent manner. We are gathered here to celebrate nth independence day of our nation. First of all we hoist our honorable national flag then give a salute to all the heroic deeds of the freedom fighters. I am feeling so proud to be an Indian citizen. I have such a great chance to give a speech on the Independence Day in front of you all. I would like to say thanks to my respected class teacher that she has given me an opportunity to share my views with you all about the freedom of India.\nA very good morning to the excellencies, respected teachers and my dear colleagues. We are gathered here to celebrate nth Independence day. I am very happy to speech here on this great occasion. I am very grateful to my class teacher to give me such a special opportunity to say my views on the independence day of my country. At this special occasion of independence day I would like to speech on the India\u2019s struggle for getting freedom from the British rule.\nLong years ago, great Indian leaders were made a tryst with the destiny to give us a free and peaceful country by sacrificing their comfort of life. Today we are gathered here to celebrate independence day without any fear and having happy face just because of our brave forefathers. We cannot imagine that how the moment was critical at that time. We have nothing to give our forefathers in return for their precious hard works and sacrifices. We can only remember them and their deeds and make a heartily salute while celebrating the national events. They would always be in our hearts. After the independence India get new birth with happy face of all Indian citizens.\nIndia got independence on 15th of August in 1947 from the clutches of British rule. Indian people all over the country celebrate this national festival annually with lots of joy and enthusiasm. It was great day for all the Indian citizens when India\u2019s tricolor flag was unfolded by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, at the Red Fort, Delhi.\nA huge celebration takes place in New Delhi at Rajpath every year where national anthem is sung after the flag hoisting by prime minster. Together with the national anthem a salute through 21 guns firing and showering of flowers through helicopter is given to the national flag. Independence day is a national holiday however everyone celebrate this from their own places by hosting the flags in schools, offices or society. We should feel proud to be an Indian and try our best to save the honor of our country.",

    "text": "You may have heard about \u201cblack hat\u201d SEO tactics. Essentially, these tactics take advantage of the traditional use of keywords and key phrases and warps them through different techniques that are often called \u201ckeyword stuffing\u201d. In essence, black hat techniques violate the spirit in of the current system.\nFor several years Google has been focusing much of their effort to eliminating black hat SEO techniques. With so much literature pouring out about how such tricks are being dealt with, it may surprise you to know that not only are black hat SEO still around, but they are still alive and working for thousands of online business owners this year.\nThe reason why black hat tactics are still being used is a simple one. They still generate a great deal of sales. You see it in the blogs, forums and other places where marketers who use these techniques tell the world that sales are still pouring into their websites. Even the efforts of the vaunted Google Penguin which highlights the online businesses that use such tactics, the money they generate keeps pouring in not because of their ranking, but because every time such tactics get used the sales increase or the leads come in by the bushel.\nAmazingly enough, there are still many websites using black hat techniques that still have high rankings even with their bad profiles. The new algorithms sported by Google are still not good enough to catch all of these businesses. For the past year, Google has focused the efforts of their spam team and associated contractors to check forums used by black hat online business and other places in order to see what SEO tactics they are using and eliminate them. This is one reason why the blog networks which was a haven for black hat businesses was caught.\nHowever, despite all of their efforts and Google changing their algorithms to throw off these black hat tactics, it still is not enough. Negative SEO is still around although Google incorporated RankBrain and black hat SEO, for all of its connotations, still works in selling products. You can always use disavow links tool to ignore bad links pointing to your website.\nWhy exactly is a webpage that contains bad backlinks can still be ranked so highly in today\u2019s internet world?\nThere is no simple answer to that question since there are many reasons why it continues to be true.\nUnfortunately, too many online business owners who attempt black hat tactics do so poorly and get caught easily. One of blackhat SEO is called wikipedia injection. As soon as those large SEO websites post an article, right away they inject their link on wikipedia to keep their ranking stable. Just check seo related posts on wikipedia, there are a lot of websites from small to large ones injected their links there. Wikipedia\u2019s consultants are not doing their job right to remove them. so these black hat seo still is a trend among SEOs. These SEO companies keep monitoring their links on wikipedia so as soon as one removes their links, they replace them.\nOne example is if you have a forum or guest blog, your first instinct would be to spread that to the most popular forums or WordPress commenting sections because all WordPress bloggers will see your ad when they want to publish their articles. This is how many marketers land a large number of sales in a single night I am talking about spreading over 2 million or more sites. There are more ways of landing sales. I would recommend using Google Adwords PPC and Facebook advertising. Because you\u2019re playing your cards right and if you use the right PPC ad management strategies, you will generate leads and sales. As forum posting, I am not suggesting to use this blackhat tactic because it will hurt your website\u2019s ranking, and it won\u2019t work but from sales perspective large niche forum posting helps with sales if it is done right. Blog commenting is another way of driving in sales, but if you want to use it for black hat SEO then this also won\u2019t help with ranking anymore.\nBottom line, black hat SEO can get your website banned and it\u2019s not worth it. Remember! It\u2019s not about ranking, its about getting more targeted people see your products or services and buy from you. This is why you should use whitehat SEO, paid advertisement and social media marketing strategies. If you run an ecommerce website, use influencer marketing strategies to get more love to your products and services.",

    "text": "Why have you been at Arnold Clark for 10 years?I started part time when I was at university. Then, I decided to buy a house the minute I turned 18 and realised I needed a bit more money. I supported myself through uni and decided to stay on with Arnold Clark because I liked the people and the atmosphere and I could see that there was plenty of room for me to develop.\nWhat was your first job in the automotive industry? At the time, I did a bit of everything. The warehousing side of things, goods in, goods out, quality control, driving \u2013 I was a van coordinator for a while as well, overseeing 25 drivers. I also worked in the office dealing with Ford customers over the phone.\nWhat does your current role involve?I\u2019ve been working towards building a new training platform for all Parts staff, where I really want them to continue training, not because they have to but because they want to; knowing that they can better themselves. There\u2019s nothing worse than being on a course and you just sit there falling asleep waiting to leave and the highlight of it is getting your lunch! I don\u2019t want it to be like that for my team. Essentially, it\u2019s writing and delivering training courses. Creating new materials. Getting out and about, talking to people, seeing what they\u2019re doing, what they need, and what the business needs are and making it all go hand in hand.\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your job?Being patient, to be honest. That\u2019s not just in the current role, but me in general. I like to get stuck into everything that I do and do it well. Understanding that other people and processes might not move at the speed that I\u2019d like but I know in the end we get there, one way or another. To a degree that\u2019s probably been part of my earlier days when I first became a Parts manager and managing my own frustrations, so definitely one of my earlier challenges as well.\nWould you recommend working at Arnold Clark to others?Yes, naturally. Once you realise the width, depth and scale of the company, then you\u2019ve got a career for life, doing whatever you want to do. A lot of people don\u2019t know the truth about the motor trade. They think it\u2019s a dirty, male-orientated, hands-on environment, whereas in actual fact it\u2019s very business orientated, very financial and a lot of IT skills are needed. It also involves a lot of customer-facing work. If there was better awareness of it, a lot more people will realise there\u2019s a great career to be had.",

    "text": "With so little in weight, the TomTom Rider comes with a waterproof exterior and features Bluetooth capability that makes for convenient hands-free phone calls and data-exchange. With the BlueTooth connection capability, you can also have directions delivered to your helmet or headset. It does come with a USB 2.0 to help connect to a computer, and has internal memory although it doesn\u2019t come with an SD card slot. The 4.3-Inch screen is not only glove-friendly but is one of the multi-touch variety. The waterproof screen also provides for high visibility in the sunlight.\nThe unit comes loaded with free \u2018Lifetime\u2019 maps for the UK, Ireland and 45 European countries, with an option of updating them throughout the year. The free lifetime updates help ensure that you have the latest routes present on your sat nav. A fitting kit is available that works on a number of bikes. There is a Winding Roads feature that enables you select the route with the most curves in case an adrenaline rush is what you seek!\nMuch as the Rider can be directly wired into the bike\u2019s battery, this is a very long process that requires routing the wiring and so on. Since a fitting kit is provided, in case you do change bikes often, then you can multiple positioning points. The kit however isn\u2019t quite as complete as some of its rivals though, it misses on a few connectors that enlarge fitment options. Putting that aside however, it does come with enough to fit the Rider at least someplace usable, if not entirely aligned.\nYou can touch the sat nav\u2019s screen with any kind of glove, inclusive of the thickest and it will still work. You may however notice that a winter glove may just require a lot more prodding than its light counterparts, but the ultimately, the job is done. A number of options are available on the menu to make for a pleasant ride to your destination. You can input an address via a full or partial address or you can input it by post code.\nWith the PC Route Management via Tire feature, you are in position to search and create routes on your computer and then proceed to upload the same onto your sat nav.\nAt the end of the day, the TomTom Rider is an amazing sat-nav unit for a motorcyclist, and it works tremendously well , making it an ideal choice to look into in terms of the numerous satellite navigation units on the market. Unfortunately, there are drawbacks to owning this gadget some of which include; coming with no mount which means that you have to purchase it separately in case you need it. In addition, there is no car charger attached to this unit, which again means that you have to purchase one separately.\nI wish the new sat nav had the protruding screen shade, its a cool feature!",

    "text": "I have owned a Pyranha Traveller 15 in Royalite since about 1998. I bought it at a time when I was starting to get bored with my k k and wanted something that I could travel in a more leisurely manner with and carry more picnic food/camping gear and also take my dog with me.\nIn the initial years as I learnt to paddle in straighter lines it suffered very little damage even on white water as being light and manoeuvrable I was able to use my k k experience to throw it around reasonably well.\nHowever in the last few years I have tried ever more demanding waters and this resulted in September with me severely rattling the tail on a river in Scotland and subsequent inspection showed the start of several splits. It did not stop the canoe from being gaffer-taped up and used for another two days but I was being careful.\nOn my return to the south I purchased a We-No-Nah Prospector 15 which is a better boat for my type of paddling (and yes I have split the tail on that one too) but the Pyranha is a lovely boat and will last for years yet for myself and friends/family so it deserved a skid plate and some TLC.\nAs I said the Pyranha had a split \u2013 well several really.\nI was advised by Dave Crooks at Endless River \u2013 guess whose Skid Plate kit I used?? \u2013 to drill the ends of the splits to stop them running further as the hull flexed in future use.\nI used a small grinder to explore the cracks.\nI then ground off the very flaky pieces of outer plastic shell but tried to avoid getting into the foam base or taking too much of the unstuck plastic flaps off. I decided that dabbing some resin under the flaps would help stick them down.\nBut so what, I could see it! The line is just below the finger. I then sanded the hull within the lined area and on it using some non-clogging 3M sandpaper. I gave it a good rub all over making sure that I did up and down strokes, across strokes and round in circles movements for good measure \u2013 in fact everything that you would not want to do to wood \u2013 in order to make sure that I had a good surface to key the resin on to. I wiped down the hull with cloth and then used \u2018vanilla\u2019 flavoured nail polish remover from Boots \u2013 plenty left if you want some \u2013 as that was the only type of Acetone that I could find in town to finish with.\nI also cut some darts into the edge of the material so that it would fold a little easier around the curve of the stem. This had worked well on the We-No-Nah but was probably not necessary on this boat as the hull is not so finely proportioned.\nIt may assist if you have some help in doing the job if only for moral support!!\nI had seen a few other boats with resin runs and so I decided to mask mine off with tape.\nI then decided not to follow the instructions about using cardboard to wet out the patch. I had heard from several sources that an Endless River kit would not have enough resin \u2013 vehemently denied by Dave and Carolyn \u2013 but I was not taking the risk. I wet my patch on top of the boat working on the principle that any run off would only go on the place I wanted it anyway.\nAfter wetting the one side of the patch and slipping some gel in the flaps of loose plastic, I flipped the patch and wetted out the other side keeping a close watch on the time as the resin is curing once the hardener is mixed in. I then applied three longitudinal layers of cling film (this is something that there is plenty of!) and using a beer can started rolling out some air bubbles and making sure that the patch was smooth. In the photo you can see that one side is yellowier (unrolled) and the other side looks greener. A small fibre glassing roller (the sort with discs) would have been better on the wetted patch before the cling film but I could not find one for sale.\nAt this stage in future I will remove the masking tape and bags as it might be easier than after the resin has hardened.\nI then wrapped the end of the canoe in cling film giving it tight laminations and went off to clean the equipment and drink the beer!\nI did not turn my boat over as suggested in the instructions but without the masking tape and bags I would do.\nI am quite pleased with the finished result. It has not been on the water yet but the We-No-Nah has been scraped down rock several times and is standing up to the job well.\nNext time I will be more careful when I stir the resin and hardener as I feel I put too many air bubbles in the mix. Otherwise I am very happy with my result.\nI am sure there is more to be said but the instructions in the bucket from Endless River (plus nearly everything you need and there was sufficient resin) cover most things like perhaps wanting your patch higher up the stem of the front of the canoe (I have only patched my sterns so one kit did both boats) and the usual Health and Safety advice.",

    "text": "Objectives To develop and validate a values clarification tool, the Short Graphic Values History Tool (GVHT), designed to support person-centred decision making during serious illness.\nMethods The development phase included input from experts and laypersons and assessed acceptability with patients/family members. In the validation phase, we recruited additional participants into a before\u2013after study. Our primary validation hypothesis was that the tool would reduce scores on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) at 1\u20132 weeks of follow-up. Our secondary validation hypotheses were that the tool would improve values clarity (reduce scores) more than other DCS subscales and increase engagement in advance care planning (ACP) processes related to identification and discussion of one\u2019s values.\nResults In the development phase, the tool received positive overall ratings from 22 patients/family members in hospital (mean score 4.3; 1=very\u2009poor; 5=very\u2009good) and family practice (mean score 4.5) settings. In the validation phase, we enrolled 157 patients (mean age 71.8 years) from family practice, cancer clinic and hospital settings. After tool completion, decisional conflict decreased (\u22126.7 points, 95%\u2009CI \u221211.1 to \u22122.3, p=0.003; 0\u2013100 scale; N=100), with the most improvement seen in the values clarity subscale (\u221210.0 points, 95%\u2009CI \u221217.3 to \u22122.7, p=0.008; N=100), and the ACP-Values process score increased (+0.4 points, 95%\u2009CI 0.2 to 0.6, p=0.001; 1\u20135 scale; N=61).\nConclusions The Short GVHT is acceptable to end users and has some measure of validity. Further study to evaluate its impact on decision making during serious illness is warranted.\nContributors All authors contributed to the design of the work, or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data.

    "text": "The St. Louis Fed\u2019s Financial Stress Index (STLFSI) is one index that is supposed to measure stress in the financial system. Its reading as of the January 25, 2018 update (reflecting data through January 19, 2018) is -1.463.\nThis entry was posted in Economic Forecasts and tagged ANFCI, economic indicators, NFCI on January 31, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nWhile the concept of Americans\u2019 incomes can be defined in a number of ways, many prominent measures continue to show disconcerting trends.\nOne prominent measure is the Employment Cost Index (ECI).\nThe Employment Cost Index (ECI) is a quarterly measure of the change in the price of labor, defined as compensation per employee hour worked. Closely watched by many economists, the ECI is an indicator of cost pressures within companies that could lead to price inflation for finished goods and services. The index measures changes in the cost of compensation not only for wages and salaries, but also for an extensive list of benefits. As a fixed-weight, or Laspeyres, index, the ECI controls for changes occurring over time in the industrial-occupational composition of employment.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged Household Income on January 31, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nI found President Trump\u2019s State of the Union Address last night (January 30, 2018) to contain some noteworthy comments. While I could comment extensively on many parts of the speech, for now I will indicate excerpts that I found most relevant with regard to the economic situation, and may comment upon them at a future point. I am highlighting these excerpts for many reasons; it should be noted that I do not necessarily agree with any or all of them.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged President Trump on January 31, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with the methodologies employed or the probabilities of impending economic weakness as depicted by these and other estimates, I do believe that the results of these models and estimates should be monitored.\nThis index measures the probability that the U.S. economy was in a recession during the indicated quarter. It is based on a mathematical description of the way that recessions differ from expansions. The index corresponds to the probability (measured in percent) that the underlying true economic regime is one of recession based on the available data. Whereas the NBER business cycle dates are based on a subjective assessment of a variety of indicators that may not be released until several years after the event , this index is entirely mechanical, is based solely on currently available GDP data and is reported every quarter. Due to the possibility of data revisions and the challenges in accurately identifying the business cycle phase, the index is calculated for the quarter just preceding the most recently available GDP numbers. Once the index is calculated for that quarter, it is never subsequently revised. The value at every date was inferred using only data that were available one quarter after that date and as those data were reported at the time.\nAdditional reference sources for this index and its construction can be seen in the Econbrowser post of February 14, 2016 titled \u201cRecession probabilities\u201d as well as on the \u201cThe Econbrowser Recession Indicator Index\u201d page.\nThis entry was posted in Economic Forecasts and tagged economic indicators on January 30, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged economic indicators on January 26, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nI have written extensively about U.S. interest rates and their importance. Rising interest rates have substantial ramifications for many aspects of the current-day economy. My commentaries with regard to interest rates and the bond bubble are largely found under the \u201cbond bubble\u201d tag. From an intervention perspective commentary is found under the \u201cIntervention\u201d category.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged 10-year Treasury yields on January 26, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nThis entry was posted in Stock Market and tagged VIX on January 25, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.\nOn this site numerous highly problematical issues concerning the U.S. economy and financial system have been discussed.\nOf key importance is the resulting level of risk and future implications.\nAs discussed in the September 29, 2017 post (\u201cProblematical Aspects Of Today\u2019s Financial System\u201c) the almost universal opinion is that the financial system is strong, in (large) part due to various reforms enacted since the Financial Crisis.\nHowever, there are many reasons to believe that this widely-held assessment is incorrect. At this time, due to many problematical areas, from an \u201call things considered\u201d basis I would assess the overall level of embedded peril to far exceed that previously experienced in the United States, including the level in existence prior to and during the Great Depression.\nWhile no one likes to contemplate a future rife with economic adversity, the resolution of the problematical issues in the economy and financial system will lead to what I have previously referred to as a \u201cSuper Depression,\u201d i.e. a severe economic depression characterized by difficult-to-solve problems.\nThis entry was posted in Depression on January 25, 2018 by Ted Kavadas.",

    "text": "Horror author and game designer Richard Dansky (Firefly Rain, Worlds of Their Own) has offered up a new monster for the Halloween Horror collection here at Flames Rising.\nThe House Spider does not feed on blood, or flesh, or anything so messy and gory as that. It lives in the dwelling places of the timid, the fearful, the cluttered and the cautious. It finds them by their tell-tale signs, their overloaded bookshelves and their disorganized collections, their piles of papers and dimly lit rooms, and there it settles, invisibly. In olden days, many lived in reading rooms, on top of green-shaded desk lamps or in the rare empty spaces on bookshelves. These days, they settle more beneath the computer desk, or near the television, or in amongst the video game consoles and their surrounding debris.\nHouse Spiders are, to most, invisible. They make themselves known, slowly, by the effects of their presence. A house burdened with one feels stuffy. Oppressive. Close, even. And yet the denizens, the ones who invited the House Spider in without even knowing it, find themselves ever more reluctant to leave it.\nIt\u2019s not their fault, of course; it\u2019s the House Spider\u2019s. Each day, it attaches another invisibly glistening thread to their backs, one that only stretches so far. To go beyond the tether is to invite unease, gradually shading into discomfort, nervousness, and ultimately, outright terror. Soon the victim begins making excuses not to go outside; canceling engagements, refusing invitations, even calling for delivery rather than set out on the simplest chores. All the while, the House Spider feeds on their ambition, on their spirit and energy. It draws this out of them, bit by bit, line by line, thread by thread.\nAnd when it has attached enough threads to them, it reels them in.\nIt doesn\u2019t kill them, oh no. It never does that. It just keeps them, and tends them, and never, ever lets them go.\nRichard Dansky is an author, game writer, and game designer. The author of five novels, including the critically acclaimed Firefly Rain, he serves as the Manager of Design for Red Storm Entertainment and the Central Clancy Writer for Ubisoft. A veteran of the original World of Darkness, Richard worked on well over a hundred books for White Wolf. He\u2019s also contributed to video games ranging from Cold Fear to Splinter Cell: Double Agent, and is a member of the Advisory Board of the Austin Game Developers\u2019 Conference. You can find Richard online at www.richarddansky.com.\nJeff Preston is a Freelance Illustrator who has been doing concept art and quality interior art and a few covers since the early 21st century. His first gig was for Key20 for a Halloween Special in 2002 with a deadline of four hours. Since then, Jeff has been producing art under deadlines consistently, building a reputation as the go-to guy for artwork to order, with no guff, and always on-time!\nVisit www.team-preston.com for a look at his gallery and upcoming projects.\nVery poignant, Richard. I like.\nGlad you liked it, folks!",

Emails obtained by the Huffington Post show the AFP\u2019s directors working to \u201cmoderate\u201d their message to obtain broader appeal.\nJohnson claims to have personally answered hundreds of replies to the robocalls, which \u201cwere surprisingly favorable to Donald Trump.

Trump is also a rampant xenophobe, who has threatened to deport 11 million immigrants and ban all Muslims from this country. Donald Trump is a fascist authoritarian, and whether or not he publicly denounces white supremacist groups, his actions show he is aligned with their ideas and clearly the groups also believe that to be the case.

Its unique designation is meant to protect this wild forest land while giving local groups a say in the land\u2019s management, and is a testament to the passion that outdoor enthusiasts have for this Ponderosa Pine-filled valley. Nestled between Wenatchee National Forest and farmland, Teanaway is an oasis for rare wolf packs, wildflowers, and spotted owls. We at Northwest Trail Runs are excited to invite you to this sunny valley, to a truly wild trail run, and catch a peek of Mt. Stuart along the way.\nThis event is part of the Half Marathon Trail Series, and runners in the Half Marathon distance will earn points toward their series standing. You can read more below or on the Half Marathon Trail Series page.\nUse the red registration button on the left to register for multiple Half Marathon Trail Series events at once. Register for two races to get a 5% discount on your entry fees, three races to get a 10% discount, and four or more races to get a 15% entry fee discount. The green button on the right links to registration just for this race.\nOnline pre-registration closes Friday, May 31 at 11:59pm.\nThe course follows primarily dirt logging roads of various ages, as well as some smaller trails through scattered forest, a few meadows, and past sandstone slabs. At times you can catch a peek into neighboring valleys. There is moderate elevation gain, as is listed below.\nThe half-marathon course is one large loop. Those running the 5k and 10k will each follow the half-marathon loop, but with a well-signed shortcut for each of the shorter distances, while marathoners will complete the half-marathon loop twice.\nAid stations offer water, electrolyte drink, and some carbohydrate-rich or salty foods, such as cookies, pieces of energy bar, gels, chews, chips, bagel, fruity candy, fig bars, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and/or bananas.\nThe start, finish, and registration area is located on W Fork Teanaway Road, just past the split with Teanaway Road Middle Fork (stay left to keep on W Fork Teanaway Road). There is a gravel parking lot here; please be mindful to park efficiently next to other cars; don\u2019t leave wide gaps between you and other parked cars.\nA Discover Pass is required to park & camp inside the Teanaway Community Forest. One day passes are NOT sold on-site, therefore you must pre-purchase your pass ahead of time. Click here for a list of locations where you can buy your pass ahead of time. The Sportland Mini Mart Inc. on 4400 Bullfrog Rd in Cle Elum is the closest location to the start and finish that sells Discover Passes.\nBe prepared to not have cell reception while you\u2019re approaching the venue! You may want to print directions.\nCome a day early and enjoy exploring more of the Teanaway at The Teanaway Navigation Race! Offering an hour of free beginner training, and 2-hour, 4-hour, and 8-hour race options, you make it a weekend full of adventure!\nMake it a beautiful and leisurely weekend by camping at West Fork Teanaway Campground, less than a mile from the start! This is a free campground with pit toilets and no running water or power, but you will need a Discover Pass to camp here (see details under Driving Directions & Parking above.) There are not designated camping spots, just a lot of flat, open space for you to pitch your tent. West Fork Teanaway Campground (showing as \u201cTeanaway Campground\u201d on Google Maps) was formerly operated by American Forest Resources and was recently transferred to the state within the new Teanaway Community Forest designation.\nWest Fork Teanaway Campground is very large, with tons of space to pitch a tent, and should not fill. However, in the unlikely event that it does fill, you can camp at Eagle Valley, on the south side of I-90, or try one of the other campgrounds in the Teanaway Valley, Indian Camp or Twenty-nine Pines.\nIf you prefer warmer and softer accommodations, Cle Elum is just a 30-minute drive from the start, and offers numerous hotel options.\nTech and cotton T-shirts with new custom artwork for The Teanaway Trail Run are available for purchase with online registration and can be picked up onsite at the event.\nThe tech T-shirt is Carolina Blue with a dark blue print, and the cotton T-shirt is a sunny (like the Teanaway Valley) Cornsilk Yellow color with a warm brown print.\nTeanaway apparel will not be available for purchase on event-day. There will be our usual Northwest Trail Runs series apparel available, with payment in cash only.\nThe trails will be open to other users during the event, including pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians (horseback riders). Please be courteous. Horses have the right of way. If you encounter a horse in your path, stop running and talk to the rider. You will probably need to step to the side of the trail to let the horse pass, but sometimes the rider will tell you it is okay for you to walk past. The amount of trail traffic will depend upon the weather.\nParticipants are responsible for their own safety while participating, and the organizers are neither qualified nor equipped to render medical care in the event of a serious injury. In case of an emergency, call 9-1-1. You are encouraged to bring a cell phone with you as a safety precaution, if you wish.\nWhere the trails are narrow, please let other participants pass you if they want to get by. It is a passing runner\u2019s job to tell the person in front that they wish to pass.\nIf you are wearing headphones during the event, please keep the volume low so that you can hear runners behind you. Be especially mindful that runners may be asking you to step aside so they may pass.\nOur events are USATF sanctioned and subject to USATF policies, and so dogs are not allowed to accompany runners on the course.\nOur website was built by Y-Designs, a Seattle-based web design company.",

    "text": "7 Senses in CI begins this Sunday!\n7 Senses of Contact Improvisation- at Studio Azul, Berkeley, Ca.\nIdiomatics of Contact Improv meets Exploratory Release Technique and other stuff. Post modern dance techniques broken down slowly with repetition. Expanding vocabulary of physics in contact, improvising with movement score/s -concepts to play with in solo or in contact with others. Returning to neutral. Integrating physical, emotional, mental.\nMoving into the Spring Equinox, we\u2019ll gain our equilibrium from a fear-inducing government and focus on developing a heightened awareness of the spidey senses during Women\u2019s history month.\n***All genders welcome-(feminists only of course) ***All Levels- (Beginners are welcome).\nIf Jane Austin had contact improvisation, it would have all made sense!\n(Sense and Sensibility= Body and Mind).\nFind freedom in movement through the IDIOMATICS of the senses, exploratory TECHNIQUES, and the CURIOSITY within creative process.\n*INTUITION: (Developing your 6th Sense) Ability to predict and support movement, as well as, opening doors to the unconscious stories of the body/mind. Using aesthetic feedback scores, somatic transference, creative restrictions, blindfolded exercises, RE-membering natural origins and body part mapping.\n*EQUILIBRIUM: Finding balance and proprioceptive awareness in solo and in contact with others. Learning anatomically sound pathways of movement, head/tail connection, spiraling in and out of the floor, falling off your axis, turning upside down, working with your range of motion, traveling and changing direction/orientation.\n**Note: Class builds on itself so drop-in is not preferred unless you are an advanced/experienced dancer or you are attending the first classes in sequence. Pro-rated is fine- must contact email below.\n*Partial Scholarships available upon request.\nImagine all the dots are people.[:]::[::]:.[:..].:.:.:. ~secret codes~Etc.\nThis entry was posted in Pi\u00f1ata News, Teaching, Workshops and tagged Contact Improvisation, Contemporary Dance, pi\u00f1ata dance collective, release technique, somatics, tamalpa life-art process on February 28, 2017 by Elizabeth Boubion.",

    "text": "Security continues to be a major issue within the crypto space.\nAlthough Blockchains are designed for optimal security because of their decentralized nature, this has not prevented the users and institutions operating on these Blockchains from being exposed to hackers.\nFrom Mt.Gox exchange ($473 million hacked), to Bitfinex ($72 million hacked), and most recently, Crypto Youtuber Ian Balina ($2 million hacked).\nIt\u2019s clear that users and exchanges are still very exposed.\nFortunately, a new Blockchain company called Sentinel Protocol promises a solution to secure our exchanges and funds.\nSentinel Protocol is offering a cyber security ecosystem that leverages the collective intelligence of cyber security specialists, as well as advanced technologies like machine learning and sandboxing to help crypto traders and exchanges protect their crypto currencies.\nIt works by providing a threat reputation database, which contains security intelligence information like the addresses of confirmed dangerous wallets belonging to hackers, or malicious URL\u2019s.\nThe database sits on the Blockchain and is connected to API\u2019s.\nExchanges and other organizations can use these API\u2019s in order to receive an alert or block an action whenever they encounter any of these malicious URLs or wallet addresses.\nSentinel protocol provides 3 main security features: The Sentinel Portal or Threat reputation database (TDRB), Machine-learning engine integrated security wallet (S-wallet), and a distributed malware analysis sandbox (D-Sandbox).\nThe threat reputation database is designed to offer a decentralized source of shared knowledge amongst security vendors. This database is provided as an API that individuals and organizations can connect to.\nTraditionally, security vendors would compile information by themselves and store them in the centralized databases of their respective organizations.\nThis lead to security blind spots due to the lack of complete information, as well as the centralization of vital data creating a single point of failure (NSA\u2019s hacking by Russian state hackers in October 2017 is an example of this flaw).\nTRDB uses a token incentive scheme that encourages vendors to contribute to an ever-expanding threat database containing hacker\u2019s wallet addresses, malicious URI\u2019s, phishing addresses, malware hashes, and more.\nSubmissions are validated based on group consensus and feedback from participants using the Delegate proof of stake method.\nOnly security experts can update TRDB, however, general users can also participate by auto reporting or manual reporting.\nAuto reporting allows Sentinel Protocols machine learning based security wallet to automatically detect unknown threats the user comes across while connected to the TDRB API.\nWhen a threat is identified, it is sent to the database. Manual reporting requires the user to report the risk information themselves, which is then validated by the security community afterwords.\nS- Wallets can be held by individuals or institutions to store their crypto currencies with enhanced security.\nThe S-Wallet uses machine learning to anticipate incoming security threats based on information gathered from the threat reputation database. The wallet operates like anti- virus software, except it doesn\u2019t have to wait to receive updates from a centralized server. It can be more proactive in its detection based on analysis of threat tendencies and history gathered from the TRDB.\nThe S-Wallet is especially effective against Ransom ware threats, and provides filters for Crypto currency wallet addresses, URL/URI\u2019s and other forms of Data.\nThe machine learning technology also enables Sentinel Protocols Fraud Detection System to identify transactions that are reported for misuse or stolen.\nSandbox is a security mechanism that isolates untested and unverified programs. These programs are isolated away from the main application and into a testing environment so that potential threats can be analyzed and submitted to collective intelligence via a ticket system.\nThese 3 features of Sentinel Protocol are overseen by the \u2018Sentinels\u2019, a group of security experts, individuals and organizations who serve to validate hacking claims, analyze the root cause of a threat, and update the TRDB.\nJust like how black hat hackers are incentivized by money to perform malicious activities, Sentinel protocol aims to create an ecosystem where white hat hackers (or Sentinels) can earn money by contributing to the security intelligence of the ecosystem.\nSentinels earn \u2018sentinel points\u2019 for their contributions, and these points can later be converted to crypto tokens called UPP (Uppsala) Tokens.\nSentinel points are added up as a reputation score that evaluates how much a Sentinel has helped a hacking victim, or contributed to the TRDB.\nUsers can make indirect contributions and earn sentinel points by creating or translating articles to alert the community about cyber-security threats.\nUPP tokens are the currency used to pay for security features within the Sentinel Protocol ecosystem.\nThe threat detection database as well as API integration come free, while users have to pay UPP tokens to use more advanced features like Machine Learning-based anomaly detection or Distributed-sandboxing.\nSentinel Protocol gathers one of the most experienced teams in the Blockchain space. Their combined expertize in cyber security spans decades, and involved working for major corporations as well as Governments.\nPatrick came up with the idea for Sentinel Protocol when in 2016, 7,218 Ether (around $70,000 at the time) was stolen from his wallet as a result of a hack.\nHe took this very unfortunate incident and turned it into a business opportunity by starting Uppsala foundation, which Sentinel Protocol is under.\nPatrick brings 10 years of experience with network security and system architecture at Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet.\nBefore this, he was Koreas chief technology consultant at Darktrace, and AI focused global security company. He consulted the government and large corporations including Korea Cyber Defense and Samsung.\nHae leads the business operations of Sentinel Protocol. He has over ten years of IT security experience, specializing in database architecture, web application firewall (two patents), fin-tech security, and machine learning.\nPrior to Sentinel Protocol, Hae designed the DB architecture of the corporate banking system at KB Bank, and led global business operations in Korea at F5 Networks and Darktrace.\nJohn has over 25 years of international experience in Asia\u2019s high-tech industry. He specializes in next-generation software solutions to address the needs of organizations throughout the key markets across the Asia Pacific region, particularly in Japan.\nPrior to Sentinel Protocol, John held senior roles with several leading technology companies including WatchGuard Technologies, Softbank, CyberGuard, and Darktrace.\nSentinel has a very utility focused Token structure. They have well-designed incentive structures to create the best ecosystem for cyber security.\nThe success of Sentinel protocol is very reliant on external assistance. I\u2019m not sure if tokens will be enough to incentivize cyber security experts to collaborate with each other, especially if they compare what they will earn as part of the sentinel network versus working exclusively for one Blockchain (or non-Blockchain) company.\nThe money individuals or institutions pay to get access to exclusive security features is a big factor preventing the best security experts from collaborating with each other today. There\u2019s also the issue of secrecy between nations, which may prevent many cyber security experts who work for Governments from contributing.\nSentinel protocols Token Pre Sale starts on May 23.\nTheir public sale starts on May 27th and ends on June 10th. The company is looking to raise $32,900,000, and have already raised $23,294,012.\nSentinel protocol is offering a service that solves a critical problem within the crypto community \u2013 security.\nAs more exchanges are launched and more crypto users emerge, security will only become a bigger issue.\nBy becoming one of the first Blockchains to focus entirely on security, Sentinel protocol is well positioned to be a relevant player in this space for a long time.\nThe company has wisely chosen not to go the route of conventional marketing, and is instead focused on bringing real world cyber-security experts to Sentinel Protocol, and establishing partnerships with exchanges, wallets and payment services.\nThey may face some initial challenges recruiting the best security experts to the network. These players are already in high demand and will be dealing with competing interests in the real world.\nHowever, overtime we do believe Sentinel protocol will begin to achieve a network effect as institutional investors enter the space and demand higher levels of security to protect their funds.",

    "text": "Setting up an Adwords Campaign can be daunting. There seems to be no end of options, dialogue boxes and drop down menus! So you\u2019ve created an ad and got it displayed on Google\u2019s Ad Network. You\u2019ve even had a few clicks. But what now? How can I tell if all this time, money and effort is actually doing my project any good? As we provide Adwords management services to many companies we can walk you though it.\nCongratulations \u2013 you can untick the \u201cAdWords Novice\u201d check-box because you are well on your way to joining the community of \u201cSerious AdWords Users\u201d. You can accomplish this with the Google AdWords Conversion Tracking Tool. Basically Conversion Tracking works by identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that you set up.\nFirst off you need to decide which Indicator (or indicators) is/are important to you. eg. you need to ask yourself \u201cWhy am I running this AdWords Campaign and what do I want to achieve?\u201d.\nPopular responses are to generate sales, gain user downloads and sign-ups, form-fills, app downloads, generate leads or even have direct phone calls to your business. The system is so flexible that you can actually import your own \u201coffline\u201d data too (e.g. a sale in a bricks and mortar outlet).\nAfter your conversion goals have been set, Google can associate them with the AdWords activity that lead to the conversion. This is when AdWords comes into it\u2019s own. The resulting data can help you to fine-tune your campaign by optimising your keywords, ads, quality score and bid. When you hit the sweet spot, it\u2019s a case of How many units would you like to sell?\nSo what are these Four Main Methods? Here we go!\nStart by clicking the Tools/Conversions menu option. Click the red \u201c+Conversion\u201d button.\n1) Website tracking. After answering some questions about how the conversion works, AdWords will give you a code snippet to paste onto your website. It will normally go on a webpage of your site like \u201cOrder Confirmation\u201d or \u201cThanks for Contacting Us\u201d.\n2) App Activity. Adwords can get you up and running with Android data for App installs and In-App purchases, but if you need iOS or more complex user activity, you will need to install the FireBase SDK (Or similar).\n3) Phone calls. Track calls to your Ads by using a Google forwarding phone number or by adding a tag to your website. This can be very powerful when used in conjunction with Location Extensions and ad scheduling for the times of day you want the phone to ring.\nAfter you have saved the conversion data, click done and that\u2019s it. Google will do the rest to marry up all AdWords activity with any confirmed Conversion Goals. If you have any questions or need some assistance with setting up your Conversion Goals, please don\u2019t hesitate to use the JivoChat widget or drop us a Contact Message.",

Clear the clutter, you\u2019ll free up space and make your kitchen more efficient and more pleasant to work in.\nAnd, judging from my best Instagram pics of 2016, people like how food looks in jars. WARNING: If you go plastic-free and zero-waste, you may develop a jar obsession.\nEven a little bit of meal planning will reduce food waste, save money, save time, reduce stress, improve your diet and probably improve the taste of your food (because you\u2019ll plan for tasty stuff rather than just grabbing the first thing you find in the cupboard). I start meal planning by going through my fridge and pantry and making meals out of what I find there first.

Cut processed food and you can skip the other five resolutions. You\u2019ll eat better, cut down on plastic packaging and be healthier.\nCan you really get a mango slicer? I obviously need to get out more, maybe I could use a bagel guillotine too. Don\u2019t think so!\nMy older daughter used to have a mango slicer and a couple of days before I wrote this post, my younger daughter spied a bagel slicer at the thrift shop. She asked for it (I think just to see my reaction) but I said no way (I\u2019m mean\u2026).\nHey there \u2013 I love love love this post.

We used to have them at work and they would just mangle the bagel!\nThey look like they would break easily whereas I\u2019m pretty sure I will pass down my knives to my kids (including a bread knife that cuts bagels really well!).",

    "text": "This post provides a bit of an overview of my plans for my as-yet unnamed RPG. One of the biggest lessons I learned with my previous game (which I talked a bit about here) is that players want to interact. The in-game chat was pretty much an afterthought in my previous game (in fact, it was the very last feature I added before going to \"alpha\"). Most of the work I did post-release was community-based features -- an alliance system, one-on-one and group private chats, and so on.\nSo I wanted to make sure my new game supported a vibrant community right from the beginning. Also, I was a little tired of the limitations of working with a phone, so I wanted something that ran on a PC. But more than that, I wanted something that was cross-platform (I personally use a Mac laptop and a Linux workstation, so it needed to run on those platforms as well as Windows, of course). Because I'm a masochist, I decided make the game browser-based.\nSo I made it fully 3D with three.js as the backend renderer. In fact it's actually not that hard to get webgl up and running -- the hardest part, at least for me, was content. The initial \"rewrite\" was still talking to the same backend server, so it still supported all those wonderful multiplayer features, but I had an MD2 model (from Quake) as my main character, and some procedurally generated tree I found somewhere as decoration.\nThe most interesting thing about the rewrite is the terrain. I found this cool article on Gamasutra and implemented it as a GLSL shader in three.js.\nThen I taught myself how to use blender to create some basic 3D objects and animations. All the content in the current gameplay video was made by me in blender. Yay!",

However, still unknown are how DA concentrations dynamically change during the morphine-induced CPP test and whether tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a vital role in this process. In the present study, we measured dynamic changes in TH and phosphorylated TH serine 40 (pTH Ser(40)) and pTH Ser(31) proteins in the VTA, and DA concentrations in the NAc at 5 min intervals during a 30 min morphine-induced CPP test. Rats that underwent morphine-induced CPP training significantly preferred the morphine-paired chamber during the CPP expression test, an effect that lasted at least 30 min in the drug-free state. DA concentrations in the NAc markedly increased at 15 min when the rats were returned to the CPP boxes to assess the expression of preference for the previously drug-paired chamber. DA concentrations then declined 2 h after the CPP test. TH and pTH Ser(40) levels, but not pTH Ser(31) levels, in the VTA were enhanced during the CPP test. These results indicated that TH and the phosphorylation of TH Ser(40) in the VTA may be responsible for DA synthesis and release in the NAc during the behavioral expression of conditioned reward elicited by a drug-associated context.\nProject Intro.

If a summer treat company has a cool, refreshing cafe logo, they can be sure that their parlors will be full during the warm weather months. Here are some ice cream and frozen yogurt shop logos from well-known establishments that entice customers with their use of color, shape, and image.\nThis well known national chain has one key brand element that is represented in their logo: their offering of thirty-one flavors. Their logo is in a blue and pink color meant to appeal to the young and the young at heart, while the thick, slightly tilted letters also convey a child-like image. In a clever way, the B and R that are the store\u2019s initials also make a \u201831\u2019, which refers to the store\u2019s number of available flavors. This logo is well-recognized throughout the United States and even the world, making it an effective branding element. Read about the Baskin Robins logo makeover.\nThis fast food establishment offers a full line of foods but is best known for their ice cream treats. The logo is not just an eye-catching red, but in the shape of lips. The arc-like waves are not just a symbol of movement and change; the orange wave above the lettering represents the company\u2019s hot foods, while the blue wave below represents the cold treats. These tie into the company tagline: Hot Eats, Cool Treats. The change in branding from Dairy Queen to DQ is also reflected in this branding, as the company\u2019s initials are front and center in an italicized font.\nThis logo avoids the cute and childish, instead presenting the brand as a grown-up treat that people of all ages can enjoy. The black, gold, and white color palette is sophisticated, while the banner like shape of the logo suggests quality and excellence. The letters are bold with serifs, making the company appear large and substantial. However, the logo has small imperfections that make it appear homemade, hinting at the artisanal nature of the ice cream.\nThis ice cream shop is a current favorite due to the almost infinite number of flavor combinations that customers can custom create. The logo has a classic color scheme for casual restaurants: red and yellow. The writing is bold with serifs, but there are a few swirls and long serifs to add interest. An inclusive circle holds a swirling ice cream cone in one of the chain\u2019s signature waffle cones. This logo might be more personal to the company if it somehow\u2014outside of the name, that is\u2014communicated the aspect that makes the company so popular\u2014the cold stone slab on which the ice cream is mixed.\nThis ice cream store promises the country\u2019s best yogurt, but the logo screams traditional ice cream shop. From the red lettering to the thick letters to the ice cream cone beside the name, this logo incorporates many elements that are generally seen in establishments offering less healthy treats. Because most frozen yogurt buyers want a frozen treat that tastes like traditional ice cream without the drawbacks, this similarity to other logos may be one successful part of the branding.\nThis frozen yogurt shop has gained quite a following despite being located in only a few cities, partially due to the healthier nature of its products. The less sweetened yogurt is tangier than the average frozen treat and a variety of healthy toppings such as fresh fruit and granola are available for the health conscious consumer to choose from. The logo shows this value with a primarily green color, as this is a hue generally associated with plants and healthy foods. The image to the right of the words features the pink berry for which the chain is named, in a round, friendly shape.\nThis ice cream is different from others because it is deep frozen into tiny balls that melt into ice cream as they are eaten. The logo is in soft, pastel colors with casual lower case writing. Pastel dots refer to the nature of the product while also forming a friendly, inclusive circle. The tagline is written at the bottom: \u2018the ice of the future\u2019. It is impossible to look at this logo and not understand that this ice cream is different from the competition, making it a clear winner.\nThis regional ice cream chain offers the same playful blue and pink color scheme as many other frozen treat shops, but with a key difference. The colors are used as outlining on otherwise white letters that are in a thick, traditional font with serifs. To the right is a soft serve ice cream cone with sprinkles arcing toward it in a wave-like shape that connotes movement and growth. Because this company is constantly growing and offering new products and locations, this is a very appropriate image.\nThis ice cream shop offers the familiar pink and blue colors, but in a circular shape that is friendly and inviting. The cow that is the central character of the store is in the center of the circle smiling. The playful lettering appeals to children and families, while the use of a character is a good branding move for these audiences as well. The use of \u2018treatery\u2019 in the name rather than \u2018eatery\u2019 is a play on words that makes the store all the more inviting.\nLike Dairy Queen and other ice cream stores, Foster\u2019s Freeze offers a full line of fast food products. However, the company focus is on the ice cream as well as the general retro experience of the store. The logo retains the inviting fifties image with old-fashioned cursive writing while the wording \u2018old fashion\u2019 further portray\u2019s this image. The ice cream cone character resembles the soft serve cone that is the establishment\u2019s best known product, while adding more retro charm. The deep blue color palette is cool and inviting.",

    "text": "Can you believe week six of school is already coming to a close? It seems like just yesterday freshman were moving in and it was syllabus week. Currently we are in the middle of mid-terms and it is a stressful time on campus. People are rushing about from class to class, studying, and working on those projects that are due in the coming weeks. But that is okay, there is only a week left in mid-term season and life on campus will be back to normal.\nAll the hours studying this semester have made me think about my three favorite places to study on campus, and I thought I would share them with you!\nGSIS Building: There is a lounge in the GSIS building with couches and tables for students to relax and study at. It is one of the newer buildings on campus and is normally pretty quit during the day (except when classes are transitioning). Perfect if you want to be left alone to study or do homework.\nEveryone I have talked to has different places they prefer to study but these are my top picks. Hope these help you find your quiet place to study, and ace your mid-terms. I wish everyone brains as they continue through mid-term season, it will be over soon!\nMy name is Marquette Davis and I studied abroad in the United Kingdom for one month in the summer of 2016. Although this program is called a study abroad in England, I say the United Kingdom because in the month that we were there, we were not just in England. We had the opportunity to explore the entire United Kingdom. Many of the locals we met told us, upon hearing our travel plans for the month, we would get to see more of England and more of the UK than they had ever seen and they had lived there their entire lives. Traveling to the big city of London and the small seaside towns of Northern England and Scotland and the historic cities Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Bath, and the scenic towns of Wales, we took part in an awesome adventure all over the United Kingdom. And the greatest part about it was that we could personalize it because we were in our own van. And the second greatest part about it was that we probably walked as many miles as we drove, which made for some incredible and unusual sightseeing.\nAside from the wonder of all the travel and the cultural experiences we got to partake in, the different foods we tried and the various people we met, it was an intellectually stimulating experience. Completing seven credit hours in one month, every day was busy with classes and homework. Classroom and lab times were never boring and the small class setting made each penny per credit worthwhile. Be warned, however, that the work load was not for the faint of heart. One of the greatest lessons I learned while in England was how to seize the day and make the most of my experiences, meanwhile completing a semester\u2019s worth of school work in four weeks. Sleep became a secondary need. I made the most of my time there and maintained a pleasing grade and still did not have any regrets about any missed opportunities. Even as we traveled, we lived and breathed what we had learned in our classes, making them all the more worthwhile and exciting.\nIn addition, we were in the United Kingdom at the time of the mass shooting in Orlando and at the time of the Brexit vote by which the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. With these events occurring, we were able to experience how a massive tragedy in the U.S. is globally affective. Walking the streets of London, we even came across a banner that read, \u201cWe Stand with Orlando.\u201d And we were able to see firsthand the reaction of the UK people to a major national event. Needless to say, with these events taking place and our presidential election upon us, the English people were eager to know our political stances on several issues, including gun laws, nationalism, and Trump/Bernie/Hilary, and they were eager to share their opinions on their own national issues. I had the pleasure, for example, escaping the rain one evening in Bath, to talk to the manager of a shoe store for a brief time who excitedly conversed with me over British and American politics.\nThis brings me to my next point. Of all the amazing history and incredible places we saw, it was the people that I will remember most and hold most dear to my heart. Granted I came across more rude people than I had ever encountered, but the good outweighed the bad. I will always remember the three locals we shared jokes with at the smallest pub in the UK; the friendly Chinese couple I listened to one of our students practice her Chinese with during high tea on the Thames River; the kind French girl who led our horseback ride along the beach in Inverary, Scotland; the professors at our host university; all our friendly waiters and waitresses; the pub owner who helped us struggle through the Welsh word \u201cLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\u201d for extra credit; the employees of Dunollie Castle who allowed us to conduct a crime scene investigation in the middle of their work day and even participated as witnesses and interviewees; and all others who took our pictures, gave us directions, or made friendly conversation with us on the buses, trains, and planes along the way. I am particularly grateful and would like to give a shout out to the employees of United who were so helpful to me in the airport when I had issues with my flights and had to find my way home. And lastly, in the month I was in England, together in good times and in bad, I developed a relationship with my fellow students and with our professor that I will always cherish. Above all the experiences and sights, it is these people that I will hold dear when I remember my study abroad.\nFrom my study abroad experience, I gained seven credits toward my degree, friendships I will always be able to turn to with my fellow students, and a mentor that I truly respect in my professor. In addition, as a GSIS student, I achieved my first international experience that I believe has opened the door to many more international travels and potential career opportunities. I discovered the path I want to take in my degree program by taking Interviewing Techniques and Forensic Science and finding out what I really enjoyed to do. I grew as a person, figuring out my way through a foreign country and culture with a group of people that were mostly strangers to me before the study abroad, and was exposed to the diversity that exists just between two English speaking western cultures, really opening my eyes to the incredible diversity that exists globally.\nI am so grateful for the opportunity I had to study in England in the summer of 2016. I will never forget my time there and will eternally appreciate all the incredible experiences.\nI\u2019m Trupti Mahendrakar from Bangalore, India. Exploring and innovating is my passion. I joined Riddle in Fall 2015. Since then till now, I was encouraged and motivated to do what I like. Professor\u2019s here are so helpful. The entire institution makes me feel at home. My first semester here, I came up with an idea of making Graphene based composites. Later, I got to know that the University encourages and funds student researches through Ignite or Undergraduate Research Institute (URI). All I had to do was to find a Professor who can help me with my project and find a group of people who are interested. Thus, I started Alternate Composite Team (ACT).\nHere are some pictures of me and my team working. It may not look fun but remember \u201cAppearance can be deceptive.\u201d So come on over and try it yourself.\nI am officially signing off for good. It has been an awesome four years blogging for all of our readers out there but, its time to go!! I am happy to say that I have a job now, in the \u201creal world\u201d as the professors at ERAU like to call it.\nAs some of you know from my previous blogs I got my job through AFROTC, which I was involved in over the last 4 years at Riddle. It is a great program and if you are willing to give it a shot you can learn a lot about yourself while securing a future position in the Air Force. Not everyone makes it through but, boy does it feel good if you are one of the lucky ones who does!\nSummer is a great time where free time is not scarce. However if you don\u2019t plan it well it can become really boring after a couple of weeks.\nMy summer started in May right after I finished my hardest test, Themes and Humanities. An English class can be quite challenging. That day I came straight home and I fell sleep for about 12 hours until the next day. Some people go out dinner, others go out to party, others start driving back home, I just wanted to sleep. I was exhausted.\nI was busy to hanging out, going to the lake to do nothing other than lay down at the shore, and I started playing chess again at the Prescott Public Library (By the way, those elder men know how play chess, I didn\u2019t win one single game.) \u2014-The remaining 2 months is a story for another time.\nI realize that having fun and doing what you love is as important as getting good grades. I started thinking \u201cHow I could stop doing what I love to do?\u201d I came to conclusion that there has to be a balance between college and time for yourself and this year as a sophomore, I am going to find this balance.",

    "text": "All right-minded people would agree that gathering data through seemingly innocent and simple questions and interfaces, analysing and interpreting that data to gain a view on behaviour and wants is fine, but that using that data to inform and drive unrelated and unlinked conditions and experiences of peoples\u2019 lives is completely unacceptable.\nBut I wonder if up until the point that they \u2018removed\u2019 the data from Facebook that all Cambridge Analytica did was exploit human behaviour \u2013 you know - our own inherent laziness and weakness?\nLet\u2019s start with trying to understand if the majority of people really care if what they see as \u2018harmless\u2019 personal data is used for various unrelated news, opinion and content creation and curation. If I were to ask anyone in the street to tell me what their favourite colour, animal, country and food are and that I would then be able to influence every political decision they make over the next 6 months \u2013 they would basically laugh in my face.\nI mean - it\u2019s completely and utterly absurd, an individuals\u2019 political beliefs are just that \u2013 there is no way that would influence any final decision an individual made - right? So why would an individual care if companies try and use harmless data for other means \u2013 they are not going to fall for that.\nBut that\u2019s the accusation aimed at Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.\nHow about adding to the harmlessness of \u2018soft\u2019 data - the inherent human condition of laziness?\nSure, there are a very many number of people to which the complexities of the issues facing society politically, economically and culturally are understood and of great concern. Many of these are well informed and take a deep interest in these subjects \u2013 going out of their way to educate themselves to make sure that they have visibility of the full picture.\nBut there are a huge majority of people that do not spend a huge amount of time working through detail \u2013 life gets in the way - and this where you could actually argue that Cambridge Analytica were being smart - playing on the fact that they knew that the vast majority of people were lazy and didn\u2019t like reading long winded newspaper articles. They then identified that Facebook as the ideal place for people to be able to see \u2018news\u2019 in a very passive way.\nThey know that Social Media in general doesn't just play on peoples' desire to be social but in many cases their laziness and inertia - after all it is an ever scrolling world of indifference. They know that this plays straight into the hands of those that are able to gain access to levels of personal information and have the ability to constantly refine messages until they hit a nerve. - like Cambridge Analytica.\nThis isn\u2019t insight gained through analytical excellence - it\u2019s a very simple understanding of human behaviour and laziness - which you can gain by talking to anyone over a drink.\nSo, we therefore have the following inputs into an algorithm - harmless data and human laziness.\nNow we add groupthink laziness. Just as the Remain campaign were lazy and didn\u2019t challenge the Brexit camp openly enough, so the Democrats really didn\u2019t believe that Trump could win and consequently waged the wrong campaign. Or at least didn\u2019t push their messages across in the right way to connect with the lower educated or lazy groups (quote from Mr Mike Rundle).\nAsking for and taking harmless personal data.\nAllows you to identify and define the level of manipulation/content required to influence.\nAn algorithm as old as time because - however long the circumference - life and civilisation goes in circles. The Athenians and the ancient Chinese (specifically the Han dynasty) - knew that playing on people's inertia can create a false sense of dependency and trust allowing messages and influence to be (depending on individual opinion) manipulated.\nPutin knows this, Cambridge Analytica know this, Mark Zuckerberg knows this - and today although the delivery method has changed - the algorithm is the same as it ever was.",

    "text": "The man sitting behind me whispers the rosary and wheezes. He\u2019s loud but it becomes a kind of background music.\nThe people in front of us are old. Older than we are. Most of them live in the senior housing across the street, so they walk. The children aren\u2019t here this morning; with an afternoon Mass on Christmas Eve, it gives the families an opportunity to spend Christmas morning together at home.\nThis is the church where we were married, seventeen years ago. It sits on a hill. This church stood above the floodwaters of March 2010, when the Pawtuxet River turned into a lake. It used to be known as the French church, when the village of Natick thrived with mill activity. Down the street is the Italian church, with a CVS separating the two structures. We\u2019ve been away from this church; now we\u2019re back.\nOur pastor is old. He moves slowly on the altar, lighting candles and turning on the pre-recorded carols. We learn later that he\u2019s endured radiation treatment. He looks good.\nOne of our neighbors is here, with his wife. Last year, he was hit by a car. When he walks, his body is crooked. Just before Communion, he faints, which halts the distribution of hosts to us while some of the men tend to him. Someone calls a rescue from his cell phone, but our neighbor tells everyone he\u2019ll be alright. His wife pats him on the back.\nI say some prayers for Jonnie, who is at the Hasbro Children\u2019s Hospital ICU, after a BB gun accident on Christmas Eve. He\u2019s so young, and a beautiful, happy boy. He is foremost in my thoughts this morning. Later, I find out from his mom that he is better, but it\u2019s still a waiting game. All those jokes from \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d seem horribly lame and inappropriate.\nWe are a small family. There are two elders, one tethered to a bottle of oxygen, one who doesn\u2019t hear well so we speak loudly. We give thanks for the things we have and remember that there are people alone today. Some who wish to be alone, some who want company more than food. But we find reason to be happy, to laugh and smile. And we drink wine and eat good food and groan afterwards.\nAnd then we drive home in the dark. Someone puts a small lighted deer at the edge of a cliff above the highway. It stands alone, and we look forward to seeing him. He watches over us as we find our way home.",

    "text": "We check out the underrated AU Falcon XR8 range and Australia's Windsor-powered limited editions.\nWith the recent resurgence in the popularity of high-performance Ford vehicles, it's only natural that previous models will now be looked back on in a new light. In Part One of this series we looked at the EB to EL Ford XR8s. This time we'll check out the most powerful Windsor-powered machines \u2013 the late-model AU Falcon XR8 and the various limited edition models.\nFollowing the EB-EL shape XR8, Ford Australia introduced the all-new AU model in 1998.\nThe AU Falcon copped plenty of flack about its innovative styling when released but, thankfully, the XR version managed to escape much of this criticism thanks to its more attractive quad headlight front-end. XR8s were also fitted with a subtle body kit and an optional bi-level rear spoiler, which is said to generate actual downforce \u2013 it doesn't merely reduce rear aero lift.\nBut the biggest news in the AU Falcon was the long-awaited introduction of a double wishbone independent rear suspension. This \u2013 combined with a host of other chassis and suspension changes \u2013 gives the AU XR8 class-leading handling and stability. The standard wheel size is 16 inch but many buyers spent extra on 17s.\nUnder its bonnet, the AU XR8 adopts a Windsor 5.0 that was said to be designed for the US-market Ford Explorer. This engine brought new heads, inlet manifold, camshaft and the EEC-V engine management was recalibrated to suit. Peak power remained pegged at 185kW but peak torque increases slightly to 412Nm (achieved at 5000 and 3500 rpm respectively).\nFitted with either a revised 5 speed manual or 4 speed auto, the 1650-odd kilogram AU XR8 can accelerate to 100 km/h in the low 8 second range. The quarter mile takes a shade under 16.0 seconds.\nFor the 2000 Series 2 version of the AU XR8, the faithful Windsor V8 was given another major revision.\nStruggling to compete with Holden's newly introduced 5.7 litre LS1 V8, Ford Australia gave the Windsor an upgrade to the tune of 200kW at 5000 rpm and 420Nm at 3650 rpm. This powerplant \u2013 when backed with the base 5 speed manual gearbox \u2013 delivers a LS1-beating launch but falls behind as road speed increases. The AUII XR8 can rip to 100 km/h in the low 7 second bracket and does the quarter mile thing in low 15s - not hanging around.\nThe XR8 ute received the 200kW donk in early 2001.\nTo cope with the extra speed, Ford offered standard dual-pot front brakes and an optional 329mm Premium brake package. Other options include leather, a high-end sound system and body kit. The body received less daring styling and the original AU XR8's bi-level rear spoiler was dropped to make way for a conventional single element spoiler.\nAnd just when you thought you'd seen everything the AU had to offer, the Series II was boosted to 220kW half way through its model run.\nThe 220kW Windsor was hand-built by Tickford and features reengineered cast iron heads, a match-ported intake manifold, larger throttle body, ceramic coated headers and revised camshaft. Fuel pressure was also increased and the management system was recalibrated. Compression ratio had crept up to 9.4:1 \u2013 still low enough to cope with normal unleaded fuel.\nProducing 220kW at 5250 rpm and 435Nm at 4000 rpm, the late AUII XR8 is decidedly quick. In 5 speed manual guise, it can launch to 100 km/h in high 6s and run the quarter mile in high 14s.\nThe final AU XR8 \u2013 the AUIII \u2013 appeared in late 2001 was available with the choice of a traditional XR appearance or a Ford Racing body kit. It was unaltered mechanically.\nSecond-hand, these 220kW monsters fetch around $25 to $30 grand.\nThe AUIII stepped aside for the BA series in late 2002.\nFord Australia \u2013 as opposed to its FTE division \u2013 released only one limited edition of the AU XR8.\nThe 2001 XR8 Rebel employs the same hand-built 220kW engine found in the late AUII XR8, 18 inch Speedline alloys, a Ford Racing body kit and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a Sony PS2 for home use! A copy of Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (signed by Glenn Seton and Steven Richards) was also thrown in on the deal.\nWhat's the point? Well, Sony included the FTR racecar in the vehicle line-up of GT3 and this is a 'celebration'.\nNot long after the release of the original EB-series XR8, Ford rekindled the glory days of old and released another Falcon GT.\nThe 1992 25th Anniversary EB Falcon GT employs a heavily reworked Windsor 5.0 with big valve GT40 heads, hydraulic lifters, roller rockers, a high-flow intake manifold and throttle body, large diameter airflow meter and a recalibrated engine management system. This gave the EBII GT an even 200kW at 5200 rpm and 420Nm of torque at 4000 rpm.\nIt was more than enough to take on HSVs from the same era.\nThe EBII GT was available with a T5 5 speed featuring a heavy-duty Mustang Cobra gearset and upgraded bearings, while the optional 4 speed auto was a recalibrated BTR 85LE unit. The auto version uses a shorter diff ratio than the manual.\nA comprehensive add-on aero kit, bigger brakes, improved suspension, 17 inch alloys and mega-dollar 235/40 Pirelli P Zero tyres give the EBII GT all-round talents to match its grunt. Its high price tag also meant full leather/timber trim, climate control and electric everything was essential.\nUnfortunately, the 'give it everything' approach contributed to a substantial 1646kg kerb weight. Combine this with doubts that the engine really made 200kW and it's no surprise the EBII GT struggles to hit 100 km/h in 7.5 seconds. Auto versions took low 8s and around 16 seconds to run the quarter mile.\nFord retrospectively admitted the Ford was built as a luxury express to satisfy men who had once owned GT Falcons of the '60s and '70s.\nAn immaculate 1992 EB GT currently fetches around AUD$20,000 due to its collector appeal.\nHot on the heels of the EBII GT was the ED XR8 Sprint \u2013 a vehicle that offers virtually the same performance without all the hoo-ha.\nThe XR8 Sprint is equipped with essentially the same engine as the EBII GT but, curiously, it is quoted with 8kW less. The Sprint is said to generate 192kW at 5000 rpm and 404Nm at 4000 rpm.\nAlso available in 5 speed manual and 4 speed auto form, the cloth trimmed XR8 Sprint weighs almost 100kg less than the EBII GT and takes only 7.3 seconds to accelerate to 100 km/h. The quarter mile requires only 15.0 seconds of your time.\nVisually, the XR8 Sprint received unique chunky-style 16 inch alloys and Sprint badges. The interior is standard ED XR8 fare with the addition of a Momo wheel.\nAn ED XR8 Sprint currently costs around AUD$15,000 depending on kilometres and condition.\nThe GT name was dusted off once again for the 1997 EL Falcon series.\nThe EL GT \u2013 which is based on the top-line Fairmont Ghia \u2013 is equipped with a total of 11 stick-on body parts and an integrated bonnet vent. The look is, well, controversial but unarguably attention-getting... At least the rear spoiler is effective \u2013 it is said to reduce rear axle lift by a massive 70 percent.\nBehind its vertical barred grille are a pair of air intake scoops, which ram induction air into a free-flow induction system. The intake manifold was also swapped for a mandrel bent tubular set-up with a 65mm throttle body. The heads are cast-iron GT40 items with 2mm oversize inlet valves and providing a 9.0:1. compression ratio. Interestingly, the cam profile is identical to that used in the cooking model Windsor but increased valve lift is achieved through the use of 1.7:1 roller rockers (instead of conventional 1.6:1 units). Exhaust gasses pulse through 4>1 headers, twin cat converters and dual mufflers.\nThe EL GT's quoted power output is 200kW at 4700 rpm and it has 420Nm of torque at 3700 rpm. There's no doubting its power and torque figures, but its limited rev range is far from sporting.\nThe live axle suspension is retuned while 17 inch wheels, 329mm front discs and twin-spot calipers come standard. The cabin is decked out with leather trim, wood inlays, a Momo wheel, 240 km/h speedo and all the power luxuries Ford had available. This, like the EBII GT, adds weight and the EL GT tips the scales at 1668kg.\nAs a result, its straight-line performance is nothing astounding \u2013 0 \u2013 100 km/h in the mid 7s and the quarter takes mid 15s.\nPrice wise, an EL GT costs a bit more than a comparable EBII GT \u2013 up to around AUD$25,000 for one in collector's condition.\nDuring the AU Series 1 timeframe, Ford's newly formed FTE division released the T-series.\nThe 1999 TE50 and Fairlane-based TL50 were the first AU models to use a 200kW version of the Windsor. The 200kW output was achieved using a more aggressive camshaft, aluminium roller rockers and bigger induction piping. Peak power arrives at 5000 rpm while peak torque \u2013 420Nm \u2013 can be reached at 3750 rpm.\nMarketed alongside the TE and TL50 was the mid-spec TS50, which boasted a full 220kW and 435Nm. Further camshaft development, big valve aluminium heads, a flow-matched GT40-type intake manifold, bigger throttle body, upgraded exhaust manifolds and cat converters and increased fuel pressure are required to achieve the 220kW output. Compression ratio remains at a mild 9.0:1. Note that both power and torque arrive at higher revs \u2013 peak power is at 5250 rpm and peak torque is at 4000 rpm. Unfortunately, much of the Windsor's previous refinement has been lost \u2013 the 220kW TS50 has a lumpy idle, which is a tell-tale sign of its relatively hot cam.\nAn electronic sports shift auto transmission \u2013 with buttons on the steering wheel \u2013 was standard for the first time in the TS and TL50 and was optional on the TE50.\nBoth TE and TS50s employ 329 x 28mm front discs with Cobra Mustang calipers. The discs are grooved and the master cylinder is modified to suit. The independent suspension systems of each are improved over the XR8. TS and TL50s also employ Koni dampers and traction control. Unique 17 inch alloys and 235/45 tyres come fitted to the TE, while the TS50 and TL50 use 18s with 245/40s.\nA chrome mesh grille, colour-coded headlight bezels and other subtle body touches give the TE-series their own look. Interiors are also upgraded, with the TE50 having sports fabric trim and the TS and TL50s having leather. A Momo wheel comes standard.\nWell, high 6 second 0 \u2013 100s are typical for the manual 220kW TS50. TL50 autos take about 7.5 seconds.\nWhen the Falcon AUII upgrade came along, the T-series received some important revisions.\nThe 200kW engine was dropped so the TE/TS and TL50 were now standard with 220kW/435Nm. A manual gearbox was also available on the TE and TS50s. Mechanically, the AUII T-series vehicles were given a revised cam profile, SVO alloy heads and recalibrated engine management to provide improved bottom-end performance. The big 329mm brake package was also made standard on TS and TL50s and optional on the TE50.\nOther engineering changes made to the AUII range apply to the T-series and there are other minor trim and detail changes. It appears that buyers wanted a greater variety of colours and styling options \u2013 not everyone wanted a subtle look.\nAnd now for what is the ultimate Windsor engine development \u2013 the Australian-built 5.6 litre stroker.\nFor late 2001, FTE released the hairy-chested T3 range of TE, TS and TL50s.\nThe T3s share the same under-bonnet monster \u2013 a 5.6 litre stroked Windsor. The big-cube motor is hand-built with a new crankshaft, ported GT40P iron heads with hi-po springs and valves, billet rods, lightweight 9.6:1 pistons, revised cam, 82mm throttle body, unique high-flow intake manifold and a conical air filter with a dedicated airflow meter.\nTry 250kW at 5250 rpm and a monster 500Nm at 4250 rpm!\nIt's no surprise these machines \u2013 despite weighing over 1700kg - can rip to 100 km/h in around 6.0 seconds in Tremec 5 speed manual form. The spread of torque and throttle responsive is also very strong. Just don't expect a huge amount of refinement \u2013 the 5.6 shakes around at idle and suffers excess vibration at high revs.\nBased on the AU Series III, the T3s feature a heavy-duty Dana M78 LSD, 355mm front discs with 4 pot Brembos, 18 inch wheels and an aggressive body kit on TE/TS50 models. Note that a 5.6 litre FTE Pursuit 250 ute was also released.\nWe've seen early 200kW TE50s appear for sale from AUD$25,000 while 5.6 litre TS50s nudge AUD$45,000.\nThe stroker T3s go into the history books as the undisputed king of Aussie Windsor performance. The only other Ford V8 that's managed to upstage them is the current DOHC beast 5.4 in the BA-series.",

The majority of cases represent a benign response to localized or systemic infection. Most children with lymphadenitis exhibit small, palpable cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes. Less common is enlargement of the suboccipital or postauricular nodes. Palpable supraclavicular, epitrochlear, and popliteal lymph nodes are uncommon, as are enlarged mediastinal and abdominal nodes.\nLymphadenitis may affect a single node or a group of nodes (regional adenopathy) and may be unilateral or bilateral.

    "text": "Will Election Hacking Split NATO?\nNATO\u2019s Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, has reportedly suggested that NATO may consider Russian interference in upcoming European elections as an attack triggering collective defense measures. Such a move could put NATO and its member states at odds with the United States, which carefully avoided calling Russian interference in the U.S. election even a violation of international law. It would also leave the United States with a difficult choice of potentially changing its view of the legality of election interference or contradicting the legal views of its NATO allies.\nNATO\u2019s founding treaty states in Article 5 that NATO members \u201cagree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all\u201d and that \u201cif such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence\u201d will assist the victim state. In a 2014 summit declaration, NATO governments made clear that cyberattacks could trigger collective self-defense under Article 5 and explained that a decision to invoke NATO\u2019s collective defense obligations would occur \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d According to The Independent, Bradshaw suggested that election interference may be such a case, explaining that \u201callegations of interference in American and European elections and an international disinformation campaign could cause the definition of an \u2018attack\u2019 to be widened\u201d for purposes of Article 5.\n\u201cArmed attack\u201d is a high threshold under international law, and as Ryan Goodman has explained, Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. election did not reach that level. Maybe a future cyberattack on election infrastructure could. But Bradshaw may have meant not that future election interference was likely to constitute an armed attack, but rather that NATO states should respond collectively to hostile actions below the armed attack threshold.\nThe continuing fears about Russian interference in upcoming European elections lend urgency to the need for state-to-state discussions about how to characterize election interference as a matter of international law. The United States\u2014or at least the Obama Administration\u2014staked out its position, but other states should weigh in and work toward a consensus among allies. Academics can continue to spar, but it is state practice that will and must settle the debate.",

Microsoft was recently named as one of the companies in the running to potentially buying Marketo, which was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1.79 billion in May. Microsoft\u2019s hat was also thrown into the ring as a potential buyer when rumors started circling about Salesforce looking to sell.\nWith the acquisition of LinkedIn, industry experts noted that the possibility of Microsoft acquiring Salesforce is no longer likely.\nMicrosoft will likely continue to evaluate acquisitions in the future, according to Mary Shea, Principal Analyst at Forrester Research. \"That said they have been very strategic with the Lynda.com and now LinkedIn deals. If you buy the combined total addressable market of $ 315B for the LinkedIn/Microsoft entity then there is more than enough market opportunity as well integration and execution challenges for Microsoft to focus on in the near and mid-term to fully maximize the potential of the LinkedIn deal.\nShea added that the LinkedIn acquisition is a huge boon for Microsoft. \"Microsoft has already been enjoying some good market traction with Dynamics, and now with the LinkedIn asset Microsoft will have more arrows in its quiver \u2014 in and above price \u2014 to compete head to head with Salesforce in the enterprise CRM space.\"\nShe suggests that, down the road, therer is a possibility for Microsoft to acquire one of the leading sales enablement players. \"Perhaps one of the content management platforms that utilize machine learning to push relevant content to B2B sellers at the right point in the cycle and provide other guided selling capabilities.\"",

    "text": "Panettone (paan eh tony) bread is one of my favorite things to make for Christmas. It is better than cookies and it\u2019s pretty! I love pretty on my Christmas table. The light and airy sweet bread also accents the heavier foods we stuff ourselves with at holiday meals.\nWhen I first saw this made, there were so many pieces, I was completely bored. Not sure about y\u2019all, but when I first started cooking, I wanted pretty, fun AND easy. This was less than fun. Then I tasted it and my goodness, I was hooked. I HAD to learn how to make this! Did I mention it was pretty? That year, I made so many, we gave out individual panettones as gifts to everyone we knew. It was for practice, y\u2019all!! I remember that like it was yesterday. There might\u2019ve been some funny looks when I went to the grocery store for oranges, lemons, raisins and rum extract three times in one day.\nNow, it is fun and such an ingrained tradition that it has become beautiful for a different reason. The few things I learned along the way, 1) NO, it is not Italian fruit cake. 2) Yes, it takes a longtime, but it is totally worth it. 3) use whatever accents you want, fruit,different fruit, chocolate or none. They will all taste good.\nCombine warm milk, yeast and 1 tsp sugar in a bowl. Set aside and let foam for 10 minutes.\nIn the bowl of a mixer, cream together remaining sugar, butter and vanilla. It will become light and fluffy (about 4-5 minutes).\nTurn mixer to low, add lemon and orange zest. Then add eggs one at a time and mix until all are well incorporated.\nWhisk flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and fold in the yeast and egg mixtures.\nUsing bread hook, knead for 5-6 minutes until the mixture starts to come together. The dough will be very sticky and won\u2019t be a smooth ball of dough.\nPour the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, by hand. Keep your hands and board well-floured to prevent dough from sticking and tearing.\nPut dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place for 2 hours, until dough has doubled in size.\nDuring the 2 hour rise, prepare your candied orange and lemon peels. Place the raisins in a small saucepan with the rum extract and heat on low for 5 minutes. Set all fruits aside to cool.\nWhen dough has doubled, turn it out on a lightly floured board and knead for another 5 minutes. Gradually knead in raisins, candied orange peels and candied lemon peels.\nShape the dough into a ball and drop into prepared Panettone pan/pans. If you do not have a metal panettone pan, wrap each Panettone paper wrapper with parchment paper and baker\u2019s string. This helps the dough cook upright instead of out. Cover in plastic wrap and let rest for about 90 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 325F and place rack in the middle of the oven.\nRemove the plastic wrap and brush the top of the Panettones with egg wash and sprinkle sugar over the top. Bake on the center rack of the oven for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.\nWhen done, pull bread out and allow to cool completely. Remove baker\u2019s string and let rest.\nOptional: Dust the top with confectioner\u2019s sugar when ready to serve.\nDont forget to follow FoodLovePlay on Pinterest, Instagram, Yummly and tumblr.",

La Perruche Sparman, Pl. 66, from Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets, c. 1805.\nJacques Barraband's engravings of birds are masterpieces of French ornithological illustration. These stunning portraits were done for the distinguished ornithologist Francois Levaillant, who commissioned the artist to illustrate his landmark works on African ornithology, including the lavish and striking Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets. Images of African birds were popular in early 19th-century France both for their exoticism and for the interest in Africa that Napoleon's campaigns were generating. The collaboration of Levaillant and Barraband represented a departure from previous ornithological texts in its emphasis on beauty and luxury, with sumptuously colored and flawlessly rendered birds. The project was a massive undertaking, which required over 300 finished watercolors. Apart from their undoubted beauty, they display a scientific accuracy that few ornithological artists have matched since. Still, the meticulous hand-colored engravings in Levaillant's publications could not match the delicate modulations of tone and color, the fine lines and perfect draftsmanship of Barraband's original watercolors, which are exceptional in their richness and tonal variation. Each feather is described by dozens of parallel lines, providing remarkable detail and naturalistically textured color. Engraving with original hand color.

    "text": "ELH tried this matter in Bloomington before Arbitrator Falcioni on October 13, 2005 and November 14, 2005. The Arbitrator ruled in favor of the Respondent with respect to all issues in all cases. The Arbitrator refused to accept the Petitioner\u2019s allegation that she suffered an accidental injuries arising out of and in the course of her employment. He further denied benefits on the basis of causal relationship. No benefits were awarded in any of the cases.\nThrough effective cross-examination of the Petitioner, Ed Hennessy established the specific time, place and occurrence of alleged accident. Then, with compelling security camera videotape and other information gathered by company investigators, proved conclusively that the alleged accident did not occur where, when and how the Petitioner said it did. The Arbitrator specifically found the Petitioner not to be credible at her testimony to be \u201ccompletely controverted by the evidence in the record\u201d.\nEd Hennessy tried this matter in 2007. Arbitrator Fratanni adopted his argument in all respects and denied compensation in its entirety. In her Order she concluded that the Petitioner failed to prove that she sustained accidental injuries which arose out of and in the course of her employment, that she further failed to prove that she gave Respondent timely notice and that she failed to prove that her condition of ill-being is causally related to any accidental injury allegedly sustained at work.\nTried in 2007; Arbitrator O\u2019Malley incorporated all arguments asserted by Ed Hennessy in his decision. As proposed, the Arbitrator denied the petitioner\u2019s claim for wage differential under Section 8(d)1, he denied more than 28 weeks of demanded TTD, he awarded medical as proposed (allowing credit for medical expenses paid by group insurance) and he denied the claim for penalties and fees.\nEd Hennessy successfully defended Petitioner\u2019s claim for permanent total disability benefits and further limited Respondent\u2019s liability for TTD and PPD benefits substantially. Established with videotape and testimonial evidence, that the Respondent offered a reasonable accommodation and that the Petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with a bid process demonstrated the Petitioner\u2019s lack of diligence in attempting a return to work.\nEd Hennessy tried this matter in Bloomington before Arbitrator Falcioni in June of 2004. The case involved an altercation between co-employees. At issue was whether the altercation had its origin in the work or the manner in which it was to be performed and whether the Petitioner could be characterized as the aggressor. Arbitrator Falcioni held the injury to be compensable and awarded permanency for a left ankle fracture and over $11,000.00 in medical expenses. The Respondent challenged the decision on review. Although the Commission affirmed Arbitrator\u2019s findings as to accident, causal relationship and permanency, it remanded the matter to the Arbitrator for determination of whether the record would support the award for medical expenses. Respondent contended that the evidence offered by the Petitioner at trial was insufficient to establish medical expense liability pursuant to Section 8(a) on the basis of reasonableness, necessity or causal relationship. Ed Hennessy negotiated a compromise of the disputed sum in a settlement contract subsequent to the remand.\nThis individual underwent invasive surgery referable to the shoulder and to the lower spine in connection with injuries that he allegedly sustained on three different dates. Ed Hennessy tried and won this matter before Arbitrator Lee in August 2006 in defense of Petitioner\u2019s allegation that he is permanently and totally disabled and in defense of the Petitioner\u2019s demand for more than 2 1/2; years of accrued TTD benefits.\nEd Hennessy tried this matter before Arbitrator White in Urbana on February 16, 2005. Arbitrator White decided in favor for the Respondent, denying compensation on the basis that the Petitioner did not sustain an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment. Arbitrator White ruled that the Petitioner failed to trace her injury or condition to a definite time, place or cause. Further, no reliable medical evidence was offered to plausibly explain how any work she performed for the Respondent could have caused or aggravated her underlying herniated disc problem.\nArbitrator Lee heard this matter pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act and limited his rulings to accident, causal relationship and award for TTD and medical. Arbitrator Lee ruled in favor of the Petitioner on issues of accident and causal relationship. Necessarily, he awarded TTD that accrued as well as medical expenses of $765.39. In awarding the benefits, the Arbitrator ignored evidence at the Petitioner had worked for three subsequent employers before proceeding with thumb surgery. The matter was resolved on a compromised basis contractorily after the Respondent elected not to pursue an appeal.\nEd Hennessy tried this matter before Arbitrator Lee on March 15, 2006. Arbitrator Lee adopted Respondent\u2019s proposed decision in its entirety, awarding 30% loss of the right hand and acknowledging a credit owed to the Respondent in the amount of $9,328.52 for overpaid TTD. The Petitioner secured modification on appeal, but Respondent retained credit for over $5,000.00.\nPetitioner\u2019s attorney pressed for a Section 19(b) trial of this case before Arbitrator Lee on September 2, 2005. Although Arbitrator Lee ruled against the Respondent and additionally awarded penalties, Petitioner\u2019s attorney committed many mistakes, one in particular potentially costing his client more than $22,000.00 in medical expenses. Of particular significance, Petitioner\u2019s attorney failed to introduce evidence at the first Section 19(b) trial. Petitioner\u2019s attorney attempted to offer the records in the second 19(b) trial, but the arbitrator sustained our objection on the basis of res judicata. Based upon that leverage, we were able to reach a reasonable settlement with Petitioner\u2019s attorney, which did not include the awarded penalties.\nThe Petitioner in this case suffered from a congenital spine condition which caused her brain stem to slip into her neck. Despite evidence offered to the contrary, the Arbitrator found that the Petitioner\u2019s job aggravated her underlying conditions resulting in significant permanency. The award though was kept in terms of permanency rather than permanent total disability as was included in the Petitioner\u2019s prayer. The Respondent elected to pay the award and close the case. The Petitioner also chose not to appeal.\nHighly favorable outcome in 2007, achieved largely from very careful factual investigation and the assembly of reliable witnesses. Petitioner reluctantly agreed on the date of trial to close the case pertaining to a van accident that the Respondent had denied based upon numerous inconsistencies.",

    "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A few weeks ago, we ran a provocative piece by Stephen Watts and Sean Mann in which they argued that in both its politics and in its development, Afghanistan is doing better than is commonly believed. Gary Owen, a civilian development worker who has spent the last several years working on the ground in Afghanistan, begs to differ. He paints a far gloomier picture of Afghanistan, arguing that the country and U.S. policy have a long way to go.\nMany Americans are surprisingly bullish on Afghanistan, and this perspective showed up in a July Lawfare post on \u201cAfghanistan After the Drawdown\u201d by RAND analysts Stephen Watts and Sean Mann. Although the two authors offer some valid points, they miss many of the country\u2019s problems and, in so doing, are wrongly optimistic about where Afghanistan is going.\nAfter a decade and more of U.S. intervention, it can be difficult to pin down how things are going in Afghanistan. By some measures, things in Afghanistan are better: There are more children in school than there were under the Taliban, more Afghans have access to basic healthcare than before the 2001 invasion, and Internet access means more connections to the outside world than was ever possible during the time of the black turbans. Watts and Mann cite those cases as reasons to be optimistic about the country, and rightly so. Where they go wrong is in three key areas: relations with Pakistan, the current government as a symbol of Afghan unity, and the abilities of Afghan security forces.\nPakistan\u2019s got plenty to worry about when it comes to sanctuaries within its own borders, a grim point made by last year\u2019s school shooting in Peshawar. And recent revelations that Mullah Omar died in Pakistan, and his whereabouts were known to the ISI for years, don\u2019t paint a picture of Afghanistan being used as a base to launch operations against Pakistan. Instead it speaks to Pakistan\u2019s harboring of the Taliban with the government\u2019s knowledge, something Islamabad is scrambling to correct as they look ahead to peace talks with the Taliban.\nOr it\u2019s just a case of Afghanistan following the American lead.\nIn the fall of 2014, after another runoff election threatened to bring the country\u2019s democratic future to a grinding halt, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed a group made up of Abdullah\u2019s leadership team. According to an administration official, Kerry told the group, \u201cI have to emphasize to you that if you do not have an agreement, if you do not move to a unity government, the United States will not be able to support Afghanistan.\u201d Aimed squarely at those who supported Abdullah to the point that they might take up arms in his name, Kerry\u2019s statement was an offer neither Ghani nor Abdullah could possibly refuse. The current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThe current government isn\u2019t a triumph of consensus so much as it is a case study in diplomatic extortion, and its survival is doubtful if the Americans stick with the current timeline for complete withdrawal by the end of 2016.\nThanks to advances by the Taliban in Faryab and Kunduz, influential politicians like Rashid Dostum (currently Ghani\u2019s vice president) and Atta Noor (the powerful governor of Balkh province) have been pretty vocal in their thinking that Afghan forces alone can\u2019t get the job done; that to tip the balance means more troops from somewhere\u2014either the Americans (not out of the question completely, but unlikely), or some kind of militia. Since today\u2019s anti-Taliban militia could be tomorrow\u2019s coup attempt, it lays some troubling groundwork for widening existing divides in the country that the United States had hoped the Ghani/Abdullah deal would help bridge. Unless they can manage to bring the security situation that\u2019s deteriorating faster than Iggy Azalea\u2019s career back under control, Afghan troops could have some new bosses very soon. Their current performance doesn\u2019t inspire much hope.\nActually, it\u2019s pretty clear how those forces will perform. In a word? Badly.\nSince the Afghans assumed control of the country\u2019s security in 2014, more civilians have been killed, more soldiers have died, more Afghan troops have deserted than ever before, and security forces are still torturing one-third of their detainees. This is the force Watts and Mann describe as \u201cpassably capable\u201d and \u201cresilient.\u201d If by \u201cpassably capable\u201d they mean \u201cdoesn\u2019t torture too many people,\u201d then sure, I suppose they are \u201cpassably capable,\u201d but I think we might want to aim just a bit higher.\nAccording to the Americans, civilian casualties as a result of ground engagements between the Afghans and insurgents were up eight percent for the first three months of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. In June, Afghan Chief of Army Staff Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem told his troops that using artillery and conducting night raids against the insurgents was just fine, and no one would be prosecuted as a result. Since most engagements occur among the population when one is countering an insurgency, this change in the rules of engagement means more innocent civilians are going to die as the result of actions by Afghan security forces. That\u2019s borne out by the latest report on civilian casualties from UNAMA, which found that throughout the first half of 2015, Afghan forces caused more civilian casualties than the Taliban did.\nAnd when they\u2019re not busy leveling villages, Afghan forces are dying in record numbers. Throughout the first five months of 2015, security forces casualties were up 70 percent from the same period in 2014. Some of that\u2019s attributable to increasing activity by the insurgents, but a \u201ccapable\u201d force doesn\u2019t see that kind of casualty increase unless its capabilities are less than optimal. Even so, the biggest cause of attrition for Afghan troops isn\u2019t being killed in action (KIA). According to a June report by the Americans to Congress, the largest source for attrition is \u201cdropped from rolls\u201d (wherein a soldier stops showing up for work for more than a month so he\u2019s no longer counted), and KIA is the smallest source for Afghan force attrition.\nBut when they do manage to not die and to show up for work, Afghan forces like to spend some quality time with their detainees. A February report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that while torture is on the decrease, around 35 percent of all detainees surveyed reported being tortured in detention. Much of that alleged torture was at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is similar to the FBI, except that the FBI has better windbreakers and isn\u2019t prone to hooking people up to car batteries unnecessarily. That probably explains why the Americans made it clear in June that no U.S. funds were going to the NDS, even though nearly every other aspect of Afghan defense operations comes directly from American coffers and internal defense is vital for the success of the counterinsurgency.\nIn an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nAn American solution to Afghanistan\u2019s problems faces the struggles of a dwindling security force to keep the Taliban at bay as they strike from sanctuaries in Pakistan, a government on the verge of collapse, and large numbers of civilians being victimized by their own government. And that\u2019s without the growing threat of the Islamic State. In an alternate-reality Afghanistan, civilians aren\u2019t dying in greater numbers, the government isn\u2019t on the verge of collapse, and the return on foreign investment is staggering. The Afghans would love it\u2014because that\u2019s the country the Americans promised them.\nThe reality is that that Afghanistan\u2019s future, while grim, is still better than it was. There is cause for cautious optimism. That does not mean that we shouldn\u2019t be painfully honest about what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan. Given the sacrifices made since 9/11, it\u2019s tempting to do otherwise. But doing so means ignoring challenges the country faces, and the decisions about its future the Americans still need to make.",

    "text": "This past weekend, we took a trip with D's parents to a distillery. In fact, it is the only whiskey distillery in the state! Sons of Liberty opened in 2011, and originally released a whiskey and they called it Uprising. D's dad had picked some up last summer for D's bachelor party, and it was such a smooth whiskey, and they really enjoyed it.\nSo, when we first got to the distillery, we were greeted by Danny, who is the sales manager, but also does tours when he's not on the road. He showed us through the distillery, which actually isn't that big, but the key thing to it is that it is efficient. Danny explained that they make their whiskey from beer. He showed us the four types of hops that they use to brew the beer, and explained that the only difference between the four types is how long they are roasted, similar to coffee beans.\nNext, he had us open up the lids to the holding containers, where the beer was fermenting. The first container had such a strong smell, almost like tequila, but that's because it hadn't been distilled a second time yet. The second container was really cool, because it smelled like beer, and you could actually see the active yeast on the top fermenting the beer.\nNext on the tour was the roasting pot, where they roast the hops to get the flavors that they want, and then add in the water to start the distilling process.\nNext, we were shown the actual still where the whiskey is made. The thing is huge, and was custom designed by the owner of Sons of Liberty, Michael, and the company that he designed the still with is now selling them on the floor. As you can tell from the picture below, the still is large enough to actually get into, which they do every so often for cleaning. The four windows that you see on the pipe allow you to see the level of which the liquid is at, and there are gauges all over the different pipes so that they can read the levels of alcohol.\nDanny also talked with us about how they make their vodka, which is done using the same machines that they use to make the whiskey. For their flavored vodkas, they use all natural ingredients and actually do all of the work themselves. One of their flavored vodkas is Mint Cucumber, and they sat around together and zested over 500 cucumbers by hand and de-stemmed mint leaves just to create the flavor. They were actually asking if we knew of any different cucumber recipes that they could use because after their zesting parties, they have all these unused cucumber cores and don't know what to do with them!\nAfter our tour was over, we went up to the bar to do the tasting. You may know that I'm not really a drinker, so I was unsure of how much I would enjoy the process. But, I really enjoyed it. The bartender, Brian, was great, and was so helpful in giving us information about the different spirits.\nWe tried the Uprising Whiskey, which we had all already had before, and while it was too strong for my liking, since I don't really do hard alcohols, especially whiskey, it was smoother than others I have had before.\nWe were also told about the different seasonal spirits that they make. Last year, they made a Single Malt Whiskey, and sold all 900 bottles that they made. Another seasonal flavor that they created was the Pumpkin Spice Whiskey which was apparently also a really big hit. Danny, the salesman, told us that as of three weeks ago, there were only 4 bottles left in the state! I was really looking forward to trying that one, since I love pumpkin, but they didn't even have a bottle for themselves!\nAfter the whiskies, we moved onto the vodkas. I'm not a huge fan of vodka, but I must say that I did really enjoy these. The regular vodka was strong, but still was good. The seasonal vodkas, however, were my favorite. The first one was the Mint Cucumber Vodka, which I mentioned previously. You really get a strong cucumber flavor at the first taste, but the after taste is where the mint comes in. It's such a fresh taste, especially for me not liking cucumber! Brian told us that making a mojito with this vodka would be perfect because of the mint, but would also add a little surprise in there with the cucumber flavoring.\nThe second vodka was my absolute favorite! It's Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Bean Vodka. The smell of it is just so chocolatey, but the after taste is where you really get the vanilla flavor. Danny wanted us to taste it in a mixed drink, so he ended up taking some and mixing it up with Rum Chata, which is a Caribbean Rum with real Dairy Cream. When you originally smell it, it smells like carrot cake, which I just happen to love. The Rum Chata really brought out the vanilla flavor, and it was absolutely delicious! I loved it, and ended up taking D's too, since he's not a fan of carrot cake, and didn't really enjoy the combination.\nThat was the last drink that we sampled, and our experience at Sons of Liberty was awesome. We will definitely be going back, because the staff and experience were awesome! Part of the tasting was the Sons of Liberty glass, which has already gotten great use, because I went to the liquor store the next day and stocked up. I got a bottle of the Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Bean Vodka, and a small bottle of the Rum Chata, so I could make my own drinks.\nWhile I was at the liquor store, I also walked over to the whiskey section and as I was browsing, I found the Pumpkin Spice whiskey sitting on the top shelf! We were told that this liquor store was one of the ones that still had it, but given that those numbers were accurate three weeks ago, I was skeptical that it would still be on the shelf. We really lucked out though! We ended up trying that one out too, and it was really good! I'm looking forward to Fall so I can enjoy some seasonal drinks with it.\nSo that was our trip to the distillery. If any of you are local or will be traveling through the area, I highly recommend that you check this place out. I doubt that you will be disappointed.\nI have been excited to paint rooms since before the day we started looking at houses. Painting your house just helps so much to make it more personal and feel homey. I tend to do all of my house planning on my computer or iPad, but with paint colors, you really should do that with paint chips, as monitor lighting can change the look of a color drastically.\nBut, since I'm so technology obsessed, I did a little of both. Knowing what colors I wanted to use, I checked out the Sherwin-Williams website and started picking out colors that I knew I wanted to use. You have already seen the Family Room design plan, so you know that I picked those colors out a while back.\nAlready having this room set, I knew that choosing the other colors for the first floor had to be done carefully, since the purple and the yellow are so bold. To make the color choices really easy to see, I decided to insert them onto the floor plan of the house. This is really helpful when choosing paint colors for your house, because you don't want all of the colors that you choose to end up clashing or looking terrible.\nThere were some things that I already knew what color I wanted, so those were easy. I new that I wanted gray and orange in my craft room, which will be in the smaller bedroom. That was an easy choice. Next was the front door, and after seeing the picture below, I knew I had to have a deep purple door. And the plus side of having a purple door is that it will match with the new paint on the exterior of the house, the new roof, and the stone work that is currently on the outside of the house.\nA common color that will be used throughout the house, in both furniture and paint, is white. Unfortunately, that doesn't help narrow down many color choices for us, so I thought about things that inspired me. I found a navy blue duvet cover at Target while I was picking up the side table for the Family Room, and since it was on clearance, I bought it. This ended up becoming the inspiration piece for the navy blue, green, and white color palette in the bigger bedroom in the corner, which will end up being a guest bedroom.\nTo match with the front door, I wanted a lighter contrasting color, so I decided to go with two different shades of green, and I have plans to do vertical stripes along both hallways above the chair molding and paneling. The full bathroom on this floor is almost entirely brown, which I think needs to change. So I chose a beautiful shade of teal that I think will complement the space and design perfectly.\nThe last room on this floor was the Living Room. Since this space is so huge, we plan to use it as both a living area and a more formal dining area. I had originally picked out a light blue and a dark coral for this room, but after lining everything up on the floor plan, I realized that the coral color really clashed with the orange. So, after pulling some colors that I have already used in other rooms, I finally found the color palette for the entire first floor.\nI know there are a lot of colors there, but I'm not afraid of it being too much. I'm just so excited to start painting and decorating. I can't wait to actually be proud to show off our home!\nA few months back, I got a call at work from my mom, who was at home, and she said that the fire alarms had gone off three times so far that morning. Apparently when they decide to go off, they not only make that annoying and loud beeping noise, but there's also a woman's voice that starts saying \"fire\" over and over again. Except she doesn't say it like you and I would normally. She really emphasizes the second syllable, so it's more like \"fi-YER.\" Kind of funny, actually. But anyways, the fire department came and checked everything out, and cleared the house, saying that there were no fire or carbon monoxide issues.\nThe fire alarms didn't go off again... until my dad got home from work a few hours later. My dad did some investigating, and found that one of the smoke/carbon detectors seemed to be the one triggering the others, so he took it down, and that seemed to have stopped the problems.\nI called our electrician and he came over and took a look at the system and realized that not all of the detectors were linked into the same electrical system, which is apparently required for insurance purposes. Also, there were no detectors in any of the bedrooms, and some of them were battery operated.\nWe ended up scheduling a time for him to rewire the fire alarms, and add in new ones where they were needed, and we hadn't had any issues since then.\nI was at work once again, so my mom and my sister did some investigating, and there was one that was triggering the others again. They disconnected it from the ceiling and the others haven't triggered on again, so it looks like we have another culprit. I'm going to have to buy a replacement at the hardware store this weekend to see if that solves some problems.\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? Are we doing the right thing by unplugging the culprit? It just makes me nervous because it doesn't seem like those things should just go off without there being an issue, you know? Help!\nYou've heard me mention a few times before that we have a great desire to renovate our kitchen. But, that's at least two years down the line, as there are other things that we would like to get done first. In the meantime, however, we want to do something that makes it look a little better and to personalize it a bit. The thing that I hate the most about our kitchen is the backsplash. It's this really ugly peach colored ceramic tile that has a few printed tiles laid into the design. Some of them have wine bottles and grapes on them, and that is definitely not our style.\nI started researching cheap and easy alternatives to change this out, as we don't want something that will be too involved or expensive, as it will likely be changed again in a few years when we completely renovate the kitchen. I looked at a few different materials.\nThe first one that I found was AirStone. AirStone is a product that is made from recycled materials, and is meant to look like actual stones. They come in a variety of sizes, and adhere to the surface that you want to place them on via an adhesive mortar. These look awesome, but for the amount that we would need, it would be just over $100, and while that is still really inexpensive, it was more than we wanted to spend.\nThe second material that I looked at was Tin Ceiling Tiles, which are also adhesive. These come in great textures, colors, and patterns, but the price for a single tile was way more expensive than we wanted. Plus, I wasn't so sure about how good a shiny metal backsplash would look against a matte finish Corian countertop.\nThe last material I found was vinyl floor tile. With the vinyl floor tile, you have the option of going with a solid color, or choosing one with dimension and different textures. Another benefit of the vinyl was that it was cheap, it was adhesive, like the other materials, and it didn't require additional caulking.\nWith this in mind, we went over to Lowes this weekend and picked out a few different colors and patterns and bought sample tiles to bring home and test against the cabinets and countertops. The samples are actually real tiles, which you can purchase from as little as $.88 or as much as $2.25. We ended up coming home with 7 different tiles, and chose which one we were going to go with less than two minutes after leaning them up over the existing backsplash.\nThe one that we ended up choosing was the most expensive one, of course. Everything that I like always ends up costing a million dollars, but in this case, we're still going to end up right where we wanted to be budget wise. Even though these tiles are $2.25 each, they are 18\"x18\", instead of 12\"x12\", Which means that we won't need to buy as many cases and there will be much less cutting involved since the height of our backsplash is 18\".\nSo, you can see that the tile has a lot of gray, so it will go with the white cabinets and the stainless steel appliances, but it also has some tans and browns in it, so it will go with the countertops, too. We have plans to paint this room this summer, so the gray that we have chosen for that will match as well.\nWhat do you think? Do you think this small change will make a drastic difference in our kitchen? I am so looking forward to doing this, and don't worry, I'll make you all a DIY!!\nWhen D and I moved back to RI from Indiana, we sold our living room furniture, and trashed the 23+ year old couch and love seat that were gifted to us from D's parents. They had seen much better days! We were going to be living with them, and didn't need living room furniture, plus, most of the stuff was hand-me-down and mismatched anyways.\nI recently sat down and started brainstorming how to furnish and decorate the Family Room, which will be the first priority when they move out. I am really inspired by The High Low Project, on HGTV, where the host, Sabrina Soto decorates a room with no budget, and then tries to recreate it for under the budget set by the homeowners, which is typically around $3-5K. Considering that we are starting with absolutely nothing, no couch, no chairs, and no TV, we are going to try to stay under $4K for the whole project.\nHere's what I've come up with so far!\nI fell in love with the Henry set from West Elm, but the three pieces that we wanted, the couch, oversized chair, and ottoman, would immediately be more than half the budget! After searching high and low for some modern looking gray living room furniture, I finally found a really nice looking set at a local furniture store, called Bob's Discount Furniture.\nWhat you need to know next is that I have an obsession with IKEA. It's bad, and I know it. Admitting that is the first step though, right?\nAnyways, this room wouldn't be complete without something from IKEA, and there will be plenty, but the first piece will be an Expedit. I know. Everyone has one. But, we're going to use it as a TV stand, and I'm going to hack it. I have plans to remove the middle divider on the top row so we have a place to put the TV receiver/DVR, and I also plan to add legs to it so that the TV is a little higher off the ground.\nAs I was searching for rugs, I came across this absolutely gorgeous and dark purple color, and immediately knew that I wanted that in the room. It's a high pile rug, which I am kind of concerned about with having cats, but I think it will be alright.\nYou may have seen this pin on Pinterest, and I knew that I wanted to recreate that look. But, I searched and searched, and couldn't find any metal trash cans that were pretty enough to do this, so I started looking at actual side tables and found this one from Target! Later, after some research, I found out that the table in the inspiration picture is actually a table from Target and not a trash can, so I guess it was meant to be.\nI have plans to spray paint it our accent color - primary yellow!\nLastly, a few DIY projects. I love love love the look of poufs, but I really do not like the price tag at all. So, I'm going to DIY my own. It will also be primary yellow, although I am having a hard time finding thick enough and cheap enough yarn or something to make it from. I was recently thinking about how I could use rope, or even a bedsheet though. We'll see what I decide.\nWe currently have a 2' wall clock in the family room, but it's a much more traditional style, and we're looking for something a bit more modern. Without getting into the hundreds of dollars, we are going to DIY our own clock, which will end up being just over 3' in diameter. We're going to base it on this design, but make some modifications to it that we think would better fit our space.\nThere are more pieces of furniture that we have chosen, and some accessories, but this is the plan for the most part. Also, for the DIY items, I'll be sure to write up the directions and do a post for each one. I'm really excited for the project! So excited, in fact, that I put everything into Photoshop to see how it would look together.\nI think it's looking awesome so far! I can't wait to actually get it started! What do you think?\nNow that you've seen the Master Bedroom in our house, you can tell that I had a major dilemma on my hands. There are four double-windows in the bedroom, one in the closet, and one in the bathroom plus the bay window above the hot tub. If you add all of those up, that means that I would need 9 curtain rods, and 18 brackets. Curtains were a must, as we have neighbors that can see in the windows at night when the lights are on. Also, they make the room look nice!\nSo, looking online, I quickly figured out that it was going to cost me well over $200 dollars just for curtain rods, and I was actually looking at more like $300 for the style that I wanted.\nNow, I'm a major DIY-er, so I immediately tried to come up with ideas as to how I could make this a cheap and fun project. So, I did some research and decided to make my own curtains AND brackets!\nI took a trip to Lowes with my dad, and borrowed my sister's SUV, and we bought the supplies.\nFirst, we went to the Electrical aisle, and took a look at the electrical conduit. It was going to work perfectly. Now, you have some options in size when buying conduit for your curtain rods. They come in 1/2\", 3/4\" and 1\" diameters. I ended up choosing the 1\", which is slightly more expensive, but would look better with the size of the grommets in the curtains I was eyeing.\nNext, we went to the pipe-fittings aisle, and I got all the parts for the brackets. All I needed were conduit hooks (make sure you get the ones that are made for the diameter of conduit you chose). Lastly, was the hardware aisle, where I picked up some wing-nuts, some metal screws, and some \"L\" brackets. The \"L\" brackets should come with their own mounting screws. Make sure you keep those, because that's what you'll attach these to the wall with.\nOnce we got home, it was assembly time!\nI started with the brackets. I got all my stuff together, and then got to work.\nEach bracket will be made of one of each of the items listed above. So, I took one of each item from my supplies, and started putting them together.\nTake the conduit hook and line up the screw hole on the flat part with one of the screw holes on the end of the \"L\" bracket. Put your screw through to hold them together.\nAttach your wing-nut to the other side of the screw and start winding it up to tighten the screw around the two pieces.\nYou may want to use a pair of pliers to tighten the wing-nut as much as possible.\nAnd that's that! One bracket down and now 17 to go! Really quick though!\nNow, I'll show you the curtain rods. It makes it really easy to cut the pipe if you have the ability to anchor it down, so what D and I did was bring it outside, and lay it diagonally across two chairs, and then we each sat down on an end. We had measured out how long we needed the first part of the pipe to be for one of the windows, and I marked it with permanent marker. We took the conduit cutter, placed the blade on the mark, and started twisting around the pipe.\nYou can see how we stopped mid-cut so I could show you the indentation that the cutter was making. Depending on the brand, your cutter may tell you otherwise, but we tightened the blade after every rotation, and after less than two minutes, we had made our first clean cut.\nAfter we made all the cuts, we brought the pipes upstairs, made marks on the wall where we wanted the brackets to be, and screwed them into the wall using two screws from the \"L\" bracket package. I took the curtains that I bought and hemmed, looped them onto the pipes, and then clipped our electrical conduit curtain rods into place.\nThese curtain rods will not have finials, as you may have noticed, but you can get creative and use just about anything as finials. We have plans to spray paint wooden balls and attach them to the end of ours, but you could also buy normal curtain finials and attach them, or even use grapevine balls, painted different colors (I actually plan to do this in another room in my house!).\nAnd now for the final reveal!\nOpen curtains - with massive glare!\nSo, the grand total for this project. Ready? Less than $80! Yes! For real! I spent less than $80 on everything I needed for this project. Totally awesome, especially considering I had 9 curtain rods and 18 brackets to make!\nNow, go out to your local hardware store and save yourself some money!\nOk, so you've seen the first floor and the second floor of our house. Now it's time to see the last part, the basement and the yard.\nThe basement was fully finished at one point, but as of right now, it is no longer. We purchased the house with knowledge that there were some mold issues in the basement because of a previous water issue, so we've had to do some work down there to get rid of the mold. The basement was high priority on our list when we first purchased the house, but it's kind of taken a back burner now.\nBut, here we go! Like I did with the rest of the house, here is a floor plan of the basement. I didn't have Microsoft Visio with me at the time, so I used Microsoft Word and made a legend at the bottom that explains what each thing is.\nWhen you walk down the stairs to the basement from the hallway on the first floor, you come down into the open space in the basement. The area is really, really big, measuring at just about 700 square feet! There is an area closer to the utility room and there is also an area where there is a door that leads up a steep flight of stairs to the backyard.\nBehind the stairs that go up to the main floor, there is a closet, which is really oddly shaped, but has a bookshelf in it, in addition to the deeper storage space that actually runs underneath the staircase.\nYou can see in the floor plan above that there is actually a bedroom down here too. The bedroom is a really good size, and just to give you an idea of it's placement, it is directly underneath the bigger bedroom on the first floor of the house. The bedroom even has a small walk-in closet, but the doors are currently removed for mold remediation. When the time comes, I'll paint them white to match the rest of the moulding and then hang them back up.\nThrough the doorway next to the shower stall is the laundry room, which is actually a really good size. There is a folding table and a space for the washer and dryer. There are no appliances in the pictures below, but you can see in the floor plan above where they are currently located. Eventually, we'd like to change the water line and electrical for the washer and dryer and get them closer to each other, but that's not absolutely necessary right now, so we're living with the current layout.\nAnd that's it for the basement. So, we'll move onto the back yard. While the property is small, at just about 1/4 acre, it's the perfect size for us without being too much work. The backyard is so cute though.\nFirst, the door from the basement looks like this. Please keep in mind that the house has been completely repainted now, and that these pictures are from before we closed on the property.\nTo the right of this picture is the small yard part of the backyard. The yard is completely fenced in, and has great arborvitaes along most of the fence for added privacy.\nYou can tell from the last picture that I was standing on the deck, so now I'll show you what that looks like. The deck is really cute. It's not that high off the ground, which I like, and it has a built-in bench that goes around on two sides for additional seating. I think for safety's sake, we're going to build a back for the bench, and then I'll make some outdoor cushions for comfort.\nNow that the house is painted, we also have plans to paint the deck, as the two different shades of gray don't go together very well, and we want to brighten up the space a little bit.\nWhen standing on the deck and looking straight ahead into the yard, we have a non-fruit producing pear tree, which is absolutely gorgeous. This picture also shows two of the three additional Poplar trees growing along the fence, but we had all three of them removed because not only were they breaking the fence, but they were so tall and hanging over our back-neighbor's house, and we didn't want that liability.\nI can't wait to see this pear tree in bloom this Spring!\nI know that I have shown you some pictures of the front of the house before, but these show off a bit more of the landscaping, which will all likely be changed in the Spring. There are a lot of shrubs right along the house and not only are they not very attractive, but they also are too close to the siding and are causing problems, so we'll be taking care of that soon too.\nSome of these pictures were also taken before the house was painted and the roof was replaced, so please keep that in mind.\nThis next picture is of the kitchen addition and front porch by the driveway. You can really see how overgrown the bushes and shrubs are along this part of the house.\nThis next picture is of the corner of the original part of the house and the addition. Again, needs weeding badly, and some grooming overall.\nI know that the stone on the house looks very brown, but it's not actually that brown. When you look closer, there is a lot of gray, and some dark purples too, which is why we decided to go with a darker gray paint color for the wood siding. I actually really love the stone facade.\nAnd now for the front of the house. This first picture is before the painting and roof were done.\nDuring.... Painting done, roofing not.\nThis concludes our house tour! What do you think? I am so glad that we decided to get the house painted and the roof redone. It makes it look so much better right off the bat. Now for all the other projects that we want to accomplish! The list never ends when you're a homeowner, right?!",

    "text": "The primary intent of this thesis is to present a political descriptive analysis of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), and urban revolutionary movement active in the 1960's. An attempt has been made to portray the historical context, the organization, ideology of the RAM organization and response of the state to the activities of the organization.\nThe thesis presents a methodological approach to developing a paradigm in which the study of urban revolutionary movements is part of a rational analysis. The thesis also explains concepts and theories that are presented later in the text. A review of black radical activity from 1900 to 1960 is given to provide the reader with historical background information of the events and personalities which contributed to the development of RAM. A comparative analysis is made between urban revolutionary movements in Latin America and the United States in order to show that the RAM organization was part of a worldwide urban phenomenon.\nThe scope of the thesis is to present an analysis of the birth, early beginnings of RAM as a national organization, and Malcolm X's impact on the organization. The thesis also covers RAM's organizational activities in two phases, including the dissolution of the organization. The basic tenets of RAM's ideology are examined in the thesis along with an analysis of repression waged against the organization by governmental intelligence agencies. The thesis concludes with a critical analysis of RAM as an organizational model in the black freedom struggle.\nStanford, Maxwell C., \"Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM): a case study of an urban revolutionary movement in western capitalist society\" (1986).

    "text": "Kristin Wilson, MA, LPC, Vice President of Clinical Outreach at Newport Academy.\nMay is Mental Health Awareness Month, and Pulse is taking a look at the issues by speaking with experts. Kristin Wilson is the vice president of clinical outreach at Newport Academy, a rehabilitation center based in Connecticut that has been treating teens with mental health issues, trauma, eating disorders and substance abuse for 10 years. Wilson, who has been working there for nearly three years, spoke about helping teens heal and the stigma that still surrounds mental illness.\nI didn\u2019t take my first psychology class until my senior year in college. I was fascinated by the chemistry of the brain, by the development at both infancy and adolescence. And I really loved the idea of working with teenagers and empowering them to make better decisions at a time where there is so much neural plasticity happening in their brain\u2014when all those new channels and pathways are being developed.\nAt Newport Academy, we work with teenagers and young adults, ages 12-20. They come from all over the country to stay with us for 30-90 days. We see a lot of depression, a lot of anxiety, a lot of attachment relational issues. We see some eating disorders, we see substance abuse issues. On average we are dealing with underlying mental health issues probably 100 percent of the time regardless of what a child is classified as when they come in.\n20 percent of people aged 13-18 have a mental health condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. And about 50 percent of high school students with a mental illness drop out. Depression is one of the most common\u2014the National Institute of Mental Health reported that about 3.1 million youth aged 12 to 17 suffered from at least one major depressive episode in 2016.\nOne of the things that we see with teenagers specifically is that there is still a real stigma around having mental health problems and it can really cause people who are suffering to not seek out help. They are fearful that if they do they are going to get judged and for a teenager to be judged by peers or by others can be really difficult.\n75 to 80 percent of youth who need help in the United States don\u2019t receive mental health services.\nOur program is based on the idea that if we identify and address the underlining trauma, mental health and attachment wounds, we can create an environment where kids are able to connect authentically with themselves, with their peers and with their family. To create authentic connections with self means to know what you love, know what you believe in, know that there\u2019s a world outside of self and learn empathy.\nThen it\u2019s about being able to engage those kids with peers and with their family in that same process. The way that we do that is through clinical programming, creative programming, experimental programming. We also have a focus on academics; we want kids to feel good about themselves and in academic environments, sometimes that can be challenging. We offer very small gender specific classrooms where the kids can really excel academically.\nWe treat the child and the family\u2014they play such a huge role in sustainable healing. We want to make sure that we\u2019re treating the body and mind and spirit of both of them. It\u2019s about creating connections in an environment where conversations\u2014whether they are just general like, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d type of conversations or more specific around difficult subjects\u2014are allowed to flourish and that there\u2019s a place of unconditional love both the child and the parent experience together.\nWe are also noticing that holistic care really does prove to be a positive measure in treatment. Things like nutrition and exercise blended together with traditional clinical psychotherapy and psychopharm agents if needed, I think are really going to be the way of the future. We know that what you put in your body directly impacts neural chemistry and so some of the links between healthy foods, non-processed foods, GMO-free foods have shown in measurable research that they are productive in the body when it comes to increasing serotonin levels. Things like yoga and meditation, those have all been proven to have a big effect on lowering cortisol and increasing those happy chemicals in the brain.\nWe see kids coming in who have really incorporated a sense of self that is impacted by early childhood trauma and attachment wounds. They have this belief that they are not good enough or they are not worthy. One of the most amazing things that I\u2019ve been able to witness is when that belief gets challenged, where they are engaged in something that they love to do and they are really good at it, whether it\u2019s art, photography, music, yoga or hiking. All of sudden, that self belief of \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d goes away.",

    "text": "I have updated my scheduling script for GenCon 2014. I had originally not expected to have to make any changes to the code, but GenCon this year moved the location of their event catalog files, and decided to only release the event catalogs in xlsx format instead of csv. While you can still use last year's version of my scheduler by manually downloading and converting the catalog files, I've modified my code to use a converter utility to do the conversion.\nThe latest version of it can be found here.\nIn order to use this, you will need to install Python 2.7. You will also need to install this xlsx to csv converter code. After installing xlsx2csv, you'll have to copy the xlsx2csv.py file from the install directory into the same directory that the schedule solver python file is located.\nThe GenCon event registration system is also limiting event wish lists to 50 items this year, so the wishlist generator will limit itself to that number of wishlist items.\nAs before, this is an experimental and somewhat crude schedule optimization utility. It allows you to search the event catalog with a text-based interface, add events to your wishlist with assigned priorities, and then generates an optimal schedule for you, as well as a wishlist to enter into the GenCon registration system.\nI don't know why specifically you'd be getting that error if you're using the same xlsx2csv code, since I took the keyword arguments straight from their code, but I've uploaded a new version of the code that omits those arguments (as they don't seem to do anything) and has a few other tweaks. Try downloading it again and trying it.\nGetting this error when trying to use the scheduler for 2016. Any chances of you updating this again?\nI have an updated copy at https://www.dropbox.com/s/ulypjnj53mwbmpx/schedule%20solver%202016.py?dl=0 which seems to work with this year's data.\nHowever, I'm a bit surprised anyone is still using this archaic script, since there are far better options available for doing event search available now.",

    "text": "Why Owners and Tenants need to have Contents Insurance?\nOwners and tenants both have contents in a property so it\u2019s important that both parties are adequately insured to make sure that valuable possessions are protected. Contents insurance covers the financial cost of repairing or replacing possessions if they are damaged or lost and can include items such as furniture, blinds, clothes, fridges, televisions, computers, tools and jewellery. Below is a brief guide on where to start if you\u2019re looking for contents insurance, whether you\u2019re a tenant or property owner.\nAs an owner, you are responsible for any contents in the property, even if the property is not provided furnished. Items like floating floors, carpets, dishwashers and blinds fall under contents, so it\u2019s very important to have these items covered in your building and/or landlord policy. Contents insurance is not just for people who own their own home, it is also important for people renting a home; as a tenant, you are responsible for the contents and belongings that you bring to the property. If the worst should happen, the landlord\u2019s building insurance will only cover the property the landlord owns \u2013 a tenant\u2019s belongings are not included.\nWho is responsible for contents?\nAs a tenant, if you accidentally or intentionally damage the building or contents of the property you are renting, you must notify the agent or owner as soon as possible to ensure correct repairs and insurance procedures can be put in place. You will be expected to pay for repairs or replacement.\nIf the damage is caused by a third party or the event was outside the control of the tenant or owner, for example, a break-in or storm, then each party will be responsible to replace or repair any contents that they own. If the tenant\u2019s belongings are damaged by a building fault such as a ceiling collapsing or roof leak, then a third party will need to determine if the damage was caused by negligence. If the damage was not caused by the owner\u2019s negligence, then the tenant will be responsible for to repair or replace their own contents.\nThe type of insurance you choose will affect the premium you pay (the premium is the price charged by the insurance company for providing the insurance cover). Some policies cover you for defined events (e.g. burglary or fire) while others may cover you for any accidental event. Some policies may even give you limited cover if you take an item (e.g. laptop or mobile phone) outside of your home.\nValuable items may need to be insured for a higher specific value or listed separately under the policy otherwise they might not be covered for their full value or may even be excluded from the claim.\n\u2018New for old\u2019 policies are usually more expensive, so you will need to work out what level of cover you want and weigh up the costs. You may be able to save money on the type of insurance by choosing a higher excess (the excess is the amount of an insurance claim that consumers have to pay). For example, you may choose to pay the first $1000 of any loss, therefore reducing the insurance premium. Bundling is also a great way to save on insurance. Tenants can combine motor vehicle, health and contents policies. For owners, a contents policy is usually covered in a Landlord Protection Policy or you can add it to a building policy.\nIf you require more information, it\u2019s best to speak directly to an insurance company or talk to a few to see who can offer the best deal. You may also like to consider using the services of an insurance broker who will be able to give you information on multiple insurance policies from multiple companies.\nRachael Stevenson is a Property Manager at Empire Estate Agents.

    "text": "Dental implants are the best solution for missing teeth. For over 40 years they have become a dentist\u2019s first choice when replacing missing teeth.\nAn implant is a titanium substitute for a natural tooth root. A socket is usually created into which an implant root is placed, like a wood screw in wood. Unlike wood, however, the bone is dynamic and integrates in to the implant surface. The final result is like a concrete post in concrete and cannot be easily unscrewed. This base is used for crowns, bridges and stabilising dentures.\nHow many teeth can be supported?\nIt is not necessary to use one implant per tooth.\nUsually fewer implants are needed than would be required to treat a whole upper jaw \u2013 A simple treatment plan to provide 10 or more teeth in the lower jaw with as few as four implants is usually possible.\nA loose lower denture can be stabilised with only 2 implants. However, at least 4 implants are needed in the upper jaw.\nImplants are suitable for almost anyone with good general health and properly maintained oral health and hygiene. Smoking, drinking, and neglect of oral hygiene regimes can inhibit initial healing after surgery and maintenance, and cause further complications.\nDo I need to have a healthy mouth?\nFor optimum success, implants should be placed in a well maintained, healthy mouth. Any initial treatment to remedy this, maintenance advice and planning will be included in all treatment plans to achieve the ideal environment for implant placement.\nThe treatment of gum disease, repair of decay and the elimination of infection, or, in summary, basic dental health, will be important for the long-term success of implant treatment.\nFor routine cases, from the insertion of implant to the addition of the first tooth, treatment time scales can be between several weeks and six months. If the bone already present is robust, the treatment time will be shorter. With poorer bone more time and care must be taken, which can extend treatment time beyond six months.\nA bridge supported by natural teeth would be designed in cases where multiple implants need to be routinely joined together in the same way.\nIt is often easier and just as effective to make several smaller sections of bridgework that each support several teeth. The end result is exactly the same and if any repair work is needed on one of the small sections, this is made significantly easier.\nAs with every individual case, bone quality and the position and number of the implants will determine which option is best suited to you and this would be discussed fully and planned at the treatment planning stage.\nHow do I take care of the implants?\nFollowing all stages of implant treatment you will be fully advised on care and maintenance of the implants or the superstructure supported by them. You will be instructed on how to properly clean your implants and what techniques and materials to use in order to satisfactorily achieve this.\nOnce your implants and surrounding soft tissues are seen to be healthy and your new teeth are comfortable and properly fitted, it will be the quality and upkeep of your home care and the regularity of your maintenance reviews that will effectively influence their longevity. If you maintain a high level of care for implants that are expertly placed into healthy, robust bone, they can be expected to endure for many years. There is, however, no lifetime guarantee with any surgical implant \u2013 a doctor would say the same about a hip replacement.\nThe greatest risk is from implant related gum disease.\nX-rays are used to assess and determine the volume and position of bone remaining in an area after tooth loss.\nDental x-rays can provide high definition in two dimensions, but sometimes more advanced imaging might be needed to determine bone volume in three dimensions and the position/proximity of important structures such as nerves and sinuses.\nDental CT Scans \u2013 Images obtained by CT scanning will normally be able to show all of the information about your bone that is required, including quality and quantity, but most significantly to ensure that nerves and other important tissue are avoided during surgery. Roy Morris is one of only a handful of clinics to own our own Cone Beam CT scanner that allows such important images to be taken efficiently and easily.\nIf the teeth being replaced by implants are clearly visible, it is understandable that you would want some teeth during treatment and healing times. We can provide this in the form of temporary bridges or simple plastic dentures.\nImplants are placed using the same familiar dental local anaesthetics used for general, routine dentistry. According to the specifics of the case, the operation might vary from a duration of 20 minutes for a simple single implant to approximately 90 minutes for complex bone grafting and multiple implant procedures.\nSwelling, tenderness and occasionally bruising can be expected after the surgery and full postoperative instructions are given to patients together with antibiotics, if necessary. At our practice, we provide all patients with Roy\u2019s telephone available 24 hours a day should you have any concerns or queries.\nIf my surgery is going to take longer, will I still receive sedation or anaesthetic?\nWhat happens if I don't have enough bone?\nIn some cases, loss of bone after a tooth infection or the removal of teeth leaves them without enough to secure an implant and in such cases bone grafting or sinus augmentation may be required.\nWill bone grafting lengthen my treatment?\nThe treatment time is almost invariably increased when bone grafting is required \u2013 however the process greatly improves the outcome of the implant treatment.\nInitial diagnosis and arranging treatment appointments alongside the completion of any reparative or preparatory work on remaining teeth or bone.\nA \u2018mock up\u2019 will be produced to visualise the final result. Implant placement is then more accurate creating a better appearance in the final teeth.\nYour final, permanent teeth are usually inserted three to nine months after the implants have been inserted.\nTogether with the commitment to a high standard of oral hygiene at home, regular examination and hygiene appointments are then arranged. Hygiene appointments must always be every 3 months.",

    "text": "Hi my name is Alex Eliades and this is my personal blog. I spent most of my life in various parts of the UK but currently I live in Cyprus (now back in London). Im not ashamed to admit that Im a bit of a geek and probably spend far too much time in front of my laptops. I help to run an online Forex and CFD brokerage and own a few websites that I run in my spare time. If Im not working Im generally with the wife, doing DIY or riding my bike in the countryside. Ive had a passion for the Internet ever since it helped radically change my life in the early naughties (2000s) but thats a long story. For some reason I often find myself tinkering around with Linux, web applications, cars or crypto-currencies in my spare time.\nI believe in setting goals, openness, sharing ideas, efficiency, education, honesty, equality, statistics and a long list of other stuff that define who I am. I am an advocate of the paperless office, promoting young people, environmental and social responsibility, giving credit where its due and helping people when I can. In my eyes the most successful people are the ones that can identify strengths in others, then encourage and inspire them to do work they are good at.\nI graduated with a bachelors degree in Business IT from Portsmouth University in the UK, then went on to start a career in software solution sales but after some years realised that it wasn\u2019t my calling in life. The fact that I was a closet techie and developed websites in my spare time was probably a sign that my future didn\u2019t lie in sales. Anyway it was an awesome ride, I travelled all over the UK and met loads of interesting people on the way. The turning point came during my time working at a cool web agency in Tech City, East London with some really inspirational people, not to mention my just as inspirational friends that were close to me back then. During my time there I discovered affiliate marketing, learned a bit about SEO and was surrounded by techies, usability gurus and digital strategists. It was at this point I knew that my future was with the web and I created my first website that produced me a regular income after leaving. I moved to Cyprus, worked for the family business and built up my affiliate business. In 2013 I landed a job doing marketing for an online FX & CFD business. I have worked alongside some industry veterans and learned all I could about this fascinating business. I now work in this field on an outsourced basis while also handling a few personal web projects and I thoroughly enjoy my work.\nMy favourite music includes modern jazz, chill-out, lounge, dance and rock type genres depending on my mood. I used to love watching films but now prefer streaming TV series and my recent favourites include Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Prison Break, The BlackList, The Mentalist, Narcos and Person of Interest. I love being under the sun, outdoors and in a natural environment, especially by (or in) the sea on a hot summers day.\nMy favourite quote is \u201cThere is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self\u201d by Ernest Hemingway. The reason I like it is because I agree we should always look to improve ourselves and not be compelled with comparing ourselves to others.\nLondon is one of the most impressionable places I have lived because the place is alive, full of people at the top of their game and I was lucky enough to have met a load of forward thinking people, which I hope rubbed off on me a bit. Limassol is another massively impressionable City where I lived as my years there helped me understand myself, others and what is really important in life (somethings you just dont learn in London!). Hanoi is another city I visited on numerous occasions and it really woke me up when I saw how people live on the other side of the world.\nI produced this blog so I could keep a journal and share my interests, ideas and experience with the world or at least anyone that is interested enough to read it!",

    "text": "The project \u201cWomen artists for social transformation Xabaca\u201d was born from the collaboration of the NovAct (Barcelona), Al Fanar (Madrid) and Jiwar (Barcelona) association. Xabaca supports female Arab creators for two reasons: their role in social transformation through art, and because of the double oppression they experience as artists and women.\nVery often, cultural creation is a tool to visualize and cross red lines of power structures and to facilitate the questioning of the status quo. Female creators face a very specific type of repression. Patriarchy and the defiance towards the status quo generate a particular form of restraint which affects women in a different way than it affects men. The public and the political role of female creators is reduced, by minimizing the distribution, exposure and advocacy of their products.\nXabaca puts forward the realization of artistic works linked to this whole context, taking into account the importance of gender and repression as fundamental aspects of the defense of freedom of expression and free creation of female Arab artists.\nThus, Jiwar, NovAct and Al Fanar want to give a feedback to society by spreading the word of these artists and contributing to break societal stereotypes around a fixed image of \u201cArab women\u201d.\nXabaca is structured into two different areas: 1) Artistic development: to enhance art and creativity as means to combat gender discrimination, censorship and social injustice. 2) Empowering activist aspects: to strengthen the capacities of the two female Arab artists to increase their role in social change. This will be done by participation in workshops and putting them in touch with the international support network Xabaca, established in 2017.\nOpen call for Arab female artists living and working in MENA region (North Africa \u2013 Middle East). Open to performers and visual artists.\nResidency in Jiwar Creation and Society (Barcelona) from the 1st of November to the 1st of December 2018.\n2 full scholarships covering 100% of the cost of the residency (travel + accommodation), including 450 euros per diem and artist.\nArtistic material covered until 200\u20ac/artist.\nTraining: \u201cArt and social transformation\u201d (3 sessions).\nSend your application to jiwar@jiwarbarcelona.com by July 1st at 0.00h BCN time. Applications can be sent preferably in English and French, but also in Arabic.\n\u2022 Sample of your previous works (website link ok).\nArtists selected in 2017 First edition: Fatima Mortada (visual arts, Lebanon); Sofia Aissaoui & Houda Lakhdar (cinema, Morocco); Haya Zaatry (songwriter, Palestina); Farah Ben Mansour (illustration, Tunisia).",

    "text": "Oregon Duck fans \u2013 and Pac-12 fans, for that matter \u2013 are sick and tired of hearing about how great the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is. Broadcasters constantly speak about how the SEC is ahead of the Pac-12 in recruiting, quality of play and revenue. Well, that no longer appears to be the case.\nThe absence of an SEC team in the 2015 NCAA Football National Championship Game is one reason to believe there\u2019s change coming. However, it may surprise you to know that the Pac-12 made more money than the SEC and the B1G in terms of total revenue during the 2013-14 fiscal year (FY14), according to Steve Berkowitz of USA TODAY Sports.\nThe Pac-12\u2019s revenue nearly doubled from FY13\u2019s $175 million to $334 million in FY14. Berkowitz also reported that Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott remained the nation\u2019s most highly-paid conference CEO, earning just over $3.5 million in total compensation for the 2013 calendar year.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the Pac-12\u2019s total revenues for FY14: Bowl games $41.6 million, NCAA championships $26.3 million, television and media rights $252.7 million, advertising $9 million, investments totaling around $4.2 million \u2013 for a grand total of $333,992,599.\nFor now, the Pac-12 leads all other conferences in revenue. That may change in a few years, due to the SEC\u2019s launch of its own television network with ESPN. However, it\u2019s safe to say that the Pac-12 isn\u2019t content with playing second fiddle to other conferences anymore.",

To address the global and social dimensions of this work, the MDP recently established two tracks. In the Field track, students work on social issues in a real-world context\u2014the first cohort just returned from working at UNICEF\u2019s Innovation Lab in Kampala, Uganda. In the Lab track, students work with emerging ideas from technology and science\u2014they recently worked with a neuroscientist from the Biophotonics Lab at CalTech on a project inspired by new sensing technology from Intel Research.\nAnne Burdick is the author of the influential essay, \u201cGraduate Education: Preparing Designers for Jobs That Don\u2019t Exist (Yet)\u201d in Adobe Think Tank in 2007. A regular participant in the international dialogue regarding research and advanced degrees, Anne believes that it is the job of graduate education to push the field in new directions and to invent new practices. \u201c[Burdick] says that the days of being defined by your mode of output\u2014illustration, web design\u2014will soon be over. \u2018The consideration will be more whether you are a designer who works on issues of a macro scale, such as global warming, or a nano scale, such as molecular design. Education and skills will be about the context of your work\u2014the body, domestic policy\u2014particularly as the boundaries continue to disappear between a physical space, an information space, a gaming space, and so on.\u201d The Future of Design Education, Print Magazine, April 2011.\nIn her own practice, Anne Burdick designs experimental text projects in diverse media, for which she has garnered recognition, from winning the prestigious Leipzig Award for book design to being nominated for a Webby Award for her work with interactive texts and electronic literature. With Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Pressner, and Jeffrey Schnapp, she is a co-author of the book Digital_Humanities, \u201c\u2026a compact, game-changing report on the state of contemporary knowledge production\u201d (MIT Press).

    "text": "On Friday, when discussing the market's miraculous reversal from the worst December since the Great Depression to the best January since 1987 (just a few months prior to Black Monday), we pointed out that \"something strange happened: at a time when stocks had continued to surge of 6 consecutive weeks, investors were not buying it the market's latest miraculous recovery, and according to EPFR, this week saw wildly risk-off flows with $9.4 billion allocated to bonds while $15.0 billion was pulled out of equities.\"\nFurthermore, as Bank of America's Michael Hartnett pointed out in his latest Flow Show, not only were billions pulled out of US equity funds, with outflows on 10 of the past 11 weeks, culminating with $12.1BN in ETF outflows and $2.9BN in mutual funds outflows this week, but US equities have suffered record outflows in the past 3-months, amounting to $82.0BN, equivalent to a whopping 2% of all AUM, i.e. consistent with US equity bearishness at \"events\" & \"big lows\" of past decade.\nWhich prompted us to ask the question: was the recent rally just one giant short squeeze?\nOne look at the recent action in the dramatic surge in the most shorted stocks since the December 24 lows, certainly would suggest that with investors seemingly pulling money out of stocks, the move higher was largely if not entirely due to a panic scramble to cover shorts, due to Mnuchin's appeal to the \"plunge protection team\" on Dec 23, and then to the Fed's dramatic dovish reversal.\nWhile we don't know the answer - yet - we do know that this question of just who it was that bought stocks is puzzling not just us. As Deutsche Bank's Parag Thatte writes in his latest weekly flows report, echoing precisely the question we raised on Friday, while the S&P 500 rallied +15% since late December, equity funds have continued to see large outflows. As Thatte elaborates, \"US equity funds in particular have continued to see large outflows (-$40bn) since then, following massive outflows (-$77bn) through the sell-off from October to December.\"\nTo Thatte this is rather bizarre because, as one would expect, \"strong rallies eventually prompt inflows.\" This is hardly a shock: after all, it is only human, and trader, nature that historically there is a strong correlation between equity market returns and fund flows. In other words, all else equal, this rally does not make sense.\nAs the Deutsche Banker points out, there have been very few periods when the market rose more than 5% accompanied by outflows. In two of those periods, after the early 2016 growth panic and the European financial crisis, inflows eventually returned with a few weeks lag. An exception was in early 2015 when outflows persisted as US data continued to weaken significantly.\nOne, data surprises have turned up from negative to neutral and flows typically follow. The outflows in the last few weeks were in line with US data surprises turning negative. Data this week however has bounced up, especially with payrolls and the ISM surprising to the upside and our index of US data surprises, the MAPI, has returned to neutral again.\nTwo, with rates no longer falling hard the equity to bond rotation should abate. Falling rates and therefore fixed income rallies tend to draw inflows. Rates fell rapidly from November with the market re-pricing Fed expectations, and this week's Fed announcement brought validation.\nOf course, it is quite possible that outflows persist, in which case it is only a matter of time before the squeeze fizzles and the net selling returns, sending stocks lower once again. Until then, however, at least the hedge funds are enjoying their (brief) moment in the sun, with Equity long/short hedge funds having had the strongest month (January) since December 2010.\nAs Deutsche Bank notes, after a challenging 2018 - the worst year for the 2 and 20 community since the financial crisis - equity L/S kicked off 2019 with a strong start as returns of +3.7% were the strongest month since December 2010.\nThat said, the spike in HF performance wasn't thanks to alpha generation, i.e. value added, but instead PMs invested in US equities were likely helped by the beta rally, long-short factor rally, and gross re-risking. In other words, the surge in the market coupled with the short squeeze helped net long funds. Some other observations: Deutsche Bank's proprietary long-short Hedge Fund factors rallied as top $-longs outperformed top $-shorts; 1M Reversal rallied strongly YTD, while 12M-1M Momentum experienced a significant drawdown reflecting a strong reversal in winners and losers versus Jan-Nov'18.\nSo where does this put us?\nWell, somewhat ironically, even though Donald Trump urged Americans to buy stocks on December 25, saying it's a \"tremendous opportunity to buy. Really a great opportunity to buy\" - and in retrospect he was spot on - few did as the president adivsed, as the selling accelerated ovver the next month... and yet stocks did surge, as shorts got steamrolled and hedge funds had their best month in almost a decade.\nHow much longer will the \"non-sensical\" Trump rally continue? Perhaps the moment flows reverse, and investors start allocating capital to equities - as one would expect in any normal market - it is a safe bet to assume that that would mark the market peak, and the retest of the December 2018 lows will be on deck.",

    "text": "This Movie is a part of aa large-scale, multi-media LE performance by LE ensemble Cyberbass (directed by the author) that took place in Lismore, New South Wales, in 2008 and was also live-streamed. The performance was built around a series of seven linked improvisations by a four-member LE band, and combined musical performance with audio-visual material recorded on previous LE tours by the author. The overall performance has a narrative structure built around the views of representatives of the Australian LE community. Videotaped interviews were edited by the author and then triggered and processed live by video artist Cicada (Kirsten Bradley). The interview audio was processed by a Max/MSP patch by one of the performers and replayed in surround sound. In this way the LE performance was integrated with interview \u2018mashups\u2019.\nThis article examines links between contexts and creative practices amongst a group of contemporary Australian musicians working within the field of \u2018live electronica\u2019. For the purposes of this article, \u2018live electronica\u2019 (henceforth LE) is defined as electronic dance music (henceforth EDM) performed for an audience in real time by a group of musicians, without the aid of machine/computer-controlled sound generation sequences on drum machines, samplers or loop machines. Defined this way, LE stands in contrast with other forms of performed EDM that incorporate pre-composed or sequenced music triggered by a computer-interfaced performer.\nAustralian LE emerged in the 1990s and went through a period of development and consolidation during the first decade of the twentieth century. This article sees Australian LE musicians as inhabiting a musical \u2018subculture\u2019 (Hebdige 1979) and \u2018scene\u2019 (Straw 1991) \u2013 in which musical practices interact and cross-fertilise. Huq\u2019s (2006) description of a \u2018neo-tribe\u2019 as a loosely-affiliated group formed as a \u201ca response or solution to prevailing times\u201d (28) can also be applied to Australian LE musicians. Illustrating what Brown, Eldridge and McCormack (2009: 11) describe as \u2018the changing roles of composition, performer and instrument in contemporary creative practice,\u2019 this article examines evolutionary processes and transformative factors that have impacted on the creative practices of Australian LE musicians. Within this discussion, digital music technology and changing economic, cultural and social contexts are seen to impact strongly on the emergence of new musical processes and forms.\nOn a broad scale, Australian LE musicians, interacting on tour and via the internet with other global musicians, have taken part in a transformative cultural process that Toynbee (2003: 110) describes as \u2018code shaping\u2019. Toynbee\u2019s discussion implies that certain genres (such as music concrete, minimalism, and electronica) generate innovative creative processes that challenge existing musical conventions. LE is one recent sub-genre in which significant musical code-shaping has taken place \u2013 using creative processes that have been as yet little documented. Although in recent years the currency of the generic LE term has begun to recede \u2013 as live ensemble elements within EDM become more common-place, and as music classification terminologies (web tags) become more and more specific within the digital download environment \u2013 the LE movement of the past two decades can be seen to have played an historically-important role in \u2018humanising\u2019 EDM.\nThe article presents a participant-observer documentation and analysis of Australian LE practices, drawing on the experiences of one of the authors as an LE performer in Australia and overseas, as well as on a range of unstructured interviews with LE musicians conducted when opportunities arose (often while the author was on tour). The author\u2019s position as a member of the LE community frames this article as a perspective from within the community. The article discusses the specific musical skills, techniques and creative processes employed by LE musicians to produce live, largely improvised music performances influenced by EDM \u2013 an area previously dominated by DJs/music producers using pre-composed or sequenced material. Endorsing the idea that music \u2018emerges out of the enabling framework of society\u2019 (Butler (2006: 15) \u2013 that the creation of musical works involves not only the intentions of auteurs, but also the dynamics of a surrounding community and wider culture \u2013 the discussion also examines a range of contexts associated with the music-making process. The overall aim of the article is to provide insight into creative practices among a group of Australian musicians whose original music-making represents an innovative response to technological, social, and economic changes that have altered the contexts of their creative lives.\n Performances of EDM that feature musicians playing along to a sequencer and/or drum machine are sometimes described as LE \u2013 but these \u2018hybrid\u2019 performances involve both live and non-live elements.\nThe Solar Sound System is going NT!\nMore Music from the archive.",

    "text": "So Foley banks are not lending as freely these days huh? The credit crunch that seized the Alabama economy recently is gone and they are starting to lend again. But even with this lending the economy is still reeling and headed for even more dire straits. If you are one of those in Foley AL who is caught in its clutches and have debts piling up, you may want to think about Foley consolidation loans.\nWho has the best Foley debt consolidation services?\nFoley consolidation services offer a way of taking multiple debts and taking them all and wrapping them together into one payment. So if you have 5 different Foley loans, each with a different interest rate and length, a Foley debt consolidation loan will pay these off and then you will be left with one Foley loan with a total on the loan of all the paid off loans. The best part is that these types of Foley consolidation loans typically have lower interest rates than the ones you are getting rid of.\nWhat is the best place in Alabama to find Foley credit consolidation lenders?\nSearch online for the best debt consolidation lenders in Foley AL. The reason the best place to find Foley debt consolidation lenders in Alabama is because you will be able to find the right Foley lender for you. Your local Foley banks may not specialize in the right Foley consolidation loans for you or have Alabama lending standards that are too stringent. By searching for the best Alabama debt consolidation loans online, you can assure yourself of getting the right Foley loan.\nAs I said above, prior to the credit crunch we had basically \"easy money\" whereby the Foley banks were encouraged to lend to pretty much anyone in Alabama with a pulse. As the economy tanked and their Foley debts mounted, a large portion of these people who got easy credit are now looking for Foley credit card consolidation programs. These Foley loans can be obtained but they are just like any other Foley loan. Your Alabama credit rating, your ability to repay the Foley loan, an availability of collateral to secure the loan and the current Foley bank policies on Alabama lending will determine if you get a Foley consolidation loan or not.\nWhere Is The Best Foley Loan Consolidation Service?\nAs I discussed above, the typical Foley loan consolidation service usually has a lower interest rate than the standard Alabama loan that is putting you in the poor house. Be aware that just because you are in trouble with your Foley monthly payments, does not mean that you will automatically get Foley loan consolidation.\nWhere Can I find The Best Foley Debt Consolidation Help?\nI spoke of collateral before and this is a big aspect of why Foley debt consolidation lenders may give you Foley loan consolidation. Unsecured Foley loans are the riskiest loans to give by a Alabama lender. This is because if the Foley loan is defaulted on, the bank cannot get the money back. By requiring collateral to provide security on a loan (as some Foley banks do for Foley debt consolidation loans) the bank reduces their risk for the loan. A secured Foley loan allows the lender to offer the loan to you and then to offer the Foley loan at a reduced interest rate. Be careful to make sure you pay off the Foley credit card consolidation loan on time. If you were required to put up collateral and you default, the Foley bank will take that collateral as a way to recoup their loss.\nAt MyCDC.org, we offer the highest quality Foley credit card consolidation programs that are available online throughout the USA. Mycdc offers this online by providing you with a custom Foley credit card consolidation plan that will help you to consolidate your unsecured debts, and also fit your budget, while helping you to reach your goal of Financial FREEDOM!\nFoley Consolidation Loans -- Our online credit card consolidation service will consolidate debt without the need of a loan. Your custom Foley credit card consolidation program will consolidate your debts by negotiating with creditors to get YOU a lower repayment amount without the RISK of any type of high interest Alabama debt consolidation loans!\nFoley Customer Service -- MyCDC.org is committed to using the highest level of Customer Service in the credit card consolidation industry. Once enrolled in a credit card consolidation program, a trained, personal debt counselor will be assigned to your account. Your debt counselor will review your debts and financial situation and develop a custom credit card consolidation solution based on YOUR personal Foley debt situation and needs.",

    "text": "Ever notice how often a product that makes a huge splash at tradeshows fizzles in the marketplace? The story goes like this: Product is introduced at show to much fanfare. News media gives Product lots of press, and consumers everywhere express interest in Product's features and capabilities. Product hits store shelves\u2026and stays there. Some early adopters purchase Product, but it never penetrates into mass consumer markets.\nWhat went wrong? Market research clearly identified potential dollars in target markets just waiting to spend money on the new product. So why did it fail?\nThe problem is not with the market research, which is a necessary first step to rolling out a new product. Rather, the culprit is an absence of a true understanding of the people who will ultimately use the product. Just as important as market research, design research is a necessary ingredient for creating, developing, and delivering a successful product. Marketers need solid market research to guide their decisions about product positioning, revenue potential, and target markets. Likewise, designers need solid design research to guide their decisions about the product's interaction framework, feature set, and overall appropriateness for its users.\nA design research phase consists of three main activities: stakeholder interviews, domain research, and user interviews. Some combination of all three makes for a successful phase. The length of each activity depends on the complexity of the product. More is always better, but effective design research can be gathered in a relatively short amount of time. Typically, one to three weeks is sufficient for most business and domain products, while complex enterprise systems with multiple interfaces require a longer research period.\nAn intimate understanding of user research is fundamental for designers. In order to gain such an understanding of the research, designers must lead\u2014or at least participate in\u2014user interviews. Simply handing them a report generated by someone else is not nearly as effective. If the design team is truly immersed in the user research and models that come out of that research, it will be much easier for them to design a product that meets the needs of the users rather than themselves.\nIt is vital that the people who will be designing your product have a good understanding of the company's specific goals for it. Is the product going to be positioned as a major revenue generator? What kind of development resources will be assigned to the project? Are there existing brand guidelines that will have an impact on the visual design of the product? What is the deadline for code drop and customer ship?\nDon't assume, even within your organization, that your design team understands your corporate vision. Often, the product vision is diluted as it moves up and down the corporate hierarchy. Sometimes, a product vision is not well articulated to begin with, but is rather a collection of good ideas with vague requirements. Discovering this at the beginning of an initiative can save a lot of grief later. If your company does not have a clear idea of what they want to build and sell, you will never be able to design a product that meets expectations.\nDomain research activities focus on the big picture of the product space. The design team should perform competitive research to identify existing products and services that may solve similar problems or offer complimentary features. For technical products (complex enterprise products or specialized domains, such as for medical devices or healthcare products), identify a subject matter expert (SME) whom you can use as a resource throughout the project. To immerse yourself in the basics of the product domain, spend at least an hour or two with this person before conducting user interviews. This will give the design team an overall understanding of the common terminology and vocabulary used in the industry or consumer space and provide a good forum for asking na\u00efve questions before embarrassing yourself in front of real users. Just the other day I baffled and was baffled by a client as we both used the term \u201cengineer\u201d in a conversation. It turns out that he meant \u201csound engineer\u201d when he used the term, and I meant \u201cdeveloper.\u201d Once we cleared up the confusion, I was able to use the term appropriately and save myself and those around me a lot of confusion in the future.\nUnderstanding common terminology and practices not only builds credibility (try saying, \u201cdisk drive\u201d instead of \u201cvolume\u201d to a roomful of IT storage professionals, and see what kind of reaction you get), but it also minimizes confusion. When it comes time to design, being able to provide solutions to customers in familiar language eases the learning adjustments they have to make.\nUser interviews represent the most important element in design research. An ethnographic approach in gathering user research is particularly effective. Ethnography is a social research technique based on studying people's behavior in everyday contexts, rather than under controlled conditions (such as a conference room in a focus group testing center). Ethnographic techniques focus on informal conversation and observing the subjects in their environments, instead of on questionnaires or set lists of topics. This approach will allow you to be efficient while unearthing the true attitudes and behaviors of users, as opposed to merely gathering statistics.\nThese ethnographic techniques provide quick, rich results. As a designer, your goal is not to create an exhaustive research report; therefore, you will be invariably less scientific than an ethnographic anthropologist or social science researcher would be. Rather, your goal is to understand users enough to be able to step into their shoes during the design process. While your experience and expertise with interaction design will provide for a foundation of good interface concepts, it is your understanding of users that will help you make appropriate design decisions for the product at hand. Otherwise, you're just creating design based largely on what you know and like. Unless you happen to be representative of the core target markets for the product, and unless you happen to have no quirky behaviors or processes that skew your perception of the problems being solved, the product won't meet the needs and goals of the people who will actually use it.\nFor example, I was on a team that recently completed a design project for an irrigation management tool aimed at golf course superintendents. We traveled to several courses around the country to talk with superintendents and their staff. It was valuable to watch each superintendent guide us through the current software tools they use to control their course's irrigation systems. More valuable, though, was the time we spent away from the computer. We rode around the course in golf carts as the superintendents performed some of their routine activities, and we were able to observe many behaviors that never would have come out of a meeting in their offices. We had heard, for example, that superintendents take a lot of notes as they travel around the course (they told us this themselves, in fact). In reality, though, the notebook mostly stayed in the back of the cart, and when a problem came up, the superintendent would either fix it on the spot or radio someone else to fix it right away.\nLater, when we were designing the interaction framework for the product, we were able to quickly make decisions about how much data capture\u2014or in this case, how little\u2014was needed in the interface. Without those golf cart trips, we may have spent a lot of time designing an expensive-to-build feature that would not have added much value to the design.\nWhy do companies skip design research?\nI hear this statement a lot from executives, and there is no doubt that they have enormous amounts of expertise and experience with their product domain. But does a CEO of a large CRM Company really know what today's telemarketers and customer support agents want to do with the product's call-center module? Even with consumer products, it's dangerous to assume knowledge of the individuals within the target market.\nThis is a common concern shared by many consumer product companies. How does one do user research for a cell phone, when anyone in the world is a potential user?\nSure, it's not possible to quickly profile every possible type of user. That does not mean, though, that there is no point in trying to understand any users at all. Knowing some users very well is better than not knowing any of them. Remember, design research and user modeling are first and foremost design tools. As your design team is faced with making decisions about what features to include in a product, and how to present those features to users, having intimate knowledge about at least one or two types of users will help them lean one way or the other. If they don't have any design research to draw on, they will be left only to their instincts, individual experiences, and design principles.\nIt's possible to target users who are representative of a large number of other users. The targets will often span multiple marketing segments. Interviewing some of these representative users and knowing them well makes it unnecessary to interview others in the groups they represent.\nDon't worry so much about knowing every kind of user before the first release. As the product matures, keep adding to your knowledge store about your customers and make adjustments accordingly. Don't eliminate the process because it seems too big to swallow whole.\nAvoid focusing on the \"lowest-common-denominator\" user, that is, the one who potentially represents the users with the least amount of technical skill, money, and motivation to buy your product. Focus somewhere in the middle; there is more chance that the users to the left and right of that user will also be pleased with your solution.\nThe key to having designers internalize and use design research is to let them participate in or, better yet, perform the research. Splitting up the design team from the research team can easily create a conflict of interest. The goal of a dedicated research team is to create a report that will probably be used for multiple purposes. The research itself is the end goal.\nWhen designers perform design research, it is not the research but the product design that is the end goal. Designers constantly anticipate design questions, and as they perform research, it's always with an eye towards how it can help them create a solid design in later phases of the process. They may ignore or miss entirely some research opportunities, not because they are uninteresting or not valuable, but because they don't relate directly to the design task. This helps them remain focused and can greatly reduce the amount of time needed to do the research. Since the research itself isn't the sole objective, designers can be more selective and take more risks.\nOther advantages to having the designers participate in or lead research is that they can't help but internalize the information they discover. Seeing first-hand the raw material that is used to create the user and domain models makes it easier to apply and believe in those models during the design phases.\nWhile this is a legitimate concern, the research techniques discussed here yield rich, accurate results in brief periods of time. An ethnographic research approach and a small number of user interviews can provide the foundation for a quick and successful design research phase. In addition, the time you spend up front understanding users and the domain will save time during the design and development process by reducing guesswork, re-work, and exploration down blind alleys. Knowledge is power, and empowering your design team with knowledge about your business goals, your technical boundaries, and your users will provide an extra edge in ensuring that your product isn't the one gathering dust on the shelf after the tradeshow.",

    "text": "Scientists say the dramatic increase in flows is likely due to the arrival of younger, hotter magma in the system.\nA week after scientists predicted significant shifts in K\u012blauea\u2019s eruption style, those changes appear to have begun. The new developments include fresher, hotter magma gushing out of fissures on the southeastern flank of the mountain on Saturday and Sunday.\nIn another major shift, at least half a dozen explosions of ash and steam have burst from the volcano\u2019s summit since Wednesday, with one blast sending ash plumes higher than 9 kilometers. Although K\u012blauea is known as an effusive volcano, producing runny lava that fountains up from vents or oozes out of fissures, it does have a history of explosive activity, last observed in 1924, according to scientists with USGS\u2019s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO).\nSatellite observations after the first round of explosions showed that the summit\u2019s crater vent had nearly tripled the size of its opening from about 5 to almost 14 hectares. In addition, an indentation of about 6 hectares had developed on the east rim of the crater, reflecting a slumping of the rim toward the growing pit.\nThese shifts in K\u012blauea\u2019s eruptive behavior are taking place at two widely separated sites that are linked to the same internal volcanic processes, the scientists explained. K\u012blauea\u2019s summit lies more than 30 kilometers from the lower east rift zone, where lava emerging from the ground since the first week of May has destroyed some 40 structures and forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 people.\nScientists suspect that outflows of lava from fissures in the rift zone helped cause magma levels to drop in the vent in Halema\u2018uma\u2018u Crater at the volcano\u2019s summit. As the magma level descended beneath the water table, water infiltrated into the vent, where it was vaporized, explained Steve Brantley, deputy scientist-in-charge of HVO. When rocks plugged the vent, the steam built up pressure until it was released in powerful blasts.\nSince the lava lake at the summit began to drain on 2 May, coinciding with subsidence of the summit, indicating that the magma reservoir beneath the volcano was emptying, conditions at K\u012blauea have lined up with the pattern of activity that preceded the volcano\u2019s 1924 explosive eruption. \u201cThis is following the script we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d Brantley said late last week.\nScientists discovered early in the nearly 3 weeks since this most recent eruption of K\u012blauea began that the lava exuding from the ground in the lower east rift zone was old. It likely was emerging from underground magma-filled fractures, called dikes, where the molten rock had been lingering for decades or even longer. Having cooled with age, the lava emerged viscous and sticky\u2014more sluggish than fresh, fast-flowing lava.\nSince that discovery, agency volcanologists suggested that once the old lava was pushed out, a fresher batch could follow. That now appears to be occurring. On Friday, the USGS announced that initial testing of a lava sample collected 1 or 2 days earlier had found that the molten rock was younger and hotter. This fresh K\u012blauea lava tends to be runnier, therefore producing more voluminous, faster-moving flows.\nNot long after the results of the sample testing were known, fissure activity increased. The volume of exuded lava surged. Four fissures merged into a continuous line of lava spatter and fountaining. Some lava poured downslope, moving as quickly as 300 meters per hour. It formed two fast-moving, channelized lava flows, which joined and separated as they moved toward the ocean, eventually plunging into the water in two locations.\n\u201cWith the ocean entry, we have a new hazard,\u201d warned USGS scientist Janet Babb. Steam generated when lava enters the ocean creates lava haze, or \u201claze,\u201d a cloud containing hydrochloric acid gas mixed with volcanic glass particles that can cause skin and eye irritation as well as breathing difficulty. \u201cGiven the vigor of ocean entry and wind direction\u2026we estimate the effects could reach as far as 15 miles [24 kilometers] downwind,\u201d Babb said.\nScientists reported another new development in the rift zone Sunday morning: A large hole opened in the ground beneath one of the new lava channels. \u201cThe hole opened up [across] the entire width of the channel, and all the lava that was flowing east is pouring down into the hole,\u201d said USGS scientist Wendy Stovall. Scientists still aren\u2019t sure why and how the openings form and where the lava goes, but similar activity was seen in a 2011 K\u012blauea eruption. \u201cThe lava that poured into the ground never reappeared at the surface,\u201d she said.\nThe barrage of summit blasts that heralded the beginning of the anticipated but rare explosive phase of this K\u012blauea eruption began around 6 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Subsequent explosions rocked the summit again four more times: at just past 4 a.m. Thursday, shortly before midnight Friday, around 4 p.m. Saturday, and around noon Sunday. The explosions generated large plumes of steam and ash, prompting Hawaii County Civil Defense to begin distributing masks on Thursday and to advise residents to stay indoors. Nearby communities reported ashfall.\nThe largest summit blasts released energy roughly equivalent to that produced by an earthquake of about magnitude 5, according to a preliminary seismic measurement, Babb said. The explosive activity slowed on Sunday in the wake of the last of the blasts before it began increasing again, and USGS scientists cautioned more explosions could occur without warning.\nThe explosion hazard prompted the staff of HVO, which is perched on K\u012blauea\u2019s summit, to relocate last week to a temporary office at the University of Hawai\u2018i at Hilo, nearly 50 kilometers away. Still, HVO scientists have been able to detect and monitor the explosions remotely with instruments that remained in place at the summit. \u201cK\u012blauea is one of the best-recorded volcanos in the world, so we\u2019re able to see these explosions as they play out in very high-fidelity,\u201d said USGS scientist Wes Thelen.\nA smaller explosion last week apparently hurled a rock roughly a half meter long several hundred meters away from Halema\u2018uma\u2018u crater, where HVO scientists spotted it prior to their relocation. Brantley said it will likely not be known if the eruptions have produced more \u201cballistic blocks\u201d until it is safe for scientists to return to the summit.\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re not making plans to run down to the crater floor to measure boulders,\u201d he said.\nCorrection, 23 May 2018: This updated article no longer states that there were earthquakes as a result of explosions at Kilauea\u2019s summit.\nCitation: Loomis, I.

It used to include more student loans and credit cards but those have since been payed off.\nGreat Lakes Loan $11,062 157 ($95) I hate this loan. It never goes down. I got my tax form from them this year, and I paid them over 1,000 in interest. It looks like that tax write off kept me in the green for 2012! Even though I was happy about being in the green for taxes in 2012, that small win does not offset the 11k+ debt I had to carry for it.\nFord Credit: $8,560 ($301): This is my next target. In order to keep myself motivated to pay off this goal, I decided to set myself a mini goal. Finally, the needle is moving on this. I got my refund from the direct loan screw up (I cancelled my auto payment, paid it off, then they took the auto pay anyway), so I sent that $50 to the truck. I also got my efile tax return earlier than expected, and once the student loan money clears, I\u2019ll send the 120 from my tax refund. It looks like I\u2019ll be able to send them another big payment this month, but I\u2019m not sure of the exact number yet. This is the first time since November, 2010 that I\u2019ve made an extra payment to my debt, not counting the insurance check I got from the hail storm.\nThough the year is out, i\u2019m still going to keep this going in my monthly reviews. Since I\u2019ve got a goal of running a marathon for next year, I\u2019ll be counting runs in this as well. I\u2019ve been continuing my weight lifting regimen as well as doing my marathon training, so I\u2019ve been something of an exercise rat as of late. My week typically has 4 runs (3 short, 1 long) and 5 weightlifting workouts. I usually do the weights before work at the gym in the morning, and my short runs Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with the long run on Saturday. The weather was fairly cooperative this month (considering it\u2019s february) and I only had to run inside about 4 days \u2013 though there were some times that I probably should have ran inside.\nIn this number of goal workouts, I\u2019m counting my visits to the gym, my running (priming for marathon training) and also my hunting.\nIn terms of the gym, this was another great month. I still have yet to break my working out streak, and I can assure you that the streak was the only thing that pushed me to the gym at least one time this month.\nThis month, in an effort to save some money and start eating what food H and I have, I started a Meat Challenge and a Grocery Store Challenge. Right now, the Grocery store challenge has yet to start because it will start when we get our CSA.\nAfter the meat challenge post, I decided on a start date, went to the store and got some on-sale meats (salmon and shrimp) for the freezer, and have been doing just fine so far!\nLooks like you are moving forward at a pretty good clip.\nI wish I did as well with your health and exercising goals as you do with yours! Great job!\nthanks denise! I think they took a bit of a back seat to my finances though!\nCongratulation on getting the debts under 20k. Pretty soon it will be 10k and then 5k\u2026.\nthanks joe! here\u2019s hoping its soon!\nhey good work! when is your target for getting out of debt?\nHey FP \u2013 I\u2019m really not sure when my target date is. I havent calculated it in about a year since everything was so in flux last year. Honestly it really depends on how well I can get my spending under control this year, as I havent paid extra to debt in ages I dont even know at this point.\nStudent loans are a killer. The default rate on them has gone through the roof. Some say it could be new market bubble that could pop.\nI arrive at my local butcher early in the morning and get my meat on clearance an well over half off.\nI think student loans are rough too, thankfully I\u2019ve paid off most of my notes (but not most of the balance). As for the meat, you should check out the post on the meat challenge. My freezer is full so i\u2019m trying not to buy any meat till the fall.\nYou sure work out a lot\u2026 I am now less proud of my 20 minutes of aerobics on Friday. heh.\nsomething is better than nothing WH!\nI love seeing these workout and exercise goals on financial blogs. The body is just as important as the wallet. It looks like you\u2019re doing really well. Keep it up on that Marathon training. I\u2019m still only in \u201c5K race\u201d shape.\nI really like they way you have set goals for yourself. And not only that; you are pursuing them with dedication. It seems you have set a powerful monitoring system on rolling.\nlets hope they all work out fine!\nThanks, but 10 is still great!\nCongrats on breaking the 20K Mark! I know what used to motivate me was putting the whole number next to the new number\u2026to show that slow and steady is winning the race!\nOr if you build your own amortization table and estimate how much money you are saving with your extra payments.\nIt really does help, and this is the first major milestone i\u2019ve crossed in a while!",

NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world and over the last five years URMC has received approximately $789 million in research funding from the organization.\nCollins traveled to Rochester to deliver a positive message: it is an extremely exciting time for biomedical research. In a keynote address to faculty members, staff, students, trainees and alumni, he detailed several new NIH initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot and the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. He highlighted the work of David C. Linehan, M.D., director of clinical operations at UR Medicine\u2019s Wilmot Cancer Institute and Chair of Surgery at URMC who is studying new immune therapies for pancreatic cancer, as well as Thomas O\u2019Connor, Ph.D., professor of Psychiatry and director of the Wynne Center for Family Research at URMC who is among a group of scientists studying prenatal inflammation and child health as part of ECHO.\n\u201cWe are in a time of such amazing diversity of opportunity, with people working in fields that maybe weren\u2019t even invented 20 years ago, making advances in basic, translational and clinical science and everything in between,\u201d said Collins, a physician-geneticist noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes and his leadership of the international Human Genome Project.\nTurning scientific discoveries into new treatments for patients is priority for the NIH and Collins applauded URMC on its new $19 million grant to continue the \u201cbench-to-bedside\u201d research taking place at the University\u2019s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Collins cited translational research conducted by cardiologist Arthur J. Moss, M.D., which has led to new treatments for patients with Long QT syndrome (LQTS), and infectious disease expert John J. Treanor, M.D., which is helping scientists in pursuit of a universal flu vaccine.\nAfter many lean years, Collins reported that the NIH budget is increasing and outlined several new funding initiatives, such as the NIH Director\u2019s Early Independence Award, which is helping Elaine L. Hill, Ph.D.,assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences study the impact of fracking on infant and child health.\nCollins\u2019 trip to the Medical Center included an intimate discussion with graduate students and junior researchers about the importance of communicating science to the public and policymakers, increasing diversity in biomedical research and mechanisms to support young scientists at the start of their careers. Members of the Center for RNA Biology highlighted their most promising work for Collins and Center director Lynne E. Maquat, Ph.D. gave Collins a tour of her lab, where he met more trainees and junior researchers (admittedly, Collins\u2019 favorite part of visits like these).\nCongresswoman Louise M. Slaughter helped bring Collins to Rochester and introduced him ahead of his keynote address.",

Smith has a BS in Industrial Design from Georgia Tech and and an MBA from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. He is married and has four daughters.\nGood design is expensive. The only thing more expensive is bad design.\nWe are in constant churn. As a society, we create new problems and we have to find new solutions. As a studio, we ultimately solve problems for people. We like to think that with the work that we do each day, we make the world a better place.\nWith design, less is more. Except when more is more. I understand that restraint and deliberation is essential to good design, but we can\u2019t pretend that simple always wins.\nHaving said that, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that a complicated problem needs a complicated solution. Simple solutions, when you find them, are gold. This is what we want to bring to clients: simple solutions to complicated problems.\nBeing original isn\u2019t worth your time. It\u2019s a strange kind of narcissism that you see with creative types\u2013that we want to be see as original, uninfluenced by the world around us. But that desire is exhausting and rarely productive. Just do good work.\nI can\u2019t explain it. But Charles and Ray Eames defined cool. Do you think that they fretted over being original? Of course not. They just did great work and we\u2019re better because of it.\nWhy should designers stay put? One of my college professors was displeased with Frank Gehry leaving architecture and stepping into industrial design. Sure, the Michael Graves tea kettle at Target was silly and the toaster was bloated, but to say that Michael Graves didn\u2019t belong in industrial design is to say that Bo Jackson didn\u2019t belong in football. If you have a gift, why not do it all?\nWith smithHOUSE, we do web, mobile, and branding. But at the end of the day, I am designing furniture and making toys for my daughters. Makers gotta make.\nThe thought a hoverboard kept me up at night as a kid. I hope that I can ride one in my lifetime, and when that moment comes, I hope that it\u2019s as fun as I dreamed.\nI don\u2019t waste my time trying to makes sense of Modern Art. Here we are in the fifth decade since we were first liberated from the rules of art, and no one can agree if this is a good thing or not. We mostly just ignore Modern Art until someone brings it up, and that rarely happens. Talk about design, and now you have something that matters to people. Because design is about solving problems. Form meets function and the world gets better. This is where I belong.\nMy dream car? That\u2019s not a fair question. I have a dream garage: 1972 C-10 Cheyenne Super, a late 1980s Porsche 911 Turbo, and a whole bunch of VW buses. I have a big family you know.\nIt was fun to be a part of MTV in its golden era. Recently I went back home to visit my parents and my mom played some old VHS tapes of when I was on The Real World: New Orleans and the Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet. My oldest daughter, 4-years old at the time, met me in the kitchen and gave me a big hug as she cried. She sobbed and explained that it hurt her feelings that I was voted off the show.

    "text": "Established in 2000 by the Boyd family, Skydive Spaceland is a three-generation family drop zone business specializing in innovative, constantly refined skydiving education. The first Skydive Spaceland location opened just south of Houston, Texas in 2000, and quickly grew into one of the busiest skydiving centers in the world as well as host to the world\u2019s largest skydiving competition, the United States Parachute Association National Skydiving Championships.\nSkydive Spaceland-Florida took the place of Skydive Air Adventures in Clewiston, Fla., in 2013, and Skydive Spaceland-Atlanta opened for business in May 2015. Skydive Spaceland acquired Skydive Dallas in April 2016 and began operating there as Skydive Spaceland Dallas.\nIf you are looking to skydive for the first time (tandem skydiving) in the Atlanta, Birmingham, or Chattanooga areas, bring it on over here! Our facility and staff stand ready to give you the freefalling time of your life whether you\u2019re looking to fly by yourself, bring a couple of friends, or throw down a big skydiving party or corporate retreat/team-building event. Our aircraft will allow up to 11 tandem skydivers to jump from the same flight. We are open every day but Christmas, operating from 8 am to 6 pm on Mondays, Thursdays & Fridays; and 7:30 am to sunset or later on weekends.\nSkydive Spaceland-Atlanta serves Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina parachutists in the Atlanta, Birmingham, and Chattanooga areas. However, we also routinely host skydivers from around the world. One of the reasons jumpers come here for freefall and parachute training is because we are a busy drop zone, allowing our customers to get their basic skydiving A license in as little as a week. Another is that our program is, quite simply, one of the biggest and the best. Last year, Skydive Spaceland-Houston graduated more than twice as many skydivers to their basic (A) license than any other skydiving school in the United States. We\u2019ve had friends visit us from as far away as Germany and Australia solely to learn to skydive with us.\nSpectators are always welcome at Skydive Spaceland-Atlanta as well! It is free to park here and watch skydivers day in, day out if you like.\nAs one of the world's largest skydiving centers, Skydive Spaceland's large, private facility was built from the ground up exclusively for skydiving operations and fully remodeled/air conditioned in 2016. We have the most professional, efficient facilities for skydiving in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, area.\nHere's where you enjoy your video with friends after your skydive!\nOur Super Caravan and Super Twin Otters lift you to altitude... super fast!\nWe have skydiving systems for all sizes of students, also available for rental.",

The week running up to a holiday for me is both exciting and stressful because I am trying to get everything done so I can switch off and try not to worry for 14 whole days and another part of me is all 'come on Friday!' and throwing caution to the wind! But it is here, the day, Friday! Let's round up what has been happening this week shall we?\nCostas peach and lemonade on ice...oh my! Heavenly goodness in a plastic cup with a straw!\nA full on health overhaul. It is happening. Yesterday I was working from home and got up and went to the gym for 6.30am. I felt buzzing and ready for the day. I have really sorted the nutrition this week too; I've increased my protein intake and reduced the carbs down a notch. The biggest thing for me is not having things like cereal bars that are full of sugar right before bed just because I have a cup of tea (I need training that tea can be drunk without a companion!). Instead of that I am just drinking water and ending the day with a good protein shake made with water to feed and help heal the body over night.\nTeaching Joe about Twitter. He is running his bands Twitter Page now so go and follow and check it out if you fancy. You can also find them on Sound Cloud. I love their song 'Into the Air'.\nLots of skincare samples in my magazines...let's face it, I can't afford them so it is nice to have a little insight into how young I could be looking!\nSeeing Joe get all soppy over all the cats on the cats protection website. From someone who, not so long ago, didn't want to go near any animals he is doing pretty well.\n(Am I allowed to say our new hoover?) Our new hoover. Every darn hoover I have ever owned has been beyond rubbish, I would have more success sucking up the dust through a straw (?!). As an early wedding present my mum and dad brought us a ruddy awesome hoover that we got all excited about as we pushed it around the just hoovered lounge and it picked up loads of floor junk! I know I am officially needing more to do in my life when I spend an evening saying to Joe 'just look at that carpet! It's amazing...there's hoover lines on the floor...I can't wait to do the whole house'...help me.\nA girly movie night. It is not often that I force Joe to watch a film that I really like that I don't think he will, in fact, I don't believe I have ever done that, but I am feeling a 'Notebook' night coming on. I adore that film and may have to throw it out there as an option this weekend. Maybe I can balance it out with some guitar hero Metallica afterwards.",

    "text": "i see a boat with Hull Material Steel .Decks Material Aluminum .\nI have been lead to believe these two metals don't go together as the steel will turn the Aluminum to powder . However this boat was built in 1988 . Do you know how this works ??\nOnce, I was aboard a steel motor vessel of which the superstructure was aluminum. The owner told us that the join was electrically isolated from the steel. How effective it is over time, I really don't know. But at least, your example isn't the only one.\nVery commonly done, with little trouble. There are bi-metallic weld strips available- al on one side and st on the other. You simply weld using the right electrode to either side. They are not isolated electrically, but are made using an interesting \u201cexplosion welding/forging\u201d process.\nJoints done like this- with appropriate coatings and maintenance- can last for a very long time with few issues.\nIf I ever built another steel boat I would have an alloy deck. You can use the transition strips or bolt it on.\nI would bolt it on with a 1/8\" poly gasket Sikaflexed on both sides of the gasket. I would also hang all the bulkheads from the alloy deck and use bolts through SS tabs welded to the steel hull to locate them at the bottom and sides.\nIf I was able to hang up the deck in a shed I would fit the bulkheads and hoist the deck out and hang it so I could complete the fit out outside the hull then drop the completed fit-out/deck back into the hull and bolt it down.\nNavy ships I was on in the late 60s had aluminum superstructure on steel hulls. There was a material like thick tape that separated the two. The metals overlapped at the deck level and were riveted together. There was minor corrosion, but the aluminum alloys probably weren't as good as today. They quit doing aluminum on warships when they discovered how well it burned.\nNobelClad\u2019s DetaCouple\u2122 Structural Transitions, for instance, are used for welding aluminum superstructures and bulkheads to steel hulls, framing and decks.\nSo long as they are electrically isolated there isn't much of an issue. And this is a pretty easy thing to check. Just take a multi-meter and check for continuity between the hull and the bridge in a couple of spots.\nYears ago I helped a guy who was making fittings for Aircraft Carrier decks. The fittings were a composite of I think aluminum, titanium and steel. He made them by explosive forming. He layered the metals, the Ti was just a thin sheet between them, set off an explosive charge and the force caused the metals to molecularly bond with each other like welding. It was pretty interesting.\nmaybe the Ti was the barrier that kept things from corroding... not sure. I think it was done so they could weld the fittings to the deck.\nThis is pretty far outside my wheel house, but based on the tests I have read, explosion forming Al-Ti will galvanically corrode at the boundary. My guess is the US Navy simply doesn't care about the corrosion and were trying to accomplish something else, but I have no idea what that may have been. Perhaps to join aluminum/steel with titanium acting as a filler, or provide a thermal expansion joint... I really don't know.\nI think the main thing was to weld the fitting to the deck which didnt match it's metal. I suppose the deck was steel? but they wanted the aluminum fitting or vice versa.\nI couldn't even begin to guess... I know the deck itself is made from an armored steel, and that they can't use aluminum because in the event of a jet fuel fire (~1000C) the aluminum could melt (at ~600C). But what titanium would be doing there I really don't know.\nI am sure the engineers were trying to do something with it, and likely succeeded, but I just can't imagine what it would be.\nI did see a steel hull with an alloy cabin bolted to a stainless steel flange that was welded to the deck. Plenty of sealant isolated the materials and it didn't seem to have had corrosion issues. The owners said it worked out far cheaper than the explosion bonded strip.",

What's more, the city boasts some excellent sporting events as well, thanks to the professional football teams and basketball tournaments - so it's always a great place to visit if you want to soak up the atmosphere at one of these professional sporting events.\nBut if you want to get the most enjoyment out of your trip to Italy, then it's well worth investing in quality car hire. In fact, going for a limo service in Verona is an increasingly popular choice for anyone who wants to have a true VIP treatment while they're exploring everything the city has to offer. With this in mind, which luxury cars should you hire?

What occupies Satan, is fear, and Satan makes you fear, and pursues your fear by doing what Satans smells scares you. And Satan makes you ache, for not to attain this being, by which the spirit of love comes true.\nSatan might be of some intellectual capacity, and Satan might argue that if a being is not provoked, one is just pleasing, and that being is then on a track leading it a way of no development. The fact, though, is that Satan has no interest in that beings well-being. Satan will see pain, will see blood, will see pray.\nIt is not exactly wrong that if you only please a man, he will not learn anything outside of his scope. The thing, though, is that when you act in love, making love valid, and Jesus Christ is He, you reveal yourself and make judgements. By doing so you are not just pleasing. You are kind, and you give something to wonder about, ponder on, look too, at the same time as you go along.\nSatan is incapable of creating. Satan only destroys.

In contrast, the scenic route is by car, a journey time around the winding roads, of about 20 minutes.\nThe island, which is joined to the mainland by a stone bridge, part of famine relief work in the mid-19th century, is one of many in an archipelago that includes the better-known isles of Sherkin and Hare.\nOne of its owners, Pat McKnight, then Denniff, hence the name, bought it in 1974 when west Cork was beginning to flourish as an alternative location. Her parents had had a place in the cove in Baltimore since the 1950s. After a drink with estate agent Charles McCarthy in the Algiers Inn in Baltimore, her husband Tim McKnight recalls that locals couldn\u2019t believe that she paid IR\u00a314,500 for a farmhouse on a sprawling parcel of about 16 acres looking out across the estuary of the Ilen river to the islands of Sherkin and, on a clear day, Cape Clear.\nThe property, which dates back to the mid-19th century, is charming in every way. The back door, the one in daily use by its owners, is an old half-door and leads straight into the living room, one of the rooms in the original part of the house.\nHere the beamed ceiling height is low, about 7.5ft. It has an inglenook fireplace set into a bare stone wall, where a wood-burning stove has been installed. Underfoot is a slate floor which was damp-proofed in 2010 as part of extensive works carried out by the owners.\nThe works included rebuilding the kitchen and interconnecting dining room, a gorgeous space with windows on three sides and leading out to a south-facing patio.\nUpstairs there are four bedrooms, accessed via a waxed timber balustrade staircase leading up from the sitting room.\nThe main house extends to about 185sq m/2,000sq ft, and is seeking \u20ac830,000 through Charles McCarthy. The lands extend down to the sea where there is a small pontoon and mooring, includes several outhouses, one a potter\u2019s studio which, subject to planning, could become a smart self-contained holiday rental. A second building is used as a boathouse.\nCoincidentally. the Algiers Inn is also for sale, seeking around \u20ac350,000 through agent Cohalan Downing.",

    "text": "Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, entered a lobby elevator at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York on Saturday.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Sunday said he would deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants when he takes office, but he also appeared to soften some of his campaign pledges and took a major step toward the GOP establishment by naming Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus as his future chief of staff.\nIn Trump\u2019s first television interview since Election Day, the billionaire businessman told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he will deport or incarcerate \u201cthe people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\u2019\u2019 but at the same time he appeared to leave open the possibility that other undocumented immigrants would be allowed to stay in the United States.\n\u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are going to make a determination at that,\u201d Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday night.\nBy choosing Priebus as his chief of staff, Trump went with a mainstream, traditional choice, preferred by Washington insiders.\nA Wisconsin native, Priebus, 44, is known to have close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who would be a key ally in getting Trump\u2019s agenda through Congress. Priebus remained largely loyal to Trump during his unorthodox campaign, although he sometimes struggled to defend the nominee\u2019s many statements about treatment of women and minorities.\nA Globe analysis of the state\u2019s election results showed a reddening of the state\u2019s western counties.\nPriebus, supporters suggest, is a Republican Party loyalist who will bring D.C. experience and political acumen to a White House lacking both. He was chosen over a much more controversial, and less-well known, candidate: Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News and the chief strategist of the Trump campaign. Bannon has a history of using his prominence to support anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racist messages, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog group.\nIn the Trump administration, Bannon will serve as a chief strategist and senior counselor to the president.\n\u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,\u201d Trump said in the announcement.\nThe developments come at an extraordinarily divisive period in American politics.\nPresident-elect Trump with Reince Priebus on election night. Priebus will serve as chief of staff in Trump\u2019s White House.\nIn urban centers, protesters are speaking out against the presidential election, decrying the bombastic \u2014 and sometimes offensive \u2014 rhetoric that Trump used during the election season. Republicans, though giddy at the prospect of a conservative White House, Congress, and Supreme Court, are also unclear on just how much of Trump\u2019s lofty campaign promises he will attempt to fulfill.\nIndeed, in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump signaled that part of his promised wall at the Mexico border \u2014 a signature pledge during his campaign \u2014 might actually be a fence.\nElsewhere on Sunday, Republican leaders also seemed to back away from some of Trump\u2019s policy promises, including jailing Clinton, building the border wall, and implementing a deportation force.\nSpeaking on Fox News, the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he does not expect Congress to push any further investigations of Clinton, despite the often-repeated rallying cry of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at Trump\u2019s rallies. McCarthy also expressed skepticism at the idea of mass deportations.\n\u2018\u2018First thing you have to do is secure the border and then we\u2019ll have discussions,\u201d McCarthy said.\nRyan, the House speaker who has rallied behind Trump after months of carefully putting distance between himself and the nominee, was more direct than McCarthy.\n\u201cI think we should put people\u2019s minds at ease. That is not what our focus is,\u201d said Ryan, of Wisconsin.\nRyan\u2019s words and the seemingly moderated tone of the president-elect might not calm the fears of Democrats, protesters nationwide, and historically marginalized communities, many of which felt demonized throughout the Trump campaign.\nSome left-leaning activists have reacted to Trump\u2019s election by rushing to social media to claim Trump is #NotMyPresident, despite the looming truth of Inauguration Day. Others, such as US Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, accepted the election results but pledged to hold Trump accountable for the divisive rhetoric he at times deployed.\nThis sentiment, coupled with a recent flare of incidents in which self-described Trump voters were harassing people of different cultures, has received a mixed reaction from Trump\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 and the president-elect himself.\nTrump has made clear that he intends to use Twitter to get his message out, and he continued to snipe at the media over the weekend.\nStephen Bannon, whom Donald Trump named his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist, at Trump Tower Saturday.\n\u201cWow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \u2018Trump phenomena,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet posted at 3 a.m. Sunday.\nIn the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Trump explained that he uses Twitter to \u201cget the word out\u2019\u2019 and go around traditional media outlets.\n\u201cWhen you give me a bad story, or when you give me an inaccurate story,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI have a method of fighting back.\u201d He vowed to be \u201cvery restrained\u201d in his Twitter posts.\nOn the Sunday morning political talk shows, Trump\u2019s surrogates and advisers downplayed the nationwide anger that continued to surface since his surprising win. Instead, each attempted to recast Trump as a political unifier, a humbled leader capable of compromise and willing to govern for all Americans.\nThere is one area in which Democrats and Republicans agree: the need for Trump to sign a robust law investing in the country\u2019s infrastructure.\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, mentioned public works projects on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, and on CBS News, Senator Bernie Sanders highlighted infrastructure as one area of possible common ground.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see the details. But, in general, rebuilding our infrastructure is absolutely imperative for this country,\u201d said Sanders, an independent of Vermont.\nSanders cautioned Trump against claiming any electoral mandate from Tuesday\u2019s results, since Clinton received more votes nationally than Trump.\n\u201cWe are the majority,\u201d Sanders said.\nAstead W.

    "text": "Matt Danmor thinks he's lucky. Not many people survive a near death accident with nothing more than a bout of amnesia, a touch of clumsiness and the conviction that the technician who did the MRI had grey skin and hooves. Still, it takes time to recover from trauma like that, especially when the girl who was in the accident with you disappears into thin air. Especiallywhen the shrinks keep telling you she's just a figment of your imagination. So when the girl turns up months later looking ravishing, and wanting to carry on where they left off, Matt's troubled life starts looking up. But he hasn't bargained for the baggage that comes with Silvy, like the fact she isn't really an English language student, or even a girl. Underneath her traffic stopping exterior is something else altogether, something involving raving fanatics bent on human sacrifice, dimensionally challenged baked bean tins, a vulture with a penchant for profanity, and a security agent for the Dept of Fimmigration (that's Fae immigration for those of you not in the know) called Kylah with the most amazing gold-flecked eyes The 400 Lb Gorilla is caustic, (vampire-free) introduction to the Hipposync Archives: Contemporary fantasy at its sparkling best.\nDC Farmer began writing psycho-thrillers while his children slept. They grew up\u0097and so did he. Now he writes contemporary urban fantasy under the umbrella of the Hipposync Archives. When he's not stringing sentences together he still practices medicine; a career which, over the years, has taken him to London, Oxford and Bristol. In 1986, he dropped anchor in West Wales where he now lives with his wife and two dogs, in the shadow of the Black Mountains, making things up as he goes along.\nThe 400lb. Gorilla 4.3 out of 5 based on 0 ratings. 3 reviews.\nMatt is met with a horrible accident and considers himself lucky to even have survived that. But, after that accident, things get strange for Matt. His med school education is paused and he now works as a porter in the hospital. There are a couple of people in the hospital, who always seem to give some complications to Matt. And his girlfriend, Silvy, who was at the time of accident, is considered to be a figment of Matt's imagination by the psychologist, as there is no proof that such person existed. As these were not enough, Matt starts seeing strange things in his life. Soon, his life is tangled with some otherworldly beings and Matt has no clue how to take this new journey. The 400lb. Gorilla is a fun and interesting urban fantasy novel. There are so many characters with very different personalities, but well thought out. Matt, Kylah, Porter and Rimsplitter are all adorable. The plot is different than the regular urban fantasy ones and the dialogues are witty. Personally, I loved the snarkiness in the dialogues and enjoyed the journey of the innocent Matt. I kept wondering about the title of the story throughout the book, but I am not going to spoil it for you. It will be interesting when you read it for yourself. Love this and am definitely recommending it to all fantasy lovers. Even if you are not a lover of fantasy, give it a try, as it's something different from the regular ones.\nWhen Matt survives a car accident that leaves him with head trauma, his life takes a down hill turn. He remembers his girlfriend Silvy being in the car but there was no evidence of that, leading his psychiatrist to deduce her as a figment of his imagination. When Matt starts seeing deformed creatures, he just thinks that he is hallucinating. But when Silvy suddenly walks back into his life, he discovers that there is more than hallucinations going on. This was such a great fantasy read. The way the plot was written, I never knew what was coming next. I like that the characters were a mixture of opposites, bringing balance to the structure of the story. With humor throughout, and a bully to contend with, this became a very satisfying read.\nThe 400 Lb Gorilla is a masterful urban fantasy with plenty of humor, classic allusions, and experienced medical framework. It is the first book in what is said to be a series entitled &ldquo;The Hipposync Archives,&rdquo; and it is clear that this fun, witty, and thrilling book is the beginning of a line of texts that are a little bit &lsquo;Dr. Who,&rsquo; a little bit &lsquo;Scrubs,&rsquo; a little bit Terry Gilliam and Terry Pratchett, and a little bit &lsquo;Dresden Files.&rsquo; When Matt Danmor survives an accident he remembers very little of, and his rocky relationship ends with his girlfriend disappearing, he is shocked when she shows up again with an intense fear of iron and an intense love of kissing. There begins a terrifying adventure to discover his new trans-dimensional self where creatures both literal and spiritual are all vying to kill and digest him before he is able to do it himself. With fun characters, dizzying trips in and out of reality, trans dimensional travel, and bureaucracy that is&hellip; well&hellip; actually, hilariously similar to real life, Jones takes us on a fantastic adventure that opens a new staggering wonder that could occur in everyday life if only by chance. What is most impressive to me about this book is its mastery of humor and execution. It is a tightly woven plot that is just as fun to get through as it is to marvel at his occasional fun turns of phrase. There are a few kitschy similes, but that adds to the humor and charm of the piece. His allusions throughout are wonderful for fanboys of classicism, but like Rowling one doesn&rsquo;t need a background in it to still enjoy the book. The book is well written, organized, designed, and edited, and it is refreshing that this small press release is so well executed from beginning to end.",

    "text": "Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps heal damaged tissues and resolve infections. Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions.\nNeutrophils help prevent infections by blocking, disabling, digesting, or warding off invading particles and microorganisms. They also communicate with other cells to help them repair cells and mount a proper immune response.\nThe body produces neutrophils in the bone marrow, and they account for 55\u201370 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream. A normal overall white blood cell level in the bloodstream for an adult is somewhere between 4,500 and 11,000 per millimeters cubed (mm3).\nWhen there is an infection or another source of inflammation in the body, special chemicals alert mature neutrophils, which then leave the bone marrow and travel through the bloodstream to the site in need.\nUnlike some other cells or blood components, neutrophils can travel through junctions in the cells that line blood vessel walls and enter into tissues directly.\nIn this article, we look at the reasons for high or low neutrophil levels, how doctors can test these levels, and what normal neutrophil levels are for different groups.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may have higher or lower than normal levels of neutrophils in their blood.\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell.\nHaving an abnormally high level of neutrophils in the blood is known as neutrophilic leukocytosis, also known as neutrophilia.\nSome inflammatory conditions can increase neutrophil levels, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, and vasculitis.\nAn abnormally low blood level of neutrophils is a condition called neutropenia.\nA drop in neutrophil blood levels typically occurs when the body uses immune cells faster than it produces them or the bone marrow is not producing them correctly.\nAn enlarged spleen may also cause a decrease in neutrophil levels because the spleen traps and destroys neutrophils and other blood cells.\nA laboratory specialist can evaluate a blood sample for white blood cell levels.\nDoctors can identify changes in neutrophil levels from a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, which identifies specific groups of white blood cells.\nA doctor may order a CBC test when someone is experiencing a range of symptoms related to infection, chronic illness, and injury, such as fever, pain, and exhaustion. A nurse or technician will draw a small amount of blood from the arm and send it off for evaluation.\nIf the initial test shows a higher or lower number of white blood cells than normal, the doctor will likely repeat the test to confirm the results. If the initial results are confirmed, a doctor will perform a physical exam, ask questions about the person's lifestyle, and review their medical history.\nIf there is no apparent reason for changes in white blood cell levels, the doctor will order a more specific test. Laboratory specialists will look for specific white blood cells, such as immature neutrophils called myeloblasts. During an infection or chronic illness, these cells emerge from the bone marrow and mature in the blood instead of the bone marrow.\nIf myeloblasts or other white blood cells appear in significant levels in the blood, the doctor will request a bone marrow sample.\nBone marrow collection involves inserting a long needle into part of the pelvis near the back of your hip. The procedure can be very painful, and a doctor will typically take the sample in a hospital setting with at least a local anesthetic.\nExperts will examine the bone marrow sample to see if neutrophils and other blood cells are developing correctly and are in regular supply.\nLeukopenia is a condition where a person has a reduced white blood cell levels in their bloodstream. Learn about the causes, symptoms, and treatments here.\nChanges in neutrophil levels are often a sign of more significant changes in white blood cell levels.\nIn non-pregnant adults, a white blood cell blood count over 11,000 per mm3 is known as leukocytosis, which is an elevated white blood cell count. Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs when a person has over 7,000 per mm3 mature neutrophils in their bloodstream.\nMinor changes in neutrophil or white blood cell levels are typically nothing to worry about as long as they are temporary. A raised white blood cell count often means the body is responding to infection, injury, or stress.\nSome people have naturally lower levels of white blood cells and neutrophils than other people due to a range of factors, including congenital conditions.\nIf neutrophil or white blood cell levels are significantly altered for no apparent reason or remain raised or lowered, a doctor will order more tests to determine the cause.\nSeverely high or low levels of white blood cells often require emergency care and monitoring. People with severe neutropenia will have an inadequate defense against infection.\nPeople with severe neutrophilia typically have a life-threatening type of infection or other inflammatory illness that requires treatment, such as cancer.\nNutritional yeast is a plant-based source of vitamin B-12.\nThe best way to correct abnormal neutrophil levels is to address and treat the underlying cause.\nAntibiotics can treat bacterial infections, while antifungal medicine treats fungal infections. People can treat certain viral infections with medications that slow viral activity. Otherwise, supportive therapies, such as fluids and rest, may be part of the treatment plan.\nPeople with altered neutrophil levels caused by medications or procedures may need to stop or adjust treatments.\nPeople with severely low levels of neutrophils often require monitoring, antibiotic therapy, and hospitalization to reduce the risk of severe infection.\nThis period of intensive care helps keep people with weakened immune systems away from potentially harmful microorganisms. It also supports the body, giving it time to produce more white blood cells.\nTry not to over-exercise or exercise beyond comfort levels.\nReduce stress levels and treat chronic or severe stress.\nSeek medical attention for signs of infection, such as fever, weakness, fatigue, or pain, and treat infections exactly as prescribed.\nFollow a healthful, balanced diet.\nTreat chronic conditions, such as genetic or inflammatory conditions, exactly as prescribed.\nHowever, people with only minor or mild changes in their neutrophil blood levels often show no symptoms and do not require any treatment.\nHaving a healthy number of neutrophils in the blood and bone marrow is crucial to the correct working of the immune system.\nWhen neutrophil levels are higher or lower than usual for more than a short period, a doctor will order several tests to work out the underlying cause. People with significantly altered neutrophil levels may also require hospitalization to prevent infection and treat life-threatening conditions.\nIt is a good idea to have regular wellness checks at a doctor's office to stay on top of health. Anyone with concerns about their neutrophil count or any medical condition should talk to their doctor who will be able to answer questions they may have.\nHuizen, Jennifer. \"What are neutrophils and what do they do?.\" Medical News Today.

    "text": "Undoubtedly an ambitious project, the Lilypad seeks to be a completely self-sufficient floating city that will bring shelter to future climate change refugees. Drawing its inspiration from the highly ribbed leaf of the great lilypad of the Amazonia Victoria Regia, the city is also called the Floating Ecopolis and is designed to hold approximately 50,000 people. Designed by Vincent Callebaut, the Lilypad is a concept proposal to deal with the effects of global warming and the displacement of inhabitants who reside along the coastal lines. The double skin of the ecopolis is made of polyester fibres covered by a layer of titanium dioxide which would react with ultraviolet rays and absorb atmospheric pollution. It will also implement renewable technologies allowing it to produce more energy than it consumes. A centrally located artificial lagoon completely immersed below the water line will be surrounded by three marinas and three mountains to act as a stabilizer for the city. Biotic corridors and aquaculture farms would be used to grow food and biomass. Each city is intended to be either near a coast, or floating around in the ocean. Expected to be a reality in 2100, the project still has a very long way to go and may come in too late for climate change refugees.\nThe ability of the cactus plant to survive in harsh desert climate inspired the new design for Qatar\u2019s Minister of Municipal Affairs & Agriculture (MMAA) building. Borrowing from the plant\u2019s ability to transpire at night rather than the day in order to retain water, the building is covered with hundreds of smart shades that open and close depending on the strength of the sun. There is a dome at the base of the building that is home to a botanical garden which has an edible garden and uses plants to clean up waste water. The waste water passes through three different ecological systems that process and filters it in different ways. The botanical dome is also used for climate and air control, as well as a sustainable food source.\nTermites are reputed to be one of nature\u2019s best builders, erecting tall mounds and maintaining a constant temperature inside despite the external weather conditions. How do they perfect a system of a self-cooling ventilation system? The largest office and shopping complex in Zimbabwe, the East Gate Centre, borrows from this marvel having no air conditioning yet remaining cool. The East Gate Centre, largely made of concrete, draws in outside air that is either warmed or cooled by the building mass. Vented into the building\u2019s floors and offices, the air exits through the chimneys at the top. The complex also consists of two buildings side by side that are separated by an open space that is covered by glass and open to the local breezes. Minimizing its heating and cooling energy by 90%, the owners of the building were able to save up to $3.5 million for a $36 million building.\nOne of the fastest trains in the world, Japan\u2019s Shinkansen bullet train travels at over 200 miles per hour. It is also the world\u2019s busiest rail line, serving over 151 million passengers in a year. However, the engineers of the train faced a major challenge. When the high-speed train would pass through a tunnel, a cushion of air would build up and pushed along in front of the train. As the train would exit the tunnel, this compressed air would suddenly expand with a loud sonic boom. Eventually the engineers redesigned the model, borrowing from the kingfisher which is capable of diving from air into water seamlessly. The train\u2019s nose cone is modelled after a kingfisher\u2019s beak, creating a much quieter train. Not only does it help the train go faster but it also uses 15% less energy.\nThe tropical boxfish lives in warm ocean waters. While it has a rather large body, the fish is able to swim very fast because of its low coefficient of drag and rigid exoskeleton. Looking for a new aerodynamic design for a car, the designers set out to model a new vehicle, applying characteristics of the fish to the car. The result was a vehicle that recorded the lowest co-efficient of a drag ever tested. The Bionic Car was able to reach a top speed of 118 miles per hour. Not only did the aerodynamic shape give the car a highly efficient fuel performance, its rectangular frame also added stability.\nDeveloped by Boston Dynamics for the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the fastest legged robot dubbed the \u201cCheetah\u201d set a new land record speed for land robots at 18 miles per hour. The concept uses the natural flexing of both legs and back that a cheetah exhibits to increase its stride. A cheetah\u2019s spine is unusually flexible and it curves or flexes with each stride, acting like a spring for its hind legs. The current version of this robot runs on a laboratory treadmill where it is powered by an off-board hydraulic pump, and uses a boom-like device to keep it running in the centre of the treadmill.\nOrganic agriculture could eventually provide enough food to nourish the planet if developed on a large scale. Urban farming has become a growing trend among city inhabitants though in a place like Manhattan space to actually carry this through is a major challenge. With no way to go but up, Belgian architect, Vincent Callebaut, developed an incredible urban farm concept that mimics the design of the wings of a dragonfly. The space between the pair of \u201cwings\u201d can use solar energy production to accumulate warm air within the structure during winter months, and the design of the spine can efficiently separate and recirculate waste products from plants, humans and animals. Spanning 132 floors, the Dragonfly can accommodate 28 different agricultural fields for the production of fruit, vegetables, grains, meat and dairy.\nWithin the New Songdo City, a series of residential and commercial towers have arisen, drawing inspiration from the honeycomb. To achieve a twisting look yet preventing the tower from buckling in heavy winds, the structure is designed with supporting walls that stagger out and upward from the centre. Just like the hexagonal parts of a honeycomb, the supporting walls hug the core like puzzle pieces, creating a balanced and secure structure with no wasted space. Considered highly controversial for being constructed on an intertidal wetland, the properties consist of six 50-story towers, accommodate state-of-the-art technology, live-in work amenities and retail space; defining the northern edge of the city.\nA freely movable handling system, the Bionic Handling Assistant is inspired by the elephant trunk, developing a bionic arm. It combines a wide range of technologies and components \u2013 from manufacturing concepts to series products like sensors and valves, actuators and grippers, to control technology and software for developing applications and products. Its structural resilience allows for safe and direct contact between a person and the machine, forming a stronger and more efficient method of interaction between people and technology. The invention can be used in various situations that require support from machines such as medical technology, rehabilitation and as an aid for the handicapped, as well as in agriculture, private homes and educational institutes.\nThe Haitian kapok tree is able to store water internally and shed its leaves under drought conditions to conserve energy. As they embark to replace an orphanage that was ruined in the 2010 earthquake I Haiti, designers have sought inspiration from that tree to counter the rainy season and humid climate of the region. The centre\u2019s unique deep-set balcony system was modelled after the Kapok tree\u2019s branching support system. The Kapok\u2019s roots are represented by the facility\u2019s below-grade area, which will clean and store water. A porous bamboo layer protects the building\u2019s concrete core; the bamboo\u2019s high surface area and cell-like pockets circulate trade winds and deflect heat.",

    "text": "Week 10 | Fox Walkers at Fairhaven | Gratitude, Scout Skills, & Shelter Improvements!\nIt was so nice to be reunited with the Fox Walkers last week after we had the previous week off for Thanksgiving break!\nFollowing the stick drag trail that Pat left behind. . .\nEpic hiding spot/ tree \"ship\"\nPracticing our sneaking skills- rain pants are loud!\nWhich creature was nibbling these Hawthorn berries?\nLast week our morning games had a \u201csneaky/scouty\u201d focus to them. We enjoyed an exciting game of Otter Steals Fish, in which the Otters on the outside of the circle tried to steal the \u201cfish\u201d from the Great Blue Heron in the middle of the circle. We also played a game called Ninja, where one person is blindfolded while the rest of the group are \u201cninjas\u201d who quietly move around the circle, trying not to be detected/tagged. In addition, we played an impromptu scouting game where we practiced silently sneaking up to one person standing ahead of us. We observed how noisy our rain pants can be while we\u2019re trying to walk quietly, and we altered the way that we walked so that we didn\u2019t make so much noise. We took note of which outside noises gave us an advantage while we were sneaking, such as the sound of the pouring rain, the cars on the nearby road, and the train in the distance. We truly had a blast playing these scouting games!\nIn the spirit of the holiday season, the story of the week focused on expressing gratitude. In this story, Moon Bird and Running Deer were out on a forest adventure foraging for berries when they came across a bear who was crying because he was stuck in a hole. They eventually helped the bear by throwing it some freshly picked berries and lowering a log into the hole so that he could climb out. Although Moon Bird and Running Deer were a bit scared of the bear, they realized quickly that it was friendly creature who had a teaching to share with them, much like Mr. Big Cat did. The bear\u2019s name was Medicine Bear, and he taught Moon Bird and Running Deer the importance of expressing gratitude for all of the wonderful things that nourish them, especially the plants that give them yummy berries!\nDespite the epic rainfall last week, the Fox Walkers did not hesitate to have a blast out there in the forest. On Tuesday we explored the new trail in the park, met a 90-year old tree stump named \u201cStill Tree\u201d, blasted down the shorter Blast Off Hill (the new trail changed the hill a bit!), and followed Pat\u2019s stick drag trail to an epic downed tree that not only is perfect for hiding under, but also makes a great ship for sailing! On Thursday we spent lots of time gathering fallen leaves and transporting them to our shelter for additional insulation and weatherproofing. Our \u201cForest Home\u201d is looking good and feeling much more rain-resistant thanks to all of the leaves!\nWe\u2019re so blown away by the resiliency of this crew of kiddos. Despite the seemingly relentless cold and wet rain last week, we didn\u2019t hear any complaints at all! We're looking forward to much drier and warmer adventures at Fairhaven this week!",

    "text": "Save 33% On Your Energy Bill With A Programmable Thermostat\u2026 I Did!\nLooking to save a couple hundred dollars this year in about 30 minutes?\nInstall an EnergyStar certified programmable thermostat.\nAbout a year ago I decided to experiment with a programmable thermostat in my home. The result, after 1 year: big savings.\nMy energy company (and your\u2019s probably will too) gives me a side-by-side comparison of how many kWh of electricity I used in the current month and to the current month one year ago.\nThe best part is that I\u2019ve noticed a trend. My energy bills are significantly less each month this year than they were in the same month last year \u2014 especially as the temperature starts to rise.\nWhat Makes Programmable Thermostats So Great?\nProgrammable thermostats give you the ability to designate pre-programmed temperature changes in your home.\nWon\u2019t your home be sweltering if you even increase its temperature during the day by a measly 2 degrees in the summer?\nWell, yes\u2026 or no. It won\u2019t matter if you work a regular 9-to-5 job and no one is home during the day, but what if you have an irregular schedule due to working from home, having a swing shift, being a stay at home mom, etc? More on that later.\n7 Day Schedule \u2013 This allows you this most flexibility in your settings. With this feature (instead of the 5+2 or 5+1+1 schedule options) you can set all weekdays together with different weekend setting OR you can set each day to it\u2019s own program (works well if you have an irregular schedule and work from home, like I do).\nTemporary AND Vacation Hold \u2013 Temporary hold allows you to override the pre-programmed setting for a short period of time. The \u201chold\u201d will be canceled at the next pre-set cycle. Vacation hold allows you to suspend your current settings and implement a different, more efficient temperature setting while you\u2019re away for a few days. Best of all, your home will be back to normal on the day you return. Sweet huh?\nBackup Battery Power \u2013 It\u2019s a good idea to have this feature so that in the event of a power failure, you will not have to reprogram your thermostat.\nFor my home and specific HVAC system, I chose the Hunter 7-day programmable thermostat.\nIt has all the above mentioned features plus some other handy features. Perhaps one of my favorite additional features it has is an air filter monitor that reminds me when it\u2019s time to change the filter. This is vitally important to efficient heating and cooling!\nTwo of the most prominent manufacturers of programmable thermostats are Honeywell and Hunter.\nDon\u2019t make the mistake that I made and cost yourself more time and money.\nBefore installing your new programmable thermostat, shut off the power to your unit by flipping the breaker at BOTH your fuse box and indoor portion of your HVAC unit.\nIf you do that, you can install your new programmable thermostat in about 30 minutes.\nHave you ever had a programmable thermostat in your home? If so, how did you like it?",

    "text": "Diablo 3 Ultimate Evil Edition for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is an amazing game. From the opening minutes to the final showdown, the game is fun, frantic, and visually engaging. Diablo 3 has you choose a hero from one of the six classes available. They are Barbarian, Witch Doctor, Wizard, Monk, Demon Hunter, and the new class, Crusader. Following this, your story begins and you begin your quest to destroy all evil and anything that might look at you the wrong way.\nAs in the previous iterations, in Diablo 3, the X button is your best friend. So much so in fact, that you\u2019ll defeat hundreds of enemies with just that button. The core Diablo 3 experience is mostly the same as it was on last generation\u2019s consoles, with the exception of a few things. Firstly, there are new multipliers that grant you different bonuses. The one that you\u2019ll be seeing most is the kill multiplier, which made it fun to chain as many kills as possible and also earns you increased experience. Secondly, the increased frame rate is easily noticeable and makes the game run ridiculously smooth. I also sometimes stopped to admire the improved scenery. Thirdly, an adventure mode is now playable. Adventure mode is exactly what it sounds like and allows you to further explore areas in the game that you might have missed before. Also, you\u2019ll be able to undertake objective based missions. These are called bounties and are a fun way to seek treasure and experience. Lastly, there is the addition of Apprentice mode. Apprentice mode is a multiplayer mode that grants a lower level player extra experience when playing with a higher level player. I really like this idea and love the fact that you can essentially play with anyone now. Other than these three things, the core Diablo 3 game is identical to last generation\u2019s.\nIncluded in Ultimate Evil Edition is the rather new Reaper of Souls expansion. Reaper of Souls continues your hero\u2019s story as the Angel of Death makes a very strong effort to destroy humanity. This actually turned out to be my favorite part of the game. Take Diablo 3\u2019s gameplay, add more side areas and events, more weapons and armor, enemies, and a continuation of the story and you\u2019ve got Reaper of Souls. In addition to this expansion, UEE players will also get their hands on the new Crusader class, which can also be used throughout the entirety of Diablo 3\u2019s campaign. I found the Crusader to be an amazing class for anyone who likes close quarters combat. I actually favor him greatly over the Barbarian class.\nNow, while I really loved Ultimate Evil Edition, it does have some flaws that really took me out of the experience. It was extremely easy, even on hard mode. The only time I was actually defeated was during the last boss fight on Reaper of Souls. If you\u2019re looking for a difficult experience, be sure to turn the difficulty up to the highest. There was also quite a bit of enemy pop in. Sure, I know that enemies are supposed to randomly spawn, but they appeared out of thin air once or twice in every dungeon. This was easily overcome by my godlike character, but it\u2019s just not something to be expected now that we\u2019re in the new generation. While both of these seem extremely minor, they affected my playthroughs negatively and we\u2019re very unwelcome.\nWith everything being said, Diablo 3 Ultimate Evil Edition is the definitive Diablo experience and should be played by all PS4 and Xbox One owners that haven\u2019t already played it. The smooth hack n\u2019 slash gameplay is fun and addicting, the story is pretty solid, and the new online adventure mode is awesome. Oh, did I mention that Ultimate Evil Edition comes with Reaper of Souls and the Crusader class? Because it does and both of those are highlights of this game. Though I had gripes with the difficulty and random pop-ins, I\u2019m very pleased with this game and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",

    "text": "Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger.\nWhen a bolt of musical inspiration hits, many musicians will reach for their smart phones, pop open the built-in voice-recorder app, and make a quick recording of some combination of guitar, voice or piano, hoping to capture the essence of the idea before it fades.\nBut a voice memo is a blunt tool for capturing a song idea, and the artist is left on their own to figure out how to translate a rough recording into something more substantial -- or even to remember what chords were played.\nPress this big button to record.\nEnter Music Memos, a new iOS app from Apple. This simple app is a new type of voice-memo recorder, built around capturing musical ideas, giving them a slight polish, and sending the best ones on to a more powerful music tool, such as Apple's own GarageBand or Logic Pro. It's completely free, and should be available on the App Store later today.\nMusic Memos starts with a simple record button in the middle of the screen. Tap it and the app starts recording -- it's optimized for guitar or piano, but you could really record anything: voice, ukulele, klezmer, whatever, although other instruments may miss out on some of the advanced features.\nTrim and loop the recording and edit the chord information here.\nIt's what happens next that makes Music Memos stand out from a standard memo-recording app. If you recorded some acoustic guitar or piano, Music Memos analyses the audio input and attempts to chop your song demo into bars, in the appropriate time signature, and then adds chord labels.\nYou can tweak the recording a good deal, trimming the start and end to form a loop, and overwriting the chord information with your own notations. In practice, I found it worked best with strummy, coffee-shop open chords in 4/4 time. Trying to get a little more complex, such as throwing in jazzy major-7th chords, forced me to manually enter the appropriate chords for each bar.\nSongs can be exported to GarageBand or shared via services including SoundCloud and email.\nBut once that's all set, you can turn on the surprisingly satisfying auto-accompaniment tools, and a simple bass line and drum track will follow along with the rhythm and chords, like a bare-bones backing band. It offers just a few basic beats, and again seems targeted at the strummy, coffee-shop singer-songwriter crowd, but it's also very satisfying to hear a fleshed-out version of a song idea almost instantly.\nSong ideas can also be labeled with tags, and you can add comments or even song lyrics to a notes section for each recording. Music Memo recordings can be synced to iCloud, or you can export the actual files to GarageBand or Logic Pro in order to work on them further in a more full-featured music app.\nThe next step up from Music Memos is GarageBand, Apple's consumer-friendly music recording and editing program. Included on most iOS and OS X devices, it takes an iMovie-like approach to recording, throwing out some of the traditional user interfaces found in programs such as ProTools or Apple's own Logic Pro (which were, in turn, copied from actual real-world recording studios), and instead creating a new, hopefully more intuitive, way to record music.\nHaving used old-school music DAWs (shorthand for \"digital audio workstations,\" a term used to describe computer-based recording programs) such as ProTools and Logic extensively over the years, I've always found the GarageBand approach hard to wrap my head around. But, this new 2.1 update adds some interesting new features that make it easier than ever to get started crafting or arranging music, even if you have little or no experience.\nThe Live Loops interface in GarageBand.\nThe most notable is an entirely new (and entirely optional) interface called Live Loops. It's a performance-friendly sequencer for arranging samples and loops, which can be lined up to play in order, or simply triggered on the fly by tapping on the appropriate square-shaped loop. Apple includes several preloaded templates in different music genres, or you can start with a blank field and import various loops and samples, or original recordings made in GarageBand. With the right tempo and note information (routinely included with commercial samples and loops) the Live Loops interface keeps all the parts in sync and flowing together naturally.\nThe idea reminds me of performance-friendly music programs such as Ableton Live, but this version is much more pick-up-and-play, and my four-year-old was having a great time with it, triggering samples and creating on-the-fly arrangements in under a minute. Live Loops is fun to play with, but probably more useful for live improvisation from the DJ booth or creating EDM arrangements than traditional songwriting and recording.\nOutside of Live Loops, there's also the standard music recording and editing tools in GarageBand, augmented by some new automation features and EQ tools for tweaking the overall sound.\nYou can still record audio via an external mic or your device's built-in mic (although the latter is not really recommended) or play virtual guitars and keyboards on-screen, which is fun but involves a lot of trial and error to get a feel for. \"Smart\" versions of these instruments will play preset patterns based on chord information you provide. That can give you an instant backing band for ideas, but again, there's a robotic sameness to the performances and the styles are on the dry side, so it's not going to replace calling your musically talented friends up and asking them to play on your album.\nNew for GarageBand 2.1 is the addition of Drummer, a high-concept AI drum tool previously found only in the $200 Logic Pro software. Drummer starts with several fictional drummer profiles, each with his or her own music genres and drum kits, and builds a drum track for your song that can be adjusted on the fly to be louder, softer, more or less complex, using different cymbal or kick/snare variations, and with more or fewer fills. The end result is pretty good, and much more human-feeling than basic drum loops or samples. Although, again, the genre choices tend to run towards EDM, straightforward rock, and commercial-sounding hip-hop/R&B. I'm still waiting for a specialized bossa nova drummer, or a virtual version of Bernard Purdie.\nThe Drummer app inside GarageBand.\nMusic Memos is for free for iOS users and will work on iPhone 4s and later, and iPad 2 and later. GarageBand 2.1 for iOS will be included on new iOS devices with 32GB or more of storage, and owners of previous versions can upgrade for free if they have iOS 9.",

    "text": "Sant Satguru Sadhu Ram in a talk/satsang given this evening, New Delhi, India time, quoted his Guru, Sant Satguru Ajaib Singh ji: This (spiritual) path is sharper than the edge of sword.\nThen Sadhu Ram ji said: It\u2019s easier to climb on (get on) the cross than to carry on with love (It\u2019s more difficult to maintain living this life with love.) (Yet) Love is very close by, within.\nSatguru\u2019s Court is more beautiful than everything else. There is no other door like this one. Satguru\u2019s Court is more beautiful than everything else.\nHe puts the forgetful ones on the straight path. He makes the lost souls meet the Creator. Come, those who want to make their life successful.\nHe has made the likes of the dirt of the alleys successful. I, the lowly one, am embraced by the Higher Ones. One will not find such a Master.\nAjaib Ji has cast His gracious sight. He has filled the empty jholi of Sadhu Ram. I will never lose the gifts You have given me.\nSo please, why not throw something into my begging bowl?\nWhy is Rumi begging from His \u067e\u06cc\u0631? Because this physical reality is too harsh, even for Saints like Rumi as they compose poems. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s behind all this \u201cMaya\u201d or illusion unless the Guru \u067e\u06cc\u0631 and the \u201cWord\u201d or \u201cNaam\u201d put us in the state of consciousness where we simply absorb true knowledge and feel the love that has created and sustains all.\nWe\u2019re dyed in the color of this world but the ones who are initiated by a perfect master, Guru \u0645\u0631\u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644\u060c \u067e\u06cc\u0631 learn how dyed their mind in the color of Naam. It comes in Gurubani that it is only by getting dyed in the color of Naam we can reach salvation. So we pray that we may be intoxicated with Naam so we can be one with uOu.\nPoem above is by Rumi and \u0622\u0631\u0634 \u062a\u0628\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc has given his interpretation of the poem in Persian. Basically they are saying that most people don\u2019t see this world as reality and don\u2019t look behind the invisible curtain. And the ones who do look and see are either considered mad, crazy or mentally disoriented. But Rumi is saying wait a second \u0627\u0648\u0633\u062a \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u0634\u062f \u2018the one who hasn\u2019t gone mad is the mad one\u2019.\nYour body is the temple of God, O man, Satguru is sitting inside. You will not find anything outside, everything is inside you, O man.\nYou clean and sweep the temples made of stones and bricks, you ring bells and conch every day, you burn incense to add fragrance. What benefit does outer bathing do, inside you the ocean is flowing, O man.\nYou read Vedas, Puranas and Granths, but you have never practiced. His will is understood by those who have won over the mind and the world. Even after winning the entire world, Sikandar (Alexander the Conqueror) left empty handed, O man.\nI meditated on Satguru Ajaib\u2019s Naam and I saw God. Sadhu Ram woke up in the ambrosial hour and took a dip within. The body and the mind became pure, I became intoxicated and carefree, O man.\nMind, the very essence of Kal, has wrecked the garden through force, violence and hierarchy in religion.\nWhen will this mind surrender and when will this ego leave me be?\nSatguru ji, \u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0631\u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644, please take these coverings off my soul by showering your grace.\nYou\u2019re the light of all lights Master, \u0627\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0631 \u0645\u0646, my salvation in your hands.\nLet\u2019s cover up my faults behind this wine stained initiation rope for, uOu, my Guru \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u060c is coming. And I might get a chance to be forgiven, I\u2019m sure I will, by the shower of uOs grace I\u2019ll be cleansed once again even for just a moment.\nIf you know some Persian Google the poem in Persian and enjoy reading the whole poem.\nI don\u2019t care if you call me an infidel. I\u2019ll be an infidel of Love if I don\u2019t worship Shamms.\nHe\u2019s openly referring to his deep devotion to his \u067e\u06cc\u0631 Master. But \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez is more loved in Iran, his book of poetry in almost every house, because the codes he used such \u201cpray\u201d in the verse above can be interpreted in many ways; give me a good job, a good spouse, etc, to give me a taste of your Divine Love for that is all I need.\n\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez means the one who has memorised all of Quran/Koran. \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 comes from \u062d\u0641\u0638 memory, something we all have as well as the potential to memorize a whole book line by line. So when in a last verse we hear the word \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez, especially in Persian, we don\u2019t just think about the poet, the mystic, the Master who wrote the poem, we hear that potential within us to be \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez. The last line of the stanza where \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 Hafez often uses his name as if reminding himself is in fact a message to us, at the level of our individual capacity to be with the Divine.\nHey gardener what\u2019s going on?\nWhy are you giving me so much trouble?\nIf I\u2019ve taken some of your grapes you\u2019re taking away my stomach.\nThe Ocean of Love or The Anurag Sagar of Kabir is epic poem which \u201ccenters around the impact of Time on Eternity and Eternity\u2019s response. It is Eternity which is the anurag sagar, or \u201cocean of love,\u201d and it\u2019s Time\u2019s perversion of that part of Eternity which it touches which produces the bhav sagar, \u201cocean of the world\u201d \u2013 the only reality most of us know, the mock world we are trapped in.\nThe creator of the bhava sagar, \u201c the butcher Kal\u201d (Kal means, literally, Time) is mad: one of the sons of Eternity (San Purush, Ture or Original Person), Kal or Time was unable to handle the separation from his father that the creation process demanded, and went mad. Ignoring the wishes of Eternity, he misused the tools of creation entrusted to him and, through his impatience and megalomania, created a sewer where a garden was intended. Convinced that he is God, demanding to be worshiped as God, and setting up a Law so stringent that no one can keep it,he presides to his day over a closed-circuit universe that would be utterly without hope if it were not for the fact that, as the poet Blake puts it, \u201cEternity is ever in love with the product of Time.\u201d Because Eternity does love those of us caught in the trap of Time, It has set up a series of invasions in which the true Reality enters into the mock universe and illumines it, awakening those who are ready to gasp the truth and showing the the way out.\nHow much my body has suffered, only True Satguru knows. If you meet a Perfect Master only then the soul reaches the true destination.\nMay my body and mind become a mirror so I could have the Darshan of my Master.\nNot even after dying, could I forget the favors of my Master.\nI could never feel satisfied looking at Him, His Darshan to me is like millions of pilgrimages. I bow down to pay respect to my Satguru.\nFor Whom this life is suffering, only He knows what is in my heart. No one has the medicine for this ailment; my affliction is for my Master.\nThe sleep does not come into my eyes, Your remembrance torments me. Even today these two eyes are only waiting for the Master.\nIn the end, Ajaib will save Sadhu Ram and take him across. The court of the Master never disappears from my eyes.\nRepeat the Unrepeated and with the grace of the Perfect Master, test it.\nKeeping the wing of mind at rest, see the Shabda; and climbing the mind, finish you Karma.\nMerging into the Essential Shabda, go to the world of immortality.\nTo die while still alive, to reach the state of Samati, has been the goal and the message of the Masters. Rumi is talking about the kind of death which erases his sense of ego and the desire to die in that sense, he says, has kept him alive and now old.\nThen he uses the metaphor of a wheat grain which has the potential to be sowed and turned into a plant and more wheat produced from it which shows the ego of the seed, no matter how small to us human beings, nevertheless an identity and ego of a seed. But once it enters the mills and gets crushed into flour it loses its identity as a seed. It has the potential to become part of a loaf of bread but it\u2019s individual seed ego is no longer recognizable. It can become one with the bread. And once a Master enters the state of Samati and loses the ego, uOu becomes one with the Beloved, the Creator, the all Compassionate and Merciful. Finally the Master comes back from the state of Samati and fully occupies the body with all it\u2019s worldly senses (touch, smell, taste, sight, etc.) and gets the minimal ego needed to identity with the body. The Master may not enjoy this \u201cnormal state\u201d as much as the state of samati but the disciples are elated to be in presence of the One who has been drenched with love and compassion in the field beyond the ideas of right-doing and wrong-doing and has come to shower them with that grace.\nThe Persian word \u0634\u06cc\u0631 means milk as well as lion. One who reads this verse in Persian could on a subliminal level think of the hair as the metaphor for part the person, the strength of a person. Hence Rumi might also be saying; If I become as daring and strong as a lion then I could enter the state of Samati.\nThe more practical part of our brain will say that Rumi is talking about getting old so of course he\u2019s talking about the color of milk and hair turning white as we age. However just the fact that this idea crossed my mind that he might also be referring to lion, shows me the power of Rumi\u2019s poetry if read in a delightful Persian language and especially if we get lucky to have a day or even an especial hour to contemplate on one or two of His verses.\nFrom a talk, Satsang, given by Sant Sadhu Ram on January 01, 2004 in New Delhi, India.\nSaints and Masters have in one way or another tried to say the same thing but in different languages and ways according to their circumstances and the way they were assigned to give that message. From the word of mouth and the translations this is what Jesus said, \u201cI\u2019m the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved\u201d \u2013 while He was alive, in the body. Jesus wasn\u2019t afraid to die and neither was Hafez. The Middle Eastern folks has shown that they\u2019re into martyrdom and it\u2019s a blessing if \u201cGod\u201d is willing. Hafez was to write poetry in a delicate way instead of having his head chopped off by the clergy \u2013 and to write in such a beautiful way in such a beautiful language to reveal the secret behind the curtain in a way that the clergy couldn\u2019t accuse Him of blasphemy even though some tried. And Jesse had another mission before He was put on the cross and returned to His Father\u2019s Home at such young age.",

That's why it's important to consider the both growth rate and dividend payout ratio. But long-term investors who are saving for retirement, a child's college fund, or even to pass assets down to their descendants will want to consider dividend growth above all else. Below are two rock-solid companies with fast-growing payouts that are likely to be dividend powerhouses decades from now.\nIn the span of one generation, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has gone from a small coffee chain to the second-biggest restaurant company in the world, behind McDonald's. Plenty of jokes have been made over the years about the company's ubiquity, but it continues to expand aggressively, adding more than 2,000 stores last year to top 25,000 worldwide. Like Starbucks, Nike(NYSE:NKE) dominates its industry, and has crushed the market over the long term. With its brand and distribution advantages, and its leadership in athletic footwear, Nike is likely to continue to outperform the market.\nI'm considering SBUX for baby DivHut's portfolio for the same reason you write about... continued growth for a while longer.",

Where was police and Comelec capabilities.?\nSince the imposition of the gun ban last week, authorities arrested only one person for illegal possession of firearm and eleven guns were seized.\nThe election gun ban is from January 13 to June 12, 2019. Prohibited during the period is carrying of firearms and weapons, hiring of bodyguards, and transportation of firearms, explosives, spare parts and raw materials. Meanwhile, the issuance, approval and release of firearms, permit to carry guns, mission orders and memorandum receipts of law enforcement agencies are suspended.\nThose found guilty of violating the gun ban can be imprisoned from 1 to 6 years, deportation and permanent disqualification from public office and loss of the right to vote.\nHowever, the checkpoints in Basay, San Jose, Vallehermoso, Siaton, Jimalalud, Bacong, Valencia, Amlan, Zamboanguita and Guihulngan City only managed to recover the ten guns purportedly thrown on the road by motorcycle riders who evaded capture.\nIllegal possession of guns and ammunition is punisheable with 18 years in jail. So the illegal holders opted to throw the guns away on the road and evaded arrest. Did the police do a hot pursuit? It remains to be confirmed.\nIn contrast, a 39-year-old suspect identified as Dede Nosal was arrested in Barangay Dawis, Bayawan City for carrying a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver 10 live bullets for different types of handguns. The suspect, a resident of Barangay Kalamtukan, Bayawan City was intercepted and accosted for having in his possession an unlicensed firearm.\nIn sum, 6 pieces of .38 caliber pistols, 3 pieces .357 revolver and .22 caliber pistol along with 22 live were recovered by the roadsides near the areas where the checkpoints were established.",

    "text": "Artist rendering of Jason-3 satellite over the Amazon.\nThe Jason-3 oceanographic satellite is planned to launch on Sunday 17th January from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, aboard the Space-X Falcon 9 rocket. Named after the Greek hero Jason, of the Argonauts fame, Jason-3 is actually the fourth in a series of joint US-European missions to measure ocean surface height. The series began with the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite launched in 1992, followed by Jason-1 and Jason-2 which were launched in 2001 and 2008 respectively.\nJason-3 should provide a global map of sea surface height every ten days, which will be invaluable to scientists investigating circulation patterns and climate change.\nThe primary instrument is the Poseidon-3B radar altimeter, which will measure the time it takes an emitted radar pulse to bounce off the ocean\u2019s surface and return to the satellite\u2019s sensor. Pulses will be emitted at two frequencies: 13.6 GHz in the Ku band and 5.3 GHz in the C band. These bands are used in combination due to atmospheric sensitivity, as the difference between the two frequencies helps to provide estimates of the ionospheric delay caused by the charged particles in the upper atmosphere that can time delay the return.\nOnce the satellite has received the signal reflected back, it will be able to use its other internal location focussed instruments to provide a highly accurate measurement of sea surface height. Initially the satellite will be able to determine heights to within 3.3cm, although the long-term goal is to reduce this accuracy down to 2.5cm. In addition, the strength and shape of the return signal also allows the determination of wave height and wind speed which are used in ocean models to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents together the amount and location of heat stored in the ocean.\nIn addition, Jason-3 carries an Advanced Microwave radiometer (AMR) which measures altimeter signal path delay due to tropospheric water vapour.\nDORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) \u2013 Uses a ground network of 60 orbitography beacons around the globe to derive the satellite\u2019s speed and therefore allowing it\u2019s precise position in orbit to be determined to within three centimetres.\nLaser Retroreflector Array (LRA) \u2013 An array of mirrors that provide a target for laser tracking measurements from the ground. By analysing the round-trip time of the laser beam, the satellite\u2019s location can be determined.\nGlobal Positioning System \u2013 Using triangulation from three GPS satellites the satellites exact position can be determined.\nThe importance of extending the twenty-year time series of sea surface measurements cannot be underestimated, given the huge influence the ocean has on our atmosphere, weather and climate change. For example, increasing our knowledge of the variations in ocean temperature in the Pacific Ocean that result in the El Ni\u00f1o effect \u2013 which have caused coral bleaching, droughts, wet weather and movements in the jet stream in 2015, and are expected to continue into this year \u2013 will be hugely beneficial.\nThis type of understanding is what Jason-3 is setting sail to discover.\nThis entry was posted in Data, Earth Observation, NASA, Oceans, Remote Sensing, Research, Space Can Help, Space Industry, Understanding Space, Water Height Altimetry and tagged altimeter, Earth Observation, El Ni\u00f1o, global map, Jason 2, Jason 3, Jason-1, NASA, oceans, Poseidon, Poseidon-3B, radiometer, remote sensing, sea surface height, Topex, wave height, wave speed by Andy.

    "text": "I wrote this original post at the end of December last year, as I had decided to begin setting monthly, weekly and daily goals using some planning sheets I created. Posting them here at the blog is a means of \"accountability\", so to speak, although I honestly despise that word. Maybe it's just me, but do we really need someone to hold our hand and make sure we do the right thing? I mean, by my age, anyway. But that's a post for another day.\nSo today, I am going to review my goals and see what I have accomplished.\nI did this and it has made a HUGE difference in the flow of our tiny apartment. Bill has more closet space, and while a few things are cramped, in this space it is inevitable for the time being. But, what is cramped is the stuff we use less, as in, not on a daily basis, and the important day to day things are better situated. I also got rid of a TON of stuff, and while I still have more downsizing to do, I'm off to a great start!\nI wasn't able to get to this either, well. not in the way I had hoped anyway. But again, between being sick and a number of personal family matters that came up towards the end of the month, I'm ok with that. I was able to sit down and line out ideas for more than 100 posts that I'll be writing over the next year, and that has me really excited!\nPart of the problem with my craft supplies is that they are currently in bins under my bed and not that easy to retrieve, so out of sight, out of mind. I considered setting up a \"craft area\", but in our tiny open concept apartment, I'm afraid it would look too busy/messy. So, still working on the solution to this.\nThis is the only goal that I am upset about not reaching. Mind you, with my cold has come a headache, and I honestly have not felt like reading. But I am going to be honest and say that other things like Facebook (**COUGH**) have taken up precious time that I could have devoted to this goal. So, DO BETTER IN FEBRUARY! I was going to double up my reading for February to **catch up**, but I'm going to show myself some grace and just try to reach the goal of 4 books in for the month.\n*I did post here at the blog, maybe not M-W-F every week, and I did manage to get a few things posted on FB, Twitter and even began posting on Pinterest. Instagram needs some attention, however, and I need to get better at this.\n- Quiet Time - x A-W-F-U-L, can I be honest and tell you that I get pulled in my phone (clock), to easily????? Please tell me I'm not alone here!\n- Walk (M / W / F ) x - but I did go on four hikes!\nBasically I FAILED my daily habits. Grace. Grace. Grace. It's an accomplishment that I even have a written list of daily habits to fail to accomplish!\nThis one didn't happen. I was just too sick and too busy, but thankfully I have great friends who understand.\n- Create a \"Morning Basket\" x - Still want to do this!\n- Establish a daily routine for blogging and related social media. - Not a routine exactly, but I lined up more than 100 posts!\n- Set up a little area for crafting and organize my crafting materials. - Decided against this.\n- Coffee Shops - set aside at least one day this month to work on my blog at a coffee shop. x - Still want to do this! Maybe next month!\n- Lunch alone - have lunch alone at a quaint sandwich shop. x - Still want to do this! Maybe next month!\n- Weekly manicure / pedicure at home. - Set up a kit with all the necessary supplies that is easily accessible. x - Still want to do this!\n- De-tox? - still researching this one. x - Still want to do this!\nSo there you have it. I'm not particularly happy with the results, but as I said, I HAVE been sick for weeks and am just now beginning to feel a little better! I am sure if I can actually implement some of the health changes I have lined out, I will begin feeling even stronger, and I also need to get my sleep schedule regulated. I wake up a t 5:00 a.m. on the dot every morning, but tend to fall asleep between 7-10 p.m. every night and then I'm up again for several hours. I'm putting that on the list for February and researching ways to combat it. 5:00 a.m. wake up is fine with me, and to get 8 hours of sleep that does mean a 9:00 p.m. bed time. But Bill and Kate often don't get off of work and home until 10:00/10:30 and I like to be awake to greet them, so if I could work out 10-6 or 11-7, that would be great! I also don't mind only getting six hours of sleep, that is actually about the norm for me, I just want six C-O-N-S-E-C-U-T-I-V-E hours, not in 3 hour shifts!\nSo there you have it, my honest review of my January 2019 goals! I'll be posting my goals for February on Monday, if you are interested, and then next month I'm going to try to have them up before the first!",

This process includes the sale of the property by the mortgage holder without courtroom supervision. Some sift via public foreclosure notices in newspapers and on the Internet while others evaluate public information at the local courthouse.\nWhen the sheriff sale is carried out, the sale value will likely be used to pay the taxes first, then the mortgage, then any second mortgage and other liens. It\u2019d take a couple of attempts as these agent are very busy, but it surely value it as a result of they\u2019ll get you within the door with the banks that have forclosed homes.\nI do know that is unrealistic because greed causes folks to want interest upon interest to allow them to make more cash that they do not need which leads to greed. All the foreclosure course of have to be documented throughout the New Jersey court system. The eviction process begins when the new house owners of the property reveal to the courts that they are now the house owners and have the appropriate of possession of the property.\nBy tapping into a credit information bureau, credit score grantors get complete image of the payment history of a borrower.

So comfortable, I can't get out of it in the morning. ;-) He even delivered the mattress FREE.\nThanks Mike, you're a life saver!\n5 starWe were looking for a full size mattress for our son, but did not want to spend a lot of money. I saw a sign for Sage and we decided to check it out. Mike was very nice to work with. Mike was extremely knowledgeable about mattresses. We got a great deal and next day delivery. We will definitely be recommending Sage to others!\n5 starI've now purchased 2 mattresses from Mike the most recent for my daughter. After realizing the new mattress was a lot higher than her old one he ordered her a low profile box spring for no additional charge. The quality of his product and his customer service are top notch. Would definitely recommend him to friends and family.\n5 starWe got our new mattress at Sage yesterday. The store is unassuming from the outside but inside the staff are friendly and knowledgeable The mattresses are excellent and there is no pressure or rush. Spent last night on the new mattress and it is so nice. We got the somerton, I have chronic pain issues and this is the best sleep I have had in a long time. When we figure out what we need for furniture Sage will be where we go! Keep up the good work, Mike!\n5 starIf you want OUTSTANDING customer service and the absolute BEST price for a quality mattress, I strongly recommend Mike Sages's Home Furnishing store! Wow! So completely impressed!\n5 starGREAT customer service and great prices! Mike takes the time to explain all of your options so you know what you are buying beforehand. He is very informative and never pushy - I felt completely comfortable the entire time. His prices are unbeatable and his service is outstanding! I would highly recommend Sage Home Furnishings!!\n5 starAbsolutely love this place, friendly and help me with the mattress I wanted. I absolutely would buy more.\n5 starI had a truly awesome experience at Sage Home Furnishings. I got exactly what I wanted for a lower price than everywhere else I looked, including the delivery. Even better, the quality of the mattress I bought was even better than I remembered it from the show floor. I will definitely purchase from Mike again, and highly recommend Sage Home Furnishings.\n\"Fantastic service, excellent selection of mattresses. Great prices. My wallet & back both thank Sage Home Furnishings! :)\" Jay Mitchell Jr.\nWe love the new bed, it was VERY comfortable and we slept really well through the night and woke up with no more pain. The service with Mike is wonderful. He was willing to take time to help us to understand the finance works and making sure we understand without no confusion. He is a wonderful man to work with and I recommended the new customers to Mike and he will guide you to the right place.\n\"I think that I was one of Mike's first customers. I found his ad on Craigslist, and figured I would try a vendor outside of the standard retail establishments. I am glad I did.\nThe prices on his post were quite competitive compared to everything else that I saw online. My wife and I had just purchased a new home, and needed new furniture, so this seemed to be an obvious fit.\nMike made it clear right out of the gate that he has plenty of experience in furniture retail, but doesn't agree with many of its standard practices. He walked us through the products on his (then still in development) showroom floor. He has a range of products, but made it clear that the range is focused on price with a default towards quality.\nOnce we decided on the right king-sized TLC mattress, Mike worked with us on the pricing and delivery. CC payment was no problem. Mike and his teammate showed up a couple of days later and carefully delivered the mattress and box spring, and into a great night's sleep we went.\nThe interesting part was a couple of days later when I ran to BJ's Wholesale to grab a cheapo queen set for the guest room. Their prices were easily twice what Mike's were! Having seen his products already, I walked out of BJ's, called Mike, and asked him to add a queen set to the order. Mike showed up again a couple of days later with the second set, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.\nI recently had the pleasure of purchasing a new mattress and box spring. Mike was knowledgable about his product and answered all of my questions. Financing was easy. I had been to a few other mattress locations and found their high pressure approach bothersome when I told them I was just looking. I felt just as comfortable with my sales experience as my new purchase.\nMy boyfriend and I recently moved to Syracuse from Washington DC and were search of a good mattress for our guest bedroom. Because it was a spare bedroom, we were not trying to pay a fortune.\nWe ran across this store and was pleasantly surprised by the owner and his dedication to selling quality mattresses. He guided us through the entire purchase. I had so many questions- and he answered every single one!\nIt was a very new experience for us and we were not familiar with the area. He even delivered the mattress!\nMoving has been stressful. But this store was one less hassle and I felt very confident about our purchase.\nIf you are in search of a good quality mattress- this is the place you need to be!",

Mitch McConnell can rectify this immediately,\" Stewart said, noting that the Kentucky pol sponsored a health care bill for nuclear energy workers that has cost $11 billion.\n\"How in good conscience can you deny them the very thing that you have proudly brought to the people of your state? Please, personally ask him that,\" Stewart said.\nMcConnell ignored questions about his role in blocking the legislation after a press conference Tuesday. His spokesman denied he was the roadblock.\nSept. 11 advocate John Feal said the group met with McConnell Wednesday and he promised to include Zadroga in an omnibus budget bill, but said money must still be found to pay for it.\nCongress let the World Trade Center Health Program expire in September. The program has enough money to continue treatment for responders suffering from cancer and respiratory disease caused by Ground Zero toxins for now, but it will run out if the feds don't renew it.\nBackers want a permanent reauthorization.\n\"Men and women who answered the call of duty after the gravest terrorist attack in our nation's history stood there on the pile looking for survivors, finding remains, doing the horrible work of cleaning up after such a loss \u2014 all the while breathing in so many deadly toxins that are now killing them,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).\n\"They came because they are patriots. They came before they are heroes. So what is Congress doing today? Nothing. The answer is nothing.\"\nStill, she vowed to get the bill over the finish line before Congress leaves town for the holidays.\n\"We are moving this bill,\" she said. \"What we need from our Senate and House leadership is exactly that \u2014 leadership.\"",

    "text": "D&D Fourth Edition License Unveiled!\nAfter much hullabaloo, the open licensing for D&D Fourth Edition (4e) has been unveiled \u2013 kinda.\nWizards of the Coast is pleased to announce that third-party publishers will be allowed to publish products compatible with the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition game system under the new Dungeons & Dragons 4E Game System License (D&D 4E GSL). This royalty-free license will replace the former d20 System Trademark License (STL), and will have a System Reference Document (SRD) available for referencing permissible content.\nThe D&D 4E GSL will allow third-party publishers to create roleplaying game products in fantasy settings with the D&D 4th Edition rules, and publishers who register with WotC will be granted the right to use a version of the D&D logo that denotes the product as compatible with the D&D 4th Edition Roleplaying Game, in accordance with WotC\u2019s terms and conditions. The effective start date for sales of D&D 4E GSL publications will be October 1, 2008.\nThe license associated SRD will be available on June 6, 2008, at no cost. A small group of publishers received advanced notice and will receive these documents prior to June 6, at no cost, in order to prepare for publication of compatible materials by the effective start date. If you haven\u2019t already been contacted by WotC, you will be able to access the documents on the Wizards website beginning on June 6, 2008.\nWizards is also working on the details of a second royalty-free license, the d20 Game System License (d20 GSL). This license will allow third-party publishers to create roleplaying game products in non-fantasy settings with the 4E rules. The exact details for the d20 GSL will be released as they become available.\nI\u2019ve posted some questions to get clarification \u2013 it\u2019s not clear what this means for individuals and also begs some questions about how restrictive it\u2019ll be. More as I get it!\nThis entry was posted in talk and tagged 4e, D&D, GSL, license, open gaming, RPG, RPGs. Bookmark the permalink.\nOK, updates courtesy of Scott Rouse.\n1. Individuals will need to send in a \u201creply card\u201d accepting the license, then they can publish.\n2. Though the publisher start date is October 2008, you can make \u201cfree\u201d stuff earlier.\n3. The intent for what products are allowed is the full gamut \u2013 the D&D GSL will be like the current d20 STL.\n4. The d20 GSL \u2013 which will be kinda like the current OGL \u2013 allowing non-D&D d20 games \u2013 will outlaw other medieval fantasy games but allow other genres.",

    "text": "October\u2019s almost over, so it\u2019s that time of the year again. No, we\u2019re not talking about Christmas. We\u2019re not talking about All Saints\u2019 Day or All Souls Day either. We\u2019re talking about Halloween, an occasion that\u2019s celebrated by zombie lovers, Twilight fans, and enthusiastic kids whose love for candy is matched only by their love for wearing costumes. If you live in a condo community, chances are the young ones in your area are abuzz, and the unit owners\u2014yourself included\u2014are busy thinking of the best Halloween condo design ideas to set the proper mood. We\u2019ve already gone through some awesome Halloween condo design ideas, but why don\u2019t we step up the elegance this time around?\nOf course, as a condo renter, you probably have certain aesthetic standards that you want to adhere to. Cobwebs, skeletons, and black and yellow balloons are pass\u00e9, but honestly, nobody will say they\u2019re chic or tasteful\u2014at least not the way most people do them. Halloween is a time for trick-or-treating, and the real trick is to find Halloween decorating ideas that won\u2019t disrupt the elegant feel of your condo unit. If this is your Mission: Impossible for this year, then read on.\nYou\u2019re probably sick of all the articles on the Internet telling you to use candles to make your house look spooky, as if people haven\u2019t been doing that since even before the Internet was created. So why not put a bit more craftsmanship into it? Take advantage of the candles\u2019 waxy, moldable nature, and try playing around with them. You can carve them into shapes or embed little design ornaments to make them look unique. This is sure to grab your guests\u2019 attention!\nSure, you can put that candy in a plain glass bowl. Or you can put them in decorative mason jars for a little style. Arrange your candies as tastefully as you can, and if you want to add an aura of creepiness, simple touches like putting them in an old wooden crate can pay dividends.\nTo give trick-or-treaters a little extra joy, consider making Halloween treats from scratch. You can put in awesome and whimsical touches, like baking Tim-Burton-themed goodies and placing plastic insects on the plates. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re out of ideas or can\u2019t bake like a master chef\u2014there are plenty of Halloween treat recipes for you to try.\nOf course, who can think of Halloween without thinking of pumpkins? The really artistic and skillful can take a whole pumpkin or squash and carve it into a traditional jack-o\u2019-lantern. If you\u2019re less confident in your ability to handle sharp tools, you can just take the easy way out and simply paint a few squashes white and black. Trust us, the effect is really striking!\nIf you have a few lamps in your unit, you can try embellishing them for All Hallow\u2019s Eve by dressing them up a little. The lampshade is a blank canvas that people often overlook. You can paint it, draw on it or even stick cool decals to create striking patterns. Just think about what Halloween motif you\u2019d like to apply\u2014black cats? bats? a full moon?\u2014and make it happen.\nLooking for a dramatic flourish? Black and silver are a classic horror movie combination. If you\u2019ve been dying for an excuse to show off your silverware, then Halloween is a good occasion to do it. Polish your silver and pair it with black accent pieces to get a look that would make any vampire proud.\nStudio condo design is challenging enough on its own\u2014trying to achieve a creepy yet fun look for trick-or-treaters adds another layer of difficulty. If you\u2019re looking for a new yet simple way to amaze your visitors, try creating a salt light. All you need is a big block of salt that you can break into chunks, a translucent bowl, and a light source, and you\u2019re ready to go. Can\u2019t find that type of salt? Some types of beauty soap can do the trick. Of course, you can make a Himalayan salt lamp that looks a little more chic.\nThe reason most Halloween craft ideas sound the same is because people are fixated on the idea that Halloween is supposed to be scary. The truth is you don\u2019t have to plan your decorations around monsters, ghosts, and witches. You can make your life much simpler by creating a theme around autumn colors. You\u2019d be surprised how far you can go even if you\u2019re restricted to shades of yellow, brown, red, and orange.\nSome of the best small condo design ideas for Halloween are so simple that when you read about them you just have to wonder why you didn\u2019t think of them yourself. This is probably one of those ideas. Take a glass container, some water, and some food dye, and mix it to create a magic potion to delight visiting kids. With the right container and the right color dye, you might even be able to make something that you can actually use the whole year round.\nAnother out-of-the-box idea is to use decorations that you\u2019d normally see during other occasions or holidays. For example, we usually see wreaths at Christmas, but with a few tweaks, you can create wreaths that are neither too festive nor too somber. It could take a lot of effort, but it\u2019ll definitely be something with a unique artistic flavor.\nWith the hustle and bustle of life forcing people to spend an increasing proportion of their waking hours at school, in the office, commuting or preparing for one of those three situations, it\u2019s no wonder some homeowners and condo owners aren\u2019t even bothering with their holiday decorations anymore. \u201cWe just take them down again immediately, anyway. What\u2019s the point?\u201d Sure, there\u2019s nothing wrong with seeing things that way. But on the other hand, a creative and positive mindset will let you see that decorating your condo for the Halloween is not a chore, but an opportunity for you to unleash your inner artist.",

This hands-on experience taught me a lot about houses \u2013 how they go together and what goes wrong when they aren\u2019t built properly. My contracting work created a great \u201cfoundation\u201d for performing home inspections!\nIn 2014 I became a home inspector in TX where I worked full-time inspecting ever type of house imaginable. Texas has some of the most stringent requirements for home inspectors in the country including licensing, testing, and very specific reporting under weather conditions much more demanding that those in San Diego.\nI relocated to San Diego in early 2017 with my wife and two small children to be closer to friends and family and to enjoy the beautiful beaches and wonderful weather. After returning to Southern California I found a position at The Real Estate Inspection Company which will utilize all of my past experience. When inspecting for you I commit myself to conducting a thorough investigation of your house and its systems and strive to clearly communicate my findings and their implications. With my years of experience in construction and real estate inspections, I can offer the information and insight that will allow my clients to make an informed decision when buying or selling a home.

    "text": "Just a couple of questions in regard to a planned upgrade. Currently I have a POS GF2MX400 and am in search of a card for about 100-150 Aussie Dollars. I've done a bit of research and have found a few cards drawn to my attention the likes being Radeon 9550, Radeon 9550 Extreme and a few from the 9600 series. I'm steering clear of nVidia for that end of the market as they seem to get blasted by ATI.\nMy current frame of mind is : Get the 9550 for <$100 as it will be 100% better than my current card and have no regrets, spend the rest of the money on something else.\nBut looking at some reviews the 9550 Extreme seems to be pretty sweet aswell. it has a clockspeed of 400/500 up from the 9550 clock speed of 250/400. It has got a few FPS on the stock 9600 in some benches.\nBut it costs an extra $50. Are the internals the same on these cards, would I be able to get the same figures from a stock 9550 with an aftermarket cooler?\nHaven't read much about the 9550, but looking at the specs on the card, it's clearly worse than a 9600, but doesn't cost much less. I can't say anything about the 9550 Extreme, though. In any case, they all support Direct X 9.0 adn have similar speeds, so I don't think you'll be too dissapointed with whatever you choose.\nOn the other hand, it would be worth it to get some more money for something from the Radeon 9700/9800 series. The 9800 Pro is probably the best bang-for-buck card in there, but any of them will be much better than a 9600 or 9550 because they are all 256-bit. The 9600 is basically the top of the low-end range of cards, so \"upgrading\" to one isn't really much of an upgrade.\nMost of those R9550's that are less than $100aus will likely only have 64-bit memory access so stay clear of them and get one that has a full 128-bit memory access.\nSorry but I can't really help you on that subject.\nYawgm0th believe my I would absolutely love to go out and buy a 9800 Pro but I simply can't/won't. I don't have the cash, and even If I did I'd prefer to spend it elsewhere.\nOne more question, how well do nonpro 9600 overclock?\nIf I remember correctly, my Sapphire 9600 non-pro got somewhere around 400/560 in an OEM desktop with no case fans... But again, I might not remember that right.\nBut I wouldn't get too worked up over it. All the overclocking in the world isn't going to make a 9600 play any modern game well. It's okay if you're still into some of the older Quake-3 based games, I guess.\nIt appears to be the same as this, which is 128-bit.",

    "text": "The Haverford School is proud to host the TENTH Annual Checking for Cancer Lacrosse Invitational, featuring premier ranked boys\u2019 lacrosse programs and girls\u2019 lacrosse programs. All of whom will compete in the spirit of the game while promoting the important cause of cancer awareness. Our mission of cancer awareness is particularly personal to our head coach John Nostrant.\nJohn Nostrant, coach of The Haverford School, was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago, and Georgetown Prep coach, Kevin Giblin, is now in remission from his colon cancer. John and Kevin were roommates in college and line mates on the lacrosse field as players. They remain the best of friends. Both highly acclaimed coaches helped coach the United States U-19 Men\u2019s Team to the International World Federation Championship in British Columbia in 2008. Each, however, has had to quietly but courageously endure private ordeals that are all too common to the thousands of individuals who are diagnosed with cancer each year.\nProstate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in American men, other than skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 217,730 new cases of prostate cancer in the United States in 2010. About 32,050 men will die of this disease this year. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. One man in 6 will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and 1 man in 36 will die of this disease. This disease starts in the prostate and if caught before it spreads is highly treatable and curable.\nExcluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimated that about 102,900 new cases of colon cancer (49,470 in men and 51,370 in women) and 39,670 new cases of rectal cancer (22,620 in men and 17,050 in women) were diagnosed in 2010. This is a disease that tends to be slow growing and always starts as a polyp which can be found by colonoscopy. Proper screening should yield an almost perfect cure rate.\nThe good news is that the outlook for individuals diagnosed with prostate and colorectal is better than ever, and the key to a positive prognosis is screening and early detection. Beginning by age 50, men and women who are at average risk for developing colorectal cancer should begin a pattern of routine screening for cancer prevention. We hope that greater awareness will lead to an appreciation of the importance of screening and heightened vigilance in our battle against these curable diseases.",

    "text": "If your dog isn't already on heartworm preventative all year round (and they should be), make sure you get them on preventative NOW!\nHeartworm is transmitted by mosquito bites. The mosquito bites a dog infected with heartworm, then bites your dog and transmits it to them. If you give your dog an effective heartworm preventative within a month of the bite, the heartworm will die.\nIf the dog is not taking an effective preventative (or if you forget to give it), the microscopically small heartworm larvae transmitted by the mosquito will grow up to a worm large enough to easily be seen by the naked eye which lives in the pulmonary artery coming off the heart. If untreated, these worms can cause heart failure and death.\nIf you discover that your dog is positive for heartworm, the treatment is a series of painful injections in the back muscles with a drug containing arsenic. What this does is kill the adult worms, and what you are left with is dead worms in the pulmonary artery. These can also cause death by pulmonary embolism (blood clots to the lungs).\nIt is much better and easier to prevent heartworms than it is to treat them after they have developed to the adult stage.\nHeartworm is common in this area. The local resevoir is the dogs that have the adult form of the disease and the coyote population. Mosquitoes bite these animals then bite your dog, transmitting hearworm larvae.\nCome in now, get your dog tested for heartworm and pick up some heartworm preventative.",

Well, it seems a suggestion for ASC Uttimate.\nDo you do not need to worry about the conflicts or slow down your PC.\nThanks for your feedback. Sorry to tell you that I cannot send more screenshots of IObit Malware Fighter v5, for it has not been released officially. Thanks for your understanding.\nFor this question \" can you add all your scan engines to virustotal, virscan.org, opswat, metascan, herdprotect and jotti malware scan please\" could you please describe the question more clearly? Sorry I did not get you fully.\nI will report it to our product team for consideration.\n@ all, welcome all of your suggestions.\nError Up date engines , bitdefender and iobit !!!\nTo look into the issue, please download the tool from http://testdemo.iobit.com/InfoHelper.exe.\nAfter that, please download and install the full patch from http://update.iobit.com/dl/imf5/bd/b...-201612211.exe to see whether the issue can be solved.\n@all, welcome all your feebacks.

I got to say appearance thus far is AWESOME... Just from the brief look from install, it appears that you all incorporating into it an issue I been feeling I need to address... Browser Protection. I'm hoping I am correct, and you all will address this issue in it, because it does appear I have been getting a lot of Windows corruption, malicious OS issues which appear to be coming in via internet browsers. And since Microsoft itself has started the same in Windows 10, it clearly appears \"the bad guys\" are now focusing in using browsers to attack others, rather than viruses and etc. that current security software focus on. I have yet to see any security suites that focus strongly enough on these browser attacks, therefore I am hoping IObit is \"picking up the sword\" regarding this. Currently, I am on the verge of dropping my once rely upon security suite, and am currently depending on IObit software to pick up the coverage atm, and it seems to be working. So please, keep up the good work.\nThank you for contacting IObit. This is Maggie from IObit.\nHappy to hear that you are satisfied with our products. Your support will be our greatest stimulus to work harder and better. Welcome more your suggestions and feedbacks.\nIf you have any issues, please feel free to tell us.",

    "text": "My blog this week was to be an essay on the similarities between my memoir of my two years teaching English and living in Kazakhstan as an older, married Peace Corps volunteer (At Home on the Kazakh Steppe) and Kathy Pooler\u2019s memoir of living in and escaping from domestic violence, twice (Ever Faithful to His Lead).\nNice young ladies don\u2019t complain.\nNeither of us was willing to risk the relationship we had by speaking our truth, out loud.\nGood girls play nice. They go along.\nThe blog, though, wasn\u2019t coming together. Instead, it rambled, it bogged down, or it was confusing. Still, I forged ahead. I had a deadline to meet. Stiff upper lip.\nWith this last one I stopped, realizing I was in the midst of making that same mistake again.\nWhat I was ignoring \u2014 a trauma I\u2019d experienced only a few days before \u2014 wasn\u2019t going away. And it was affecting my ability to concentrate or attend to what was in front of me, this blog being only the most obvious.\nThe real story for today had to be what was going on for me tonight, as I write this blog on December 8.\nWednesday night, December 3, on our way home from a chorus rehearsal of The Messiah, Woody and I had an accident.\nWe skidded on black ice and totaled our pickup truck. The GMC Sierra rolled over a few times, slid down an embankment, and landed on the driver\u2019s side door.\nI had initially been unaware Woody had lost control. Engrossed in my cell phone as we sped up the highway, my first indication something was amiss was the sudden jarring motion as the car skidded. I saw the road swerve before me as in one of those slow motion scenes in earthquake documentaries. I fully expected him to bring the truck back under control.\n\u201cDon\u2019t overcorrect,\u201d I told him. Twice. I thought it would help.\nThen I watched out my side window as a reflector along the shoulder came racing toward me. I knew we were going over the embankment just beyond it. And I had no idea how steep it was, or how long the fall would last, or what would finally bring the truck to a halt.\nI believed I could be meeting my death. But what I remember most was that in that moment I felt peaceful. It was out of my hands. I had given up trying to fix it; I\u2019d let go of the outcome. There was nothing I could do and I knew it. I was certainly in the moment.\nBut the moment didn\u2019t last long. We rolled over at least twice; I heard glass break; the truck bounced a few times. Then there was silence.\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I asked Woody. \u201cYes. Are you?\u201d he replied. I took a quick assessment.\nThe truck had landed on its left side, on Woody\u2019s driver\u2019s side door. Our seat belts held us securely in our seats, which meant I was suspended a few feet above Woody. Both side windows were blown out and shards of glass plastered my face and neck. Woody also lay on his side, his left arm through the former window and onto the snow beneath him.\nMiraculously, neither of us had any injuries. But we were trapped in the cab and it would take nearly an hour for the rescue squad to cut us out and help us walk away.\nNeither of us panicked. I called 911 from the cell phone that I still clutched in my hand.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in an accident,\u201d I reported to the dispatcher, \u201cRt 91 Northbound.\u201d I gave her our names and told her neither of us was injured, just unable to get out. She wanted our mile marker. Woody told me, \u201cnorth of the Barnet exit.\u201d She still wanted the mile marker.\nI had seen the legs of people walking around above us while I was on the phone. I\u2019ve got this covered, I\u2019d wanted to tell them. Really; there\u2019s no need to stay. I asked them for the mile marker and someone knew it, so I passed it on to the dispatcher. Then I noticed my phone was low on battery so we hung up.\nI hadn\u2019t even thought of that. But it explained the gusts of cold air that Woody was getting from beneath the car.\n\u201cWoody\u2019s shaking. He\u2019s lying in the snow and he\u2019s cold. I want to get him out.\u201d I took off my hat and handed it to him. He\u2019d lost his in the roll.\nSomeone handed us a parka through my open window and I tried to get it over him, but my orientation was off. I\u2019d think I was pushing it up onto his shoulder but I wasn\u2019t even close; it would slide off. Eventually, we figured it out.\nI was glad the people were there. Even if none of them had a phone charger I could use.\nWith the light from the wrecker upon it, our GMC Sierra lies on its side. It served us well.\nThe state trooper was the first to arrive, delayed by the icy roads, he said. He bent low and peered into the cab through my husband\u2019s missing window.\n\u201cPut your car in park and give me the keys,\u201d he said to Woody after asking us about injuries.\nThe rescue squad came next; they\u2019d all been at home, warm and comfortable before we slid off the road. The EMS crew was the final set to join; they wanted to know our medical history. Really. While I dangled midair in my seat belt, the only medical condition I could think of concerned my overactive bladder.\nAfter much analysis and discussion, the rescue crew cut the roof off the cab. This involved covering us with blankets so the glass from the front and rear windows that they needed to shatter first would not get in our faces. With the roof laid out on the snow, they guided us as we walked over it and up to the EMS van.\nOur vitals were taken. My blood pressure was twenty points higher than normal, Woody\u2019s was forty. The crew said they weren\u2019t concerned by that, but I noticed they took Woody\u2019s again after a few minutes; it had come down 20 points.\nWe chose not to go to the hospital and signed the necessary papers. Then, we waited in the trooper\u2019s car for the wrecker that had to come.\nOur entourage had left and I watched from the front passenger seat as the trooper combed the hillside collecting the bags of stones we had had in the truck for winter ballast against the weight of the snow plow (at home in the barn on this night).\nAfter the trooper drove us home, Woody and I spent considerable time making sure we found all the remaining shards of glass. Really. My right ear was packed with glass but I had only a small puncture wound on my right pinky finger. Woody had his single puncture wound on his left ring finger. We felt immeasurably grateful and slept very well that night.\nFor the next day and a half I believed that we\u2019d escaped unscathed. I posted to one of my closed FB groups, We Love Memoirs, and got all the necessary support and sympathy I expected and wanted. We sang in the first concert of The Messiah that Friday night and talked with the folks from the two cars who had stopped. It had been traumatic for them as well.\nSaturday morning we drove into town to see the truck and collect those odds and ends that we wanted to hang onto.\nThat afternoon I had a massage, then went food shopping, planning to get home in time to have a light supper and dress for the second of the three concerts that weekend. But as I shopped I got angrier and angrier. When I overheard a conversation between the two store employees and a policeman about a shopper, I complained.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a topic to be discussing where it can be overheard by a customer,\u201d I told them in anger. They shrugged, but they stopped talking (though one of the managers rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath at me).\nAs I drove home I realized that the effects of the trauma I\u2019d had just a few days before were beginning to show.\n\u201cI\u2019m staying home,\u201d I told Woody when I got home. \u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere tonight.\u201d I just wanted to stop moving.\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he responded in an equally defiant tone. I ignored him. Eventually, as the reality sunk in, he admitted he\u2019d also considered staying home. He just didn\u2019t want to.\nI took a bubble bath; he watched Netflix. Sunday we felt well enough, even eager, to sing in the final concert, an afternoon event. I was glad we did.\nOn Monday night, telling my hospice choir friends about it, I began to cry. I had no idea I was still so raw.\nWhen I didn\u2019t think about it, I\u2019d carry on as though nothing was amiss. When I thought about it, I\u2019d break down.\nWhen I didn\u2019t think about it, I\u2019d snap at Woody and hear Woody snap back at me. When I thought about it, I\u2019d cry.\nI have a hard time concentrating. My mind is scattered. I can\u2019t settle into a routine. Writing this blog, as you now know, has been difficult.\nCognitively, I know that I am grateful we were not seriously injured. But I don\u2019t FEEL grateful. I feel outrage, fury. I want to hit something. I want to yell, to scream really. But I do neither. Instead, I write. I posted tonight to another closed FB group I\u2019m on and am eager to hear from them. I talk on the phone to friends. I walk in the woods (on snow shoes). I take bubble baths.\nThe anger comes in spurts. Unexpected spurts. And as quickly as it surfaces, it evaporates.\nI\u2019m drinking lots of tea. I\u2019m doing all the things I should be doing. I\u2019m also playing computer solitaire like a junkie.\nWoody and I stopped talking about it. What more can we say?\nDon\u2019t just do something; sit there.\nAnd that is exactly what I will do.\nI will allow myself time to wind my way through the many layers that have formed.\nAnd, later, after we know what the insurance company will allow, I will help Woody find himself a new truck.\nTime changes the needs of people.\nIt had a picture of an hour glass and a long, winding road in the background. I haven\u2019t thought of it in years. With time, I feel myself back in my own skin once again. But I\u2019m different too.\nFrom the policeman at the food store talking out of turn, to my mother last week saying something I thought insensitive, to a woman in my recent writer\u2019s group this week interrupting someone I wanted to hear, my reactions are different than they would have been just a few weeks ago. I\u2019m speaking out, standing up, letting my reality be known.\nWhether its because I realize my time on this earth really is limited (and precious) or something else, I don\u2019t even try to know.\nWhat I do know is that I felt peaceful at the moment I thought I was facing my death. And that is a gift.\nAs is our ability to replace our Sierra with a shiny new toy.\nIn 2000, my husband and I had a car accident and was lucky to be alive. It changed the both of us. Our whole outlook on life has changed since then. We appreciate each other more but I also use that for my decision making. When I don\u2019t want to do something, I ask myself \u2013 If the one I loved died tomorrow, would I have regrets? If the answer is no, I don\u2019t do it. If the answer is yes, I grin and bear it while I do it. Many of the little things that used to irritate me don\u2019t any more because in the grand scheme of things \u2013 who really cares? I fight the fights that are important to me even if I feel it is a losing battle because it feels right to me. My sense of what is important has changed. Now we do a lot of traveling and meeting new friends. Life is too short so I need to get busy enjoying it! I\u2019m so glad y\u2019all are okay! Give yourself time for everything to make sense again.\nHi Pat. Yes, time. That is the great healer. Thanks for stopping and adding your thoughts. Btw, I\u2019m going to send your website address to my colleagues in Kazakhstan; you can offer them an interesting new perspective on teaching.\nI take walks along the beach and sing to the top of my lungs. A great release allowing fresh thoughts and ideas.\nWhy do you think you feel angry?\nHi Susan, I thought of you when I read the news recently of the contingent going to Uraguay. I need to learn more of your adopted land. In my mind I lump it in with Paraguay, something akin to American lumping all the Stans together.\nAs for the why, I can only say that I\u2019m more focused on feeling the anger, on experiencing it, \u201chonoring\u201d it if you will. If I start to analyze it, I find myself going into my head and then I don\u2019t feel it so much anymore. It really doesn\u2019t matter to me so much, but honoring it, getting it out does. And, as I write these words, I have to say I\u2019m not feeling it at the moment. As I wrote below, sometimes one trauma can raise old traumas never fully healed, so that\u2019s a possibility.\nOh, Janet, your post took my breath away. I am so glad you and Woody were not physically injured. Trauma like that is not easy to just set aside to go away on its own. It will be with you for a while. Speaking and writing about it is the best medicine for now. Do not ignore it.\nI pray your holidays will be filled with healing and peace.\nYes Joan, that\u2019s another gift I have, that I can write about it and I have people in my life who (seem to) never tire of hearing the tale. Telling our stories of trauma, at all levels, is healing. That and hot baths (though someone on facebook did warn that too hot baths seem to be related to stroke, particularly after a physical trauma, so they are no longer so hot). And I also know that each tragedy or loss reignites those that may still lie unresolved, so I\u2019ve got much to chew on since this happened. Thanks for your support.\nOh Janet, thank God you and Woody survived such a frightening ordeal. It\u2019s amazing how near-death experiences wake us up to what really matters. When I was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease in 1996, my life came to a complete halt but in that halt, I learned a very important lesson\u2013life is short and don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Enjoy the moments and yes. don\u2019t just do something , sit there.\u201d The rawness of your writing brings me right there with you and makes me even more grateful you are around to pick out that bright red truck! BTW, thank you for your thoughts about the similarities of our stories. At the time, they were ,of course, our life crises. But isn\u2019t it grand to be able to look back and realize they were a detour that led to who we are today. Alive and well and very, very grateful. Sending healing hugs your way.\nHi Kathy I love that image of life coming to a halt, and in that halt seeing things more clearly. I shall accept your hugs and return them in full.\nJudging from the previous comments, your readers can relate to the accident you\u2019ve recently experienced. I know I can. Writing/illustrating your feelings will help you continue to process the trauma. I experienced something similar back in college when the car I was a passenger in flipped over on a snowy road \u2013 all in slow motion as you describe. No one wore seat-belts, so 6 bodies flew all over the place. I ended up with a bloody knee but did go to the hospital to get checked out.\nThen, over ten years ago I was rear-ended by a fast moving vehicle which totaled my sturdy car, an Infiniti. Half of the car looked like an accordion. In the moment of crisis, common sense left me, and I handed a complete stranger my wallet so I could us his cellphone. Dumb \u2013 though he did hand it back. Like you, thoughts and actions registered as non sequitur.\nAfter such dramatic events, we have to believe we live in an altered state at least for awhile, probably suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome, which may explain your anger. I like your recipe for healing, don\u2019t just do something; sit there.\nI hope it\u2019s in front of a blazing fire with some hot chocolate. Blessings and healing to you and your family this Christmas season.\nHi Marian, Well, I can report that we had our woodstove moved upstairs this summer and it\u2019s now ablaze about two feet from me here on the DR table. I find I prefer to write downstairs lately, not upstairs in my little corner of the world. Alas, the hot chocolate is tea, but there is more honey in it than usual. One more concession to where I am at the moment. Thanks for writing. As always.\nGlad you and Woody are okay. That was quite an ordeal and it sounds life-changing. I think that is what transformation does. We are never the same. I am going through something similar as I continue to heal from an illness that has dogged my life for nearly four decades. I hear and understand your anger.\nFor me, adjusting to a new life that is one of health rather than chronic illness has been incredibly difficult. Letting go of life as I knew it\u2013one fraught with illness\u2013has meant changing, completely, how I live including my routine. Only now, am I stepping into my \u201cnew shoes,\u201d as it were. A recent watershed moment revealed that transformation requires letting go of what one was for what one is now.\nThis post is so beautifully and achingly written, Janet. Thank you.\nThank you, Karen. And welcome. Your words are always a balm to me. I\u2019ve been following your story through your blog posts and, with your comment here, I\u2019m really struck by how easy it is for me to fall into that judgment trap. ( e.g., New found health after years of illess is Good. Traumatic auto accident is Bad.) And once again I\u2019m reminded how limiting these judgments can be. Both situations involve change, a change in a sense of who we are, our identity of you will. And both require time and gentleness. I send you a warm virtual bear hug over the miles.",

Janet notifies the Metadata Librarian (in this case, Shawn) to process them.\nC. Shawn then runs the PERL script \"processEtds\" which is located in her scripts directory. This script will ask which directory to process, and whether the files are for May, December, or September graduation, so it knows when to start the embargoes. It will create a subdirectory in the \"working\" directory which matches the name of the selected directory. Within this it will create 3 subdirectories: OPEN, PRQ, and CONTENT. OPEN is where it will open the zip directories. PRQ is where it will put the renamed and altered XML for processing. CONTENT is where it will put the renamed content files.\nD. Shawn works with the deposited content to create valid MODS files meeting our local profile, which include the assigned identifier and PURL, and are named for the assigned identifier with a \".mods.xml\" extension.\nE. Shawn also creates valid MARC files for upload into our OPAC system, which reference the included assigned identifier and PURL.\nF. She uploads the finished MODS and the associated renamed content into a datestamp-titled MODS directory in her home area on libcontent1.lib.ua.edu.\nG.

    "text": "Jan 9, 2006 | 00:02 1 I noticed in the other thread a discussion developed about keeping the Sabbath.\nScripture says Yahshua became our Sabbath. It's not just one day of the week we should rest in Him, but every day.\nHebrews 4:4-11, \"For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. There remaineth therefore a rest (sabbatismos) to the people of God. <b>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</b> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.\"\nYour post triggers some questions.\n1 Is Yeshua out to lunch in Matt 5:17-20 when He proclaims that the instructions and the prophets will not disappear until heaven and earth disappear?\n2 Since the Sabbath commandment is part of the ten, are the other 9 also void?\n3 Is Isa 66:22-24 talking about something other than the new heaven and new earth that belivers have a hope to inhabit?\n4 Why is a beliver in such a notion working at all? Hebr 4:9-10. Since such a believer has entered in to the Sabbath rest of Yeshua, he/she should not work ever,right?\n5 Since the is no special day for Sabbath, why do most christians celebrate a day of rest on the day of sun worship that the catholic church adopted in favour of the Sabbath that Yeshua followers kept?\nI hope this can lead to a good discussion based on scripture.\nThe Law has definitely not been changed.\nExodus 20:8-9, \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all <u>thy</u> work:\"\nHebrews 4:10, \"For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.\"\nI believe this is talking about the millenium age, the thousand year rule by Yahshua.\nCommon sense would tell one that working for the Lord would include seeing to one's bodily needs so one could continue to work for the Lord.\nIn effect, seeing to one's bodily needs would then be the Lord's work.\nI could only attribute it to Biblical illiteracy.\nThanks for not slinging mud!!\nYeshua became the living Torah. How can Yeshua be other than according to Torah? And my question is very logical. If we can change one commandment, why not change all? The 4th commandment is the longest, most detailed commandment.\nInterestingly we divide our year according to the earths travel one turn around the sun and the day according to the earth spinning one revolution, but organising the days into seven and calling them weeks have no natural connection. Months can be tied to the moon phases and is scriptural since the first instruction was to celebrate new moon. Sun worshippers are idolaters.\nThe only reason for a seven day week is Gods word!\nSince the Sabbath is a commandment and since God wants us to keep the seventh day holy. Since the Sabbath has been kept until Yeshua came and since Yeshua kept the Sabbath and since all the disciples kept the Sabbath. Since the Sabbath was changed by humansto sun-day. And since we obviously are to keep the Sabbath in the millenium, is it possible maybe that Hebrews talks about how people, gentiles and israelites alike can enter in to Gods rest by faith. Is it possible that Hebrews 4 talks about how Israels people were disobedient and had a hard time to enter Canan?\nVerse 9:There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; 10for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.\nThe only thing preventing us to enter that rest is disobedience, verse 11 Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.\nCommon sense have gotten lots of believers in trouble.\nVerse 12:For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.\nThis is, again, Not NT ( since it was not written yet) that is referred to but it is Tanak and Torah especially.\nYeshau says that the law stands in Matt 5.\nEven to the Gentiles that it talks about in Acts 15, that had a hard time to learn and follow the law it was decided by the whole council what James said: That they should start with these 4 things:1 abstain from food polluted by idols 2 abstain from sexual immorality 3 abstain from meat from strangled animals and 4 not eat blood. Verse 21:For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.\" This is where they should learn: on Sabbath, in the synagogue, learning from Moshe.\nHas God really changed His Holy day-the Sabbath? The day we are to honour and keep in remembrance YHVH, Adonai, Hashem??Abraham, Isaacs and Jacobs God!\nAnother topic. Do you know that the catholic church has changed the ten commandments and also the name of God?\nYou've answered your own question. Yahshua became God's Word in the flesh. He became the Sabbath.\nSabbath means \"rest\". We find our rest in Him every day, not just one day of the week.\nActually, Numbers 10:10 refers to the beginning of the month, not new moon. <i>chodesh</i> means \"month\", or \"monthly\". Nothing to do with the moon.\nFurther, you will find prophecies concerning the \"children of darkness\" are <b>always</b> given in moons. While prophecies concerning the \"children of light\" are <b>always</b> given in days.\n1 Thessalonians 5:5, \"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\"\nYahshua didn't keep the Sabbath in the way you are seeming to imply. He did work on the Sabbath. He healed and picked corn on the Sabbath. But it wasn't His work, it was the Father's work.\nI won't be commenting on any particular denomination. Discussing God's Word is more than sufficient for me.\nThank you for acknowledging Yeshua being the living word of God-Torah. Part of Torah is Exodus 20:8-11 (the fourth commandment)8Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\nThe rest we have in Yeshua is compared to when Israels people were led out of captivity and entered Caanan. Compare chapter 3 and 4 and read the whole thing in context.I.e ch 3 v7-11. It is a warning against unbelief.ch 4 v 2 talks about believers and non-believers.\nSee he says\"if they shall enter into my rest\". It is a choice and we all know that salvation is by faith in Yeshua so that nobody can boast. Also he states \"although the works were finished from the foundation of the world\". Since the work was finished from the foundation of the world would indicate that nothing after the foundation of the world would change the works, right?\n\"For generations to come\" means until there are no more generations.\nWho are the children of Israel? Eph 3:4-6; In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. 6This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.\nIsraels people or Gods household are those who believe that Yeshua is who He said He is, and accept Him as Lord .\n2320 chodesh from 'chadash' (2318); the new moon; by implication, a month:--month(-ly), new moon.\na primitive root; to be new; causatively, to rebuild:--renew, repair.\nThis is what MS Encarta has to say about month.\nIt has all to do with the moon!\nAs I referred to before in Isaiah 66 it talks about BOTH Sabbaths and New moons to be kept once the new heaven and the new earth is established. It is established in verse 23 \"from one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another\"that the days are not running together consecutive but rather are distinguished from one to another with space in between(28 days and six days).\nCan you explain more in detail where in the Bible you find the connection between the moon and the children of darkness?\nVery interesting comment that Yeshua worked on the Sabbath. IF He did He would have committed a sin under the old covenant and thereby He would not have been sin free.\nYeshua did not commit any sin, He was totally and utterly sinfree, so I want to ask you sincerely if you, sir, are implying that Yeshua committed sin?\nI would also strongly suggest that none of the disciples broke the Sabbath either!\nSo whatever actions Yeshua and His disciples did during Sabbath were kosher according to Moshe.\nRemember that the religious leaders of that time had implemented many \"fence-laws\" by themselves for which they were called broad of vipers and white washed toombs.\nto repose, i.e to desist from exertion. This fits perfectly with the description God had about to rest the seventh day from work.Day 1-6 exert yourselves, day 7 desist from exertion.\nSo anybody that proclaims to celebrate an everyday rest should desist from exertion everyday. That sounds like common sense and logic, doesn't it?\nFunny how by not mentioning you actually mention!!\nMost denominations are demon-nations full of man made religious \"laws\" and gospels of pastor so and so.\nGods word sets free and is the truth.\nIt is the manual that has been issued by the manufacturer.\nI didn't mean to offend you and if I did I appologize.\nI have to speak what is on my mind.\nIf I am out to lunch, set me straight.",

    "text": "In previous seasons, K-State developed an effective scouting routine leading up to its NCAA Tournament opener. Video and other information on an opponent began flowing.\nBut the Wildcats will prepare differently this time. On top of adjusting to the approach of a new coaching staff, they will have to spend the next two days planning for multiple opponents before locking in on either La Salle or Boise State on Thursday in Kansas City.\nScouting for two teams instead of one will be a challenge. Coaches will come up with two game plans, and the staff will provide players with twice as much video. To help ease the process, Bruce Weber said four coaches will help gather information instead of the usual three.\nSome will argue preparing for multiple opponents puts K-State at a disadvantage compared to other highly seeded teams. Three other teams in the field of 68 have to deal with the same time crunch and challenge of facing a team that has already won a game in the tournament.\nBoise State averages more than 73 points behind Anthony Drmic (17.3 points) and Derrick Marks (16.3). The Broncos won nine games in the Mountain West Conference \u2014 which this season has college basketball\u2019s top conference RPI \u2014 and beat Creighton on the road. They are not easy to prepare for.\nNeither is La Salle, which won 11 games in the Atlantic 10 behind dynamic guards Ramon Galloway and Tyreek Duren. The Explorers beat Butler and VCU this season.\nOf course, others will say it is an advantage. Sure, K-State doesn\u2019t know who it will play on Friday, but La Salle and Boise State aren\u2019t even thinking about the Wildcats yet.\nA live game, especially in the NCAA Tournament, can often reveal more about a team than what can be found from replays of regular-season games.\nKansas State\u2019s basketball game against current No. 1 Gonzaga next season at Intrust Bank Arena in Wichita will be Dec. 21, the schools announced Monday. It\u2019s a return trip to Kansas after Gonzaga\u2019s victory in a neutral-court game in Seattle this season.\nK-State season-ticket holders and Ahearn Fund members will have first opportunities to purchase tickets, with a public sale beginning at 10 a.m. Sept. 13 through selectaseat.com or by calling 855-755-7328. Tickets will range between $12 and $200, and K-State students can purchase $10 student tickets in the fall.",

    "text": "A Novel in a month?!\nIn the month of November, I posted a picture on my Instagram and my Facebook, with a super excited face, about being part of some strange thing called Nanowrimo. I figured it was time for an update and give a little explanation about my Nanowrimo experience.\nI heard about Nanowrimo sometime in 2015 but I didn\u2019t feel I was ready to take on such a daunting task at that point in my life. When it came to writing that amount of words, (50k to be exact), it made me cower in the dark corner of my brain. Since, I\u2019ve heard about it, I\u2019ve been working on trying to write something everyday. Not for Nanowrimo, just for disciplining myself as a writer in general. It sounds much easier than it is in reality (for me at least). With the general discipline almost in tact, I felt I was not only ready but capable of accomplishing this challenge this time around.\nI signed up, looked around the website, (www.nanowrimo.org) and took my time trying to get acquainted with it. The first task the page asks is for you to sign up and make a profile. Easy peasey, Unbecoming Jayne is already my thing. But, then I needed a name and some information about my novel that wasn\u2019t even written yet. I had to log off for a couple days to think about that. I came up with a name and then a couple days later a one sentence summary on what I had planned on writing. (If you write, you may notice your plans don\u2019t always workout, so, it was just a filler at that point) I also created a picture on my phone to be my temporary book cover. So my profile was set. I had a little plan, (when I say plan it\u2019s Saschia\u2019s idea of a plan which is more like a fantastical idea in my head that is usually completely unrealistic). Ok, so, I feel like a newb, but, I feel like I have it all in order and I begin to search the site a little more in depth. I find the site has options for setting and recording goals, writing buddies, forums, and writing meetups. Like, other writers would come out of their magical creative places, write together, and talk about life! Growing up going to three different youth groups a week, this was like my adult writing version of that. They were great and I got to meet with other writers who struggle with the same writing problems I do. They are fun \u201cnormal\u201d people from all over Ct. (I think there\u2019s a stigma that writers look abnormal lol but that might just be me and my fantastical imagination.) My group even had a super awesome leader or in Nano language Municipal Liaison who planned write-ins around Connecticut\u2019s coastline. She brought super awesome prizes and was uplifting and understanding when it came to writing. She was also knowledgeable and wrote along side us. I think writing groups are a fabulous idea. I don\u2019t know if there are tons of them already and I just don\u2019t know where to look but, they\u2019re great.\nHow\u2019d I do, you ask? Did I finish my 50k word novel in a month? No, I didn\u2019t. Yes, I was pretty disappointed about it. I said I was shelfing my book. One time I even yelled at the peaceful dinner table that I wanted to burn it in the back yard. It was a random outburst and it made everyone at the table uncomfortable. So, I threw a smile in at the end. I think it helped. On the great side of all this, after stewing over losing the game, I have 30k words written and a great rough draft to work from! It can be expanded on and turned into so many different things. Plus, after printing out 60 pages of my rough draft to read over and mark up, I was floored. I was literally watching each page print from the printer. That was my consequential pat on the back.\nSo with all that, yes, I plan to keep doing Nanwrimo every year. I think it is a great community for writers. And yes I have a novel in the works and Yes, I think you all should sign up for it and plan to do it with me next year. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ll post the link here again you know, just in case you decide to click it and signup so all the libraries in New London county create a huge section in the library that is dedicated to only locally written novels. Remember most of the great writers come from New England. lol Might as well prove it.",

    "text": "The Deer Creek Trail is, without a doubt, not the best trail in Maryland. It\u2019s probably not even the best in Susquehanna State Park. But there is at least something soothing about the surroundings on this largely wooded loop hike, situated just off the Susquehanna River in northeast Maryland. Here lofty trees, many devoid of branches, rise like sentinels above the damp, cool earth. The tranquil Susquehanna, though not visible, sets the stage for an abundance of bird and animal life, while the trail\u2019s namesake creek carves steep hillsides, funneling rain water into the rushing stream. Amid the serene landscape is a surprising, hidden gem: an award-winning American beech tree, a woody behemoth with thick tentacles that is sure to foster the imagination.\nSusquehanna State Park is relatively convenient for passersby on Interstate 95, situated about halfway between Baltimore, Maryland and Wilmington, Delaware. (Note: Take Exit 89 to Havre de Grace/Churchville.) A number of country roads converge on the park, but it is Rock Run Road that cuts through the heart of the preserve, weaving through open fields before plunging into a sea of trees, darkened by the thick canopy. At the banks of the Susquehanna\u2014and the end of Rock Run Road\u2014turn left onto Stafford Road and continue northwest for 1.5 miles. Take a left again at the entrance to the Deer Creek Picnic Area; this is only one of many possible starting points for the Deer Creek Trail loop, but it is probably the most easily accessible.\nAt around the hike\u2019s highest point, the trail forks again, with a short spur heading right to the base of a gargantuan white oak tree, while the main path\u2014now a narrow single-track\u2014continues straight. From here, the trail tracks downhill into a ravine that feeds the Elbow Branch of Deer Creek. Stay right at the two forks\u2014a pair of faint spurs provide access to the campground at 0.77 miles and 0.81 miles.\nCutting sharply right, the trail descends in force, eventually crossing a small wooden bridge at 9/10 miles. What goes down must come up, and the Deer Creek Trail from here begins a sequence in which it climbs in and out of several small gullies. By 1.2 miles, the path has almost doubled back on itself, but then quickly cuts northwest and begins its sharpest descent yet.\nAround 1.25 miles from the start, the Deer Creek Trail flanks its main attraction on the left: the award-winning American beech tree. This hulking mass was a \u201cMaryland Big Tree Champion,\u201d meaning it was\u2014at one point\u2014the largest recorded tree of its species. Alas, it appears the beech has been bested in recent years, as other records list four other American beeches in Maryland as larger. In any case, the massive tree, which boasts dozens of robust branches, is an impressive sight.\nBeyond the beech, the Deer Creek Trail continues on its sharp declivity, finally abating at around 1.4 miles. Here the path rounds a right-hand bend and passes a spur that leads down to the Deer Creek Pumping Station, visible downhill to the left. It is around this point that the trail\u2019s namesake stream also comes into view\u2014though at a distance and obscured by the tree cover.\nHeading northeast, the trail drops to clear a ravine then begins a steady climb, reaching nearly the top of a woody knoll before it descends again. Look for the remains of a short rock wall on the left at around 1.8 miles, a testament to the early settlers of the Susquehanna River area. At two miles, the path forks again (stay right), marking the start of the homestretch. Continue \u00bc mile\u2014staying right again at the next fork\u2014to continue to the end of the circuit, arriving at the original four-way junction after about an hour to 1 \u00bd hours of hiking. Bear left and return to the parking lot.\nThis entry was posted in Maryland, Susquehanna State Park and tagged beech, Deer Creek, Deer Creek Trail, loop hike, Maryland, Susquehanna State Park.

    "text": "Change-Able Operations or \"Could DevOps Save Spiderman?\"\nHave you heard about the New York City broadway show Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark? It should have been a big success. The music was written by Bono and the Edge from U2. It was directed by Julie Taymor, who had previously created many successful shows including The Lion King. Sadly, before it opened, the show was already making headlines due to six actors getting seriously injured and other issues.\nThe show opened late, but it did finally open. It ran from June 2011 to January 2014.\nWhen the show closed Taymor said that one of the biggest problems with bringing the show to production was that they were using new technology that was difficult to work with. Many of the scenes involved choreography that was highly dependent on pre-programmed robotics. Any changes that involved the robotics required a 5 hour wait.\nNormally directors and choreographers can attempt dozens of changes in a day of rehearsal to get a scene or dance number \"just right.\" Imagine finding yourself in a situation where you can only attempt a new change once or twice a day.\nThe ability to confidently make changes at will is key to being able to innovate. Innovation means trying new things and keeping what works, throwing away what doesn't. If you can't make changes, then you can't innovate.\nConsider the opposite of innovation. We've all been at a company that resists change or has calcified to the point where they are unable to make change. Nothing can get better if you can't change policies, procedures, or technology. Since entropy means things slowly get worse over time, an organization that is unable to change, by definition, is an organization that is spiraling towards doom.\nI'm reminded of this recently due to the Heartbleed security issue. Like most system administrators, the Heartbleed bug meant I had to spend a lot of time upgrading the software and firmware of nearly every system in their organization. For many of us it meant discovering systems that hadn't been upgraded in so long that the implications were unknown. As sysadmins we wanted to protect ourselves against this security flaw, but we also had to face our own fear of change.\nWe need to create a world where we are able to change, or \"change-able\".\nThere are many factors that enable us to be \"change-able\". One factor is frequency: we can make change, one after the next, in rapid succession.\nSoftware upgrades: Every 1-3 years there is a new Microsoft Windows operating system and upgrading requires much care and planning. Systems are wiped and reloaded because we are often re-inventing the world from scratch with each upgrade. On the other hand, software that is upgraded frequently requires less testing each time because the change is less of a \"quantum leap\". In addition, we get better at the process because we do it often. We automate the testing, the upgrade process itself, we design systems that are field-upgradable or hot-upgradable because we have to... otherwise these frequent upgrades would be impossible.\nProcedures: Someone recently told me he doesn't document his process for doing something because it only happens once a year and by then the process has changed. Since he has to reinvent the procedure each time the best he can do is keep notes about how the process worked last time. Contrast this to a procedure that is done weekly or daily. You can probably document it well enough that, barring major changes, you can delegate the process to a more junior person.\nSoftware releases: If you collaborate with developers who put out releases infrequently, each release contains thousands of changes. A bug could be in any of those changes. Continuous Delivery systems compile and test the software after every source code change. Any new bugs discovered are likely to be found in the very small change that was recently checked in.\nAnother factor in being \"change-able\" is the how difficult it is to make a change.\nI've been at companies where making a DNS change required editing 5 different files on two different systems, manually running a series of tests and then saying a prayer. I've been at others where one typed a command to insert to delete the record, and the rest just happened for me.\nWhen it is difficult to make a change, we make them less often. We are tempted to avoid any action that requires that kind of change. This has a domino effect that slows and delays other projects. Or, it means we make the decision to live with a bad situation rather than fix it. You settle for less.\nWhen we make changes less frequently, we get worse at doing them. Therefore they become more risky to do. Because they are more risky, we do them even less. It becomes a downward spiral.\nDevOps is, if anything, about making operations more \"change-able\". Everyone has their own definition of DevOps, but what they all have in common is that DevOps makes operations better able to change: change more frequently and change more easily. The result is confidence in our ability to make changes. In that way, confidence is a precondition to being able to innovate.\nWhich brings us back to Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark. How much innovation could really happen if each change took 5 hours? Imagine paying a hundred dancers, actors, and technicians to do nothing for 5 hours waiting for the next iteration. You can't send them home. You can't tell them \"come in for a few minutes every 5 hours\". You would, instead, avoid change and settle for less. You would settle for what you have instead of fixing the problems.",

    "text": "This is an exciting post to write. Just look at these images! Aren\u2019t they beautiful? As soon as I saw these images I knew I had to share them with you. They were styled by blogging friends Kate Watson-Smyth and Pippa Jameson along with interior designer, stylist and TV personality Sophie Robinson. These super talented ladies were asked to style these roomsets for DFS, the biggest sofa manufacturer in the UK. DFS has recently conducted some research into how British people feel about colourful homes. The findings make for interesting reading.\nThe research shows that neutrals remain the UK\u2019s top colour choice, as 39% of UK homeowners opt for grey, cream, beige or magnolia as the main colour theme in their home. However, the findings also show that many of us (46%) would actually like to embrace a bolder palette and live in more colourful homes. Roughly the same percentage of people (47%) are afraid of using colour in case they get it wrong. This sad statistic shows to what extent our colour aspirations are being hampered by a crippling self-doubt.\nOf those surveyed, 27% said that they lack any inspiration at all when it comes to bringing colour into their home. A further 20% said they look to the homes of their friends and family when choosing colours.\nA further 20% said they would like to use blush pink at home, 27% said sage green and 29% said teal. However, these were also some of the colours that homeowners feel least confident bringing into their homes.\nIt\u2019s not all negative though as sales data from DFS shows that, as a nation, we are starting to conquer our fear of colour and create more colourful homes. Sales of pink sofas have increased by 16% in 2018 compared to the same period last year (January-April\u201917). Green sofas have seen a 9% increase. And sales of yellow sofas at DFS have more than doubled year on year (January-April \u201917 to January-April \u201918).\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a neutral colour palette, it can be the basis of a beautiful home, but we also know that so many people are hiding their love for colour behind a fear of failure. Colour can have such a positive impact on how we feel in the sanctuary of our homes, whether that\u2019s a colourful couch or accent chair, or a more neutral sofa in a colourful room.\nBringing colour into the home shouldn\u2019t be something people are fearful of. It\u2019s simply about recognising the colours you love, and forgetting any fears of getting it wrong. While our friends and family are often the ones we turn to for inspiration, we also want to help people find the colour confidence they\u2019re longing to unleash. Our new colour hub has a host of inspiration for how to use and combine colours to realise a palette that can make you smile.\nIn their mission to help Britain be more fearless when it comes to colour, DFS has launched a Colour Hub which offers inspiration and advice on achievable ways to create more colourful homes.\nFor years I shunned colour too and lived in a magnolia home. Once I painted that first room though there was no looking back and my colour confidence has continued to grow. I\u2019m now feeling super inspired by Sophie\u2019s bright and bold living room. It\u2019s crazy but I love it!\nI\u2019d also love to get some feedback from you guys. Have you embraced colour at home or are you too scared of getting it wrong? If you could find the courage to go bold, what colour would you choose? Let me know in the comments.\nReally interesting statistics and I love the styling in the photographs! My first home was fairly neutral, the second was colourful, and now I\u2019ve gone back to neutral. For me, it depends on the property and what will work best.\nI wish I could have experienced these beautiful roomsets in the flesh. They look lovely!\nLovely colorful decors. The pictures are gorgeous and inspirational!",

    "text": "Given how far away we still are from personal spacecraft, perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that most design concepts for extra-terrestrial ships haven\u2019t evolved much in the last couple decades. Concerned more with practicalities (and budget constraints) than aesthetics, even NASA has stuck to the same-old same-old when it comes to spacecraft design, but a fun vision of the future from Ferrari\u2019s design director gives us some hope.\nKnown for incorporating Ferrari design sensibilities into all sorts of sketches, Flavio Manzoni doesn\u2019t disappoint with his spaceship concept. Fluid and reflective, the ship is just as sleek as any of the real-life luxury cars that Manzoni has designed, including the LaFerrari supercar.\nThe ship is divided into two shells by a signature red line, and two wings wrap around the lower section of the body.\nUnveiling the sketches and renderings at Form Trends, Manzoni says it started as just a bit of fun, inspired by his childhood living at the top of a six-story building and imagining a UFO landing on the rooftop terrace.",

Seems like Periscope is having a bit of an issue right now that\u2019s not letting anyone stream. Sucky timing, for sure.\nWe\u2019re seeing unusually heavy service loads and working on stabilizing the service. Apologies for the inconvenience!\nTwitter was using Periscope to show backstage footage before CEO Jack Dorsey took the stage and perhaps that rocked the house so much it went down. To be fair, it was a 2 hour keynote (that might have gone a bit long, not sure) and if anyone was trying to stream all of it they should learn what livestreaming is all about.\nIt\u2019s been down for well over 50 minutes and we\u2019ll update you when we hear more. Luckily there\u2019s a lot of developers around today at the conference, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get everything going again.\nJust picture my Periscope from the end of the keynote being ridiculously awesome.

Students are paired with mentors from Dell EMC Glasgow, who provide them with 1-1 support and guidance to help bridge the gap between education and employment.\nSkills Development Scotland, The Herald, Netball Scotland, the Scottish Government and the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce joined us at the Glasgow office to celebrate the launch of the program. Key speakers MSP Ivan McKee, Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation, and Gail Duff from Scottish Enterprise, expressed their support for the prograe and Dell EMC\u2019s efforts to tackle the gender skills gap.\nFacilitators from the University of Strathclyde, took the mentees on a colorful journey using an inspiring method called LEGO Serious Play which fosters creative thinking using LEGO\u00ae bricks. One of the students described the day as being a \u201cwonderful way to meet new people who share similar experiences\u201d.\nEach of the students expressed who they were as individuals through their LEGO duck, by explaining how each component relates to their personal attributes. The students were then asked to build a model, which represents their aspirations and what STEMAspire means to them.\nThe facilitators also gifted the girls with a LEGO\u00ae STEMAspire mascot Rosemary.\nMentees from the previous year underwent a graduation ceremony, where they received a trophy and a certificate for completing the STEMAspire program.\n\u201cIt was a pleasure to have worked with Anna and watch her confidence grow through the year and I am delighted she realized her aspiration to study at Glasgow University, after having worked so hard to meet the grade requirements and putting it top of the list on that UCAS form.\u201d \u2013 Mark White.\n\u201cUWS students studying Creative Computing, Applied Computing, Engineering and Physical Sciences subjects have benefited greatly from DELL\u2019s STEM Aspire Mentoring Program.

    "text": "Sooo. I was just thinking of whether or not Wotb needs innovative ways to liven up things. So here is what I came up with.\n-1 tank gets more health maybe 1.5 to 2x more. Killing the captain Ends the game.\n-We may need special maps for this one. A mix of encounter and supremacy mode. One flag in the middle. Points is up to 1000 but instead of \"capturing the flag\" Points will only accumulate by the number of tanks in the circle, lets say 10 pts per second every tank inside the circle.\n-Tanks Respawn. Can be free for all or team oriented, Team/Person with the most kills at the end of the battle timer wins.\n-Pretty self explanatory. You need to protect some immovable object like a container or bunker while you destroy the enemy's. Will be a good mix of defense and offence.\nEdited by Shin1297, 13 January 2018 - 05:12 AM.\nI think a Free For All gamemode would be a nice way to warm up and/or work on technique.\nFree for all would be difficult to implement, but I like the king of the hill idea. It would need some new maps but there's definitely stuff they could do with that and it would actually place importance on the slower tanks.\nEdited by Shin1297, 13 January 2018 - 04:46 AM.\nEdited by Shin1297, 13 January 2018 - 04:48 AM.\nThe protect a fortification sounds fun or maybe an objective where you capture the enemy flag and have to return it to your base.\nEven a series of progressive captures where you have to cap serial bases sequentially in order to win.... blitz probably isn\u2019t the right plate form for such though.\nSupremacy has damaged this game enough. New modes will just break it.\nOne could design these as separate from pub matches, something just for fun, which wouldn\u2019t affect stats. Or you could use boosters to access...... erm, nm.\nthat's what I'm imagining the king of the hill would be like. Or at least a much bigger cap circle but where shots don't reset the timer, maybe the only pause it. Or whoever controls the hill for the longest duration during the game. Once they control it for more than half the game, they automatically win or something.\nThe Platoon one sounds more like Clan Wars, in my opinion.\nI've reached a point in my life where I've decided I'm not old. I'm actually 20, but with shipping and handling!\ntwice xp for top of the scoreboard and slightly less xp for the bottom of the score board than normal encounters, of course tier-2 get also a bonus and +2 get a minus but that\u2019s been already in game for ever. Same goes for credits. Potential more rewards, but the bottom scum get some little spanking.\ntanks that at least reached the drawing board some day in some real world force.\nuse of multi repairs is debatable.\nso pretty much the game as it was released, cranked up a little bit here and there.\nEdited by minitel_NA, 13 January 2018 - 11:55 AM.",

    "text": "Researchers at Tufts University School of Engineering have developed magnetic elastomeric composites that move in different ways when exposed to light, raising the possibility that these materials could enable a wide range of products that perform simple to complex movements, from tiny engines and valves to solar arrays that bend toward the sunlight. The research is described in an article published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nIn biology, there are many examples where light induces movement or change \u2013 think of flowers and leaves turning toward sunlight. The light actuated materials created in this study are based on the principle of the Curie temperature \u2013 the temperature above which certain materials will change their magnetic properties. By heating and cooling a magnetic material, one can turn its magnetism off and on. Biopolymers and elastomers doped with ferromagnetic CrO2 will heat up when exposed to laser or sunlight, temporarily losing their magnetic properties until they cool down again. The basic movements of the material, shaped into films, sponges, and hydrogels, are induced by nearby permanent or electromagnets and can exhibit as bending, twisting, and expansion.\nTo demonstrate this versatility, the researchers constructed a simple \u201cCurie engine\u201d. A light actuated film was shaped into a ring and mounted on a needle post. Placed near a permanent magnet, when a laser was focused onto a fixed spot on the ring, it locally demagnetizes that portion of the ring, creating an unbalanced net force that causes the ring to turn. As it turns, the demagnetized spot regains its magnetization and a new spot is illuminated and demagnetized, causing the engine to continuously rotate.\nMaterials used to create the light actuated materials include polydimethylsoloxane (PDMS), which is a widely used transparent elastomer often shaped into flexible films, and silk fibroin, which is a versatile biocompatible material with excellent optical properties that can be shaped into a wide range of forms \u2013 from films to gels, threads, blocks and sponges.\n\u201cWith additional material patterning, light patterning and magnetic field control, we could theoretically achieve even more complicated and fine-tuned movements, such as folding and unfolding, microfluidic valve switching, micro and nano-sized engines and more,\u201d said Omenetto.",

    "text": "Available on Amazon: An Sci-fi Action novel filled with mystery and thrills. Join the eclectic crew of the Coalition ship, Destiny Aurora, as they set out to find the assassin responsible for the Commander, Jayce Carver's wife. But what they find will be the last thing they expect and may change them all forever. In the vein of Star Wars, Star Trek and Guardians of the Galaxy all rolled up into one. If you're a fan, you'll love the twists and turns and humor of this futuristic adventure story.\nLogline: Sci-fi/Thriller: A detective takes his crew into dangerous space in order to seek revenge on the alien who assassinated his wife, but when he chases him through a time portal and crashes on Earth on the day of the assassination, he's left with a difficult choice...stop it or allow it happen.\nSynopsis: Lieutenant Inspector Jason Carver was once Head of Security for the Presidential Senate, but when he failed to protect one of the Senators from an assassin, he was given a permanent leave of absence. The failure still haunted him six years later, since the Senator that was killed was his wife, Anna Carver. When Jason attempted to shield his wife from the blaster bolt, it also severed his right hand, which has since been replaced with a robotic one.\nThe assassin, Kunlore Thorne, was known as the most skilled assassin in the galaxy, but why his wife? The question continued to wrack his thoughts. She had been captured by the Zurathi, an alien race of invaders, who had signed a peace treaty with Earth and returned Anna to him two years before her death. She was never the same after that, but he loved her nonetheless. She became heavily involved in the planetary defense grid, which kept would-be invaders at bay.\nAfter Anna's death, he had taken to the bottle, but then became focused on tracking down and eliminating Kunlore. To do that he needed a ship, a crew, and most importantly weapons. Using his former contacts and unused favors, he became a Lt. Inspector in the CSF (Coalition Security Force). Compiling an eclectic crew of misfits with a propensity for loyalty, he set out into the dark reaches of space in CSF Investigator-Class ship dubbed the Destiny Aurora.\nDetouring to planets known for their black markets, he upgraded the Aurora with illegal weapons. Finally, when he located Kunlore's ship, he chased the assassin through a black hole that brought them back in time. Crash-landing on Earth, Carver fought Kunlore hand-to-hand only to discover that it is his Captain wearing a holographic mask. The man tells him that he is from an alternate time-line where Anna was not assassinated and instead signaled for the Zurathi to attack, broadcasting the code for the defense grid through her speech.\nHe hands Carver the mask enabler and tells him that it's him that needs to make the shot. As Head of Security he is the only one that can get to the Senator. He hands Carver the sniper rifle and tells him that if she lives the Earth will be annihilated. He dies from his wounds, leaving Carver in disbelief. The crew realizes they have been brought back to the day Anna was assassinated. Carver looks down at the rifle and the mask as well as his robotic hand. Was the person that he had been hunting all this time....himself?",

    "text": "I grew up listening to Jeff Wayne's original musical and this has so much from the original and so much of its own! Micheal Sheen is superb as the Narrator. I highly recommend this!\nAbsolutely superb! Terry Pratchett and Dirk Maggs at their best! I have been a fan of both for many years and Its a real treat hear them together!\nStephen Fry is fantastic and at 71 hours for one credit it is amazing value. I have listened to all the BBC Sherlock Holmes plays for years, it's great to have them unabridged.\nI had already seen the TV series and loved it when I bought these books. I'll be going straight onto the next one- can't wait!\nAround 30 years ago, two things happened that were to revolutionize the understanding of our home planet. First, geologists realized that the continents themselves were drifting across the surface of the globe and that oceans were being created and destroyed. Secondly, pictures of the entire planet were returned from space. Suddenly, the Earth began to be viewed as a single entity; a dynamic, interacting whole, controlled by complex processes we scarcely understood.\nTravelling to Work is the third volume of Michael Palin's widely acclaimed diaries. After the Python years and a decade of filming, writing and acting, Palin's career takes an unexpected direction into travel, which will shape his working life for the next 25 years. Yet, as the diaries reveal, he remained ferociously busy on a host of other projects throughout this whirlwind period.\nI have really enjoyed listening to all of Micheal Palin's diaries, the way he reads makes me feels he reading just for me and that we are good friends (sadly we are not). I would recommend all 3 volumes to any one with a passing interest in British comedy, TV and Film.\nI am a huge Churchill fan, but i find this book terrible for its bias. Its like reading an article for the news papers but with longer words.\nSome of the metaphors that Boris uses are simply horrible, for example he repeatedly uses the term Nazi EU when talking about the second world war. This is News of the world stuff, again with words that have more syllables than usual.\nI did enjoy this book but not for the reasons the author intended, I was more hopeful of a work by a clearly very clever man.\nFollowing the execution of the king in 1649, the new Commonwealth and then Oliver Cromwell set out to drive forward a puritan reformation of manners. They wanted to reform the church and its services, enforce the Sabbath, suppress Christmas, and spread the gospel. They sought to impose a stern moral discipline to regulate and reform sexual behaviour, drinking practices, language, dress, and leisure activities ranging from music and plays to football.\nThis is a well written book that I found both fascinating and horrifying at the same time. I personally found the narrator very fitting to the material.\nThe Daleks are advancing, their empire expanding into Earth's space. The Earth forces are resisting in every way they can. But the battles rage on across countless solar systems. And now the future of our galaxy hangs in the balance.... The Doctor finds himself stranded on board a starship near the frontline with a group of ruthless bounty hunters.\nThe only negative is that the author seems to ignore completely that the Daleks have been time traveling since the William Hartnell 1965 story the Chase and in the 1986 story.....oh now i sound like a spotter.\nMargaret Thatcher is one of the most iconic politicians of the 20th century. With the possible exception of Winston Churchill, no other Prime Minister has had such an impact on modern British history. Like it or not, her radical social and economic policies have made Britain the country it is today. Without Margaret Thatcher there could have been no New Labour, no Tony Blair and no David Cameron. Now Robin Harris, for many years Thatcher's speechwriter, trusted adviser, and the draftsman of two volumes of her autobiography, has written the defining book about this indomitable woman.\nI really enjoyed this account of Mrs Thatchers life. This book is most certainly not written as a unbiased account, one example would be the description of the Westland affair which had me reaching for other accounts just to try and balance things back up.\nInterestingly the lack of any mention of Northern Ireland or interment is a serious error, missing on a hugely controversial decision taken by the Prime Minister. The author also has a habit of offering relevant personal criticisms of ministers and advisor's that seem to have no bearing on the narrative.\nNigel Anthony's narration is excellent, I felt as though the author was telling this story.\nPlease note that I am neither a supporter nor critic of Mrs thatcher.",

    "text": "Did you know that if you travel to London by train, you can get two for one tickets to a host of attractions? I didn\u2019t until Great Northen and Thamelink told me all about it.\nIt\u2019s actually really simple, you just hop over to thameslinkrailway.com, buy your tickets, and then visit thameslinkrailway.com/destinations/london to grab a 2-for-1 voucher for your chosen attraction. There\u2019s LOADS to choose from, from a ride on the London Eye, to aquarium and zoo tickets and more.\nWe planned our own action-packed family weekend in London to try the offer out, selecting the London Transport Museum as our chosen attraction. On Friday evening, we all piled onto the train, arranged our snacks on the table, and chatted away happily until we arrived into London just in time for dinner.\nOne Aldwych is situated just two blocks from Covent Garden in the heart of theatreland.\nA gorgeous 5 star hotel with stunning amenities, One Aldwych is a great family option as they offer the option of adjoining rooms so that everyone can get a good night\u2019s sleep.\nOur room was up on the third floor and was frankly breathtaking.\nDown a hallway we had the children\u2019s bedroom to the left with twin beds and en suite, the master bedroom to the right, also with ensuite, a well-stocked kitchenette to the side of the corridor, and at the end, a spacious living area with dining table and views right over central London. Wow.\nWe couldn\u2019t have been more comfortable or more well looked after during our stay. This is a wonderful hotel for a family trip to London. Visit onealdwych.com for more information.\nAlmost reluctant to leave our lovely suite, we headed down for dinner at Indigo on the mezzanine floor at One Aldwych. The service was excellent, with the staff bringing out colouring pencils and colouring sheets for the kids, and taking the time to crouch down to their level and listen intently whenever the kids had something to say.\nWe were brought gluten and dairy-free samphire bread to enjoy with an oil dip as we perused the menus and we were relieved to see that children are well catered for. J opted for flatbread and houmous with crudit\u00e9s, while JD opted for the battered fish and chips.\nI selected a beetroot salad starter, followed by gnocci with girolles, peas, broad beans and Parmesan. Both excellent. Mark chose a pork salad with crackling and truffle dressing, followed by lamb rump with samphire and smoked aubergine and capers. A flavourful, comforting selection.\nTo finish, JD chose a generously fruit-filled knickerbocker glory while J opted for marshmallows, which came with a generous jug of chocolate sauce (a rich, creamy ganache) that she poured on for herself before running out of energy and curling up happily on Mark\u2019s lap.\nUnable to resist dessert, Mark and I decided to share a bowl of orange polenta cake, which came with delicate slithers of rhubarb. Divine!\nCheck availability and book your meal at onealdwych.com/food-drink/indigo.\nIn the morning, we woke early to enjoy our gorgeous suite before heading back to Indigo for breakfast, which is included in the room price for most bookings.\nAlongside a fresh basket of pastries and plenty of hot tea/coffee and juice for the kids, we were presented with a good range of options on the menu.\nI enjoyed an excellent vegetarian cooked breakfast, while Mark opted for the meaty version and the kids enjoyed cereal and pancakes.\nWell stocked with carbs for the day ahead, we left our bags with reception and headed out to explore the area.\nWe hadn\u2019t been walking long when we spotted that J had rather covered herself in maple syrup, so we took a detour to GAP Kids and soon had her kitted out in the outfit, which I think she carries off rather brilliantly.\nWe strolled about, taking note of our theatre when we spotted it, then headed into the piazza to enjoy some live performances and a bit more shopping. The kids loved and J didn\u2019t want to stop watching the man who put his whole body through a coat hanger!\nOn the other side of Covent Garden, we reached the London Transport Museum. Using the 2-for-1 voucher we\u2019d printed was easy. Children go free, so we just presented our voucher along with our train tickets, and paid entry of \u00a317 instead of \u00a334. Brilliant!\nJD and I had visited the London Transport Museum before, but it was J and Mark\u2019s first time and it was wonderful to see how much everyone enjoyed it. Across one main floor and two mezzanines, there are a huge number of exhibits and most are interactive, from buses to taxis and tube trains and even a horse and carriage!\nEach child who visits is given a \u2018Stamper Trail\u2019 card, which allows them to collect 13 stamps from numbered points all over the building. It\u2019s a brilliant way to keep kids interested right through the trip, and ensured we visited every corner of the museum.\nThe kids weren\u2019t all that excited when I told them we were nipping back to the hotel for lunch. That is, until they discovered it was a Charlie and the Chocolate factory themed afternoon tea, their expectations were instantly raised sky high..and One Aldwych exceeded them!\nWe started with these stunning bubbling dry ice cocktails, delivered in glass teapots, they completely captured our imagination.\nThen it was time for the savoury course, little sandwiches and quiches, divided into plates to suit Mark (a meat-eater), the kids, and me (a veggie). It was all perfect \u2013 especially the crumbly heritage tomato tart.\nNext came the sweet course, and the children\u2019s eyes were as round as saucers as treat after treat appeared, from blueberry loaves, to conserves and scones, to gingerbread cake pops, candy floss, golden eggs filled with cheesecake, and more! Everything tasted exceptionally good \u2013 in fact I\u2019d say this quite possibly tops the list of my very favourite food experiences to date.\nWith full tummies and happy hearts, we rounded off this magical treat with hot chocolates, before dashing off to the theatre.\nBook your One Aldwych afternoon tea at onealdwych.com/food-drink/afternoon-tea. Prices start from \u00a337.50 (or \u00a327.50 for children under the age of 12).\nThe kids had never seen a West End musical before so we were so excited to head back into the heart of London\u2019s theatreland to see a full performance of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nThe sets, characters and performances in the show were loud, proud and larger than life. We enjoyed every second of this clever show, which boasts original songs and dialogue you won\u2019t have seen in the movies, expertly performed by a highly skilled, pitch perfect and completely engaging cast.\nThe ending, without giving too much away, was beautifully done. I highly recommend going to see this show \u2013 the kids loved it and are already talking about going to see it again before it moves to Broadway in 2017.\nFollow Charlie and the Chocolate factory on Facebook and Twitter and book your tickets from \u00a325 at www.charlieandthechocolatefactory.com.\nOn a high from a truly wonderful weekend, we whizzed back to the hotel, grabbed our bags and then made our way to the station for the train ride home. The children both slept on the journey north, as did Mark and I!\nWe\u2019ll definitely be having another London adventure soon and will certainly take advantage of the Thameslink 2 for 1 offers. It\u2019s a brilliant way to get the most of a trip to the big city. What\u2019s more, the 2 for 1 offer is also available across Cambridge & Brighton, so that\u2019s lots more reasons to hop on a train.\nThis is a commissioned post for Thameslink & Great Northern, who provided train and museum tickets.We attended the show and stayed at the hotel as guests of the press offices. The final three Charlie and the Chocolate Factory images are official production images reproduced here with permission.\nAlso thanks to VisitLondon.com for helping us plan the trip. Do check them out for lots more ideas for London family fun.\n\u00ab Noa and Nani has a new collection of \u2018grown up\u2019 furniture and it\u2019s gorgeous!\nLondon Transport Museum is a great, interactive museum that details the history of transit in London. Interesting for kids of all ages!\nMy mouth is watering looking at all of those fabulous food pictures. No matter how many times I go to London, I feel like I only scratch the surface. Thanks for sharing, Emily.\nOh my, that food photography is simply amazing! I feel so discouraged when I see quality photos like yours, since I never seem to be able to produce high quality images. Guess I\u2019ll have to try harder!",

    "text": "A common question from Sea Kayakers new to Clayoquot Sound revolves around the tidal currents. In many locations around British Columbia there are detailed current speed and time predictions published to assist mariners in route planning; no such predictions are published for Clayoquot Sound. Instead we rely on the Tofino Tidal Predictions published by the Canadian Hydrographic Service.\nWhen paddling in more inland waterways (such as the Gulf Islands, San Juan Islands, Desolation Sound, Broughton Archipelago) mariners need to pay very close attention to Current Speed / Turn times vs Tidal High/Low Times. In inland waterways the time difference between the tide high-or-low and current slack water can often have hours long differences.\nWhen the tides are rising, the current will move flood from the open ocean towards the inlets. When the tides are falling, the current will ebb from the inlets towards the open ocean. Examining the bathymetry lines (the shape of the sea floor) on a nautical chart, one can easily see the deep channels scoured by the currents. As in a river, the fastest current can be expected in the middle of those channels, while the most turbulent areas will be located along the edges.\nTidal currents experienced in Clayoquot Sound will be directly proportional to the size of the tidal range experienced. For instance on a day with a 4 foot difference between and high and low tide one should expect much slower current speeds than a day where we experience a 10 foot range between high and low tides. For reference, the largest tidal ranges we experience in Tofino are about 13 feet (4 meters).\nSignificant changes to barometric pressure (low-pressure from a storm, or high pressure during fair weather) can alter the tidal heights. A strong winter storm will lower the barometric pressure and result in larger tides. Conversely a strong ridge of high pressure will decrease the tidal range. A general rule of thumb; a change of 1 mb of pressure results in a 1 cm change in sea level. Tidal predictions are based on the average air pressure of 1013 mb. Therefore a strong high pressure system of 1033 will lower tidal heights by 20 cm. A low-pressure system of 980 will increase tidal heights by 33 cm. Pay attention to fast changes to weather systems.\nFor the most part the currents manifest themselves as a gentle river moving up and down the passages. Eddy lines can be expected at headlands but once within most current channels the only reminder of the current will be the effect it has on your speed. Understanding how to \u2018Ferry\u2019 across the current is an important skill, both while crossing small passages in the inner islands, and larger crossings on the outer coast. On Long crossings, a strong flood or ebb tide can significantly alter your course.\nPlease don\u2019t mistake the lack of published current predictions as a sign the currents should be ignored. The currents can significantly influence the sea-state experienced in Clayoquot Sound.\nOn calm days with a large tidal range, the currents themselves can create hazards. There are locations we can experience up to 5 knots of current which can generate a standing wave big enough to surf. Many kayakers have run into difficulty by not appreciating the speed of the currents within some channels. Many, but not all, of these locations are indicated on the Marine Chart by current directional arrows.\nOn windy days, the current will play an important role. Within the inner waters, the current can drastically change the waves experienced. The waters directly in the Tofino Harbour are a great example. It is very common to experience a North Westerly wind in the afternoon during the summer months. During a rising tide with a flood current, the wind and current will be moving in the same direction; causing the waves to be elongated and less rough. However with a falling tide / ebb current the wind waves will be accentuated and much rougher conditions can be expected.\nPerhaps the largest consideration with currents in Clayoquot Sound is the influence it can have on the incoming open ocean swell. An outgoing ebb current, will shorten the wave length of incoming ocean swell making the waves much steeper and closer together. Couple this with wind waves, and hazardous conditions can occur on the outer coast. A few locations of note include Moser Pt. by Vargas Island, the Gerrard Group by Flores Island, and Sharp Pt by Hot Springs Cove.\nRegardless of where you paddle a healthy respect for the tides and currents will serve you well.",

    "text": "After Brent oil prices sank to new lows of less than USD 30/bbl at the beginning of this year, the GCC energy market witnessed a further slowdown in project activity from already low levels of activity that has been witnessed in the past two years. While the first half of 2016 saw relatively lower project spends (c.USD 20.6bn) than that seen in H1 of 2014 (c.USD 46.5bn) and H1 of 2015 (c.USD 32.8bn), a look at the project awards in each quarter of this year reveals that Q2 2016 (c.USD 7.5bn) witnessed a c.42% fall in project awards compared with Q1 2016 \u2013 which was already considered one of the weakest quarter in terms of project activity.\nAs this quarter witnessed remarkably low project spends, the worst seen in the past 5 years, a comparison of the Q2 project awards for the past several years was also carried out. Data confirms, however, that low spends for this quarter were due to market instability rather than seasonality. The following figure (Figure 1) illustrates the aforementioned trends in project awards seen over the past two years.\nFurther examination of Q2 2016 spends reveals that this was not due to a poor pipeline either, as Q2 2016 initially had c.USD 30bn worth of projects planned for award. A deeper analysis of the data depicts that all projects above c.USD 500mn that were due for award this quarter, faced delays, and were postponed for award to H2 2016, except for two projects \u2013 ALBA\u2019s Aluminium Plant Expansion Phase 6 - Smelter worth c.USD 2.5bn and Aramco\u2019s Arabiyah-Hasbah Development: Hasbah Sour Gas Field Expansion worth c.USD 1.7bn.\nLack of Funding: Large spenders in the region experienced a slowdown in project activity due to issues related to financing, as governments focus on reducing their fiscal deficits. Data by Bloomberg reveals that energy producers in the GCC more than doubled their borrowings this quarter with Saudi Arabia leading the way as the largest borrower. Saudi energy companies have borrowed c.USD 23.1bn in the past 18 months, almost as much as the c.USD 23.4bn they borrowed over the past eight years. These numbers include credits given to companies involved in oil exploration, production, refining and natural gas services & processing.\nMajor Restructuring in the Oil & Gas Space: Countries such as Saudi Arabia and UAE have undergone major re-structuring within the key decision making hierarchy. While Saudi Arabia saw the replacement of its energy minister to Khalid al-Falih, who is planning to focus on diversifying the country\u2019s energy portfolio, UAE saw its national oil company, ADNOC, go through a major reshuffle this quarter in an effort to drive efficiency, performance and profitability of the business. With major re-structuring taking place in the industry, projects are now experiencing further delays as new department heads are re-evaluating the viability and the necessity of several projects.\nCurrent Workload & Lack of Resources: Kuwait, another large spender in the region, witnessed a fall in project awards due to the fact that the country is currently executing several mega-projects already and does not have additional capacity to take on more mega projects.\nWhile a majority of the GCC countries are facing a slowdown in project activity, Bahrain on the other hand, has witnessed its strongest quarter in terms of project spends in the past decade. This was due to the award of ALBA\u2019s Aluminium Plant Expansion Phase 6 - Smelter. Moreover, the country\u2019s future pipeline continues to look strong as it expects to witness further large spends due to its upcoming Sitra Refinery Modernization Program by BAPCO worth c.USD 4.5bn, GPIC\u2019s Ammonia/Urea Plant Expansion worth c.USD 1.5bn and ALBA\u2019s Aluminium Plant Expansion Phase 6 - Power Plant 5 worth c.USD 750mn.\n\"H2 2016, however, is expected to be dominated by the downstream sector (c.USD 18.8bn) with refining and gas processing accounting for the largest share (c.50% and c.19% respectively within the downstream sector). \"\nA sector analysis of the first half of this year depicts that H1 2016 witnessed very low downstream activity (c.USD 5bn) and was largely dominated by the power, oil & gas production and pipeline sector; these sectors saw c.21%, c.20% and c.18% of awards respectively. H2 2016, however, is expected to be dominated by the downstream sector (c.USD 18.8bn) with refining and gas processing accounting for the largest share (c.50% and c.19% respectively within the downstream sector). While the downstream sector is expected to witness major awards in the second half of the year, H2 2016 anticipates the largest number of awards to take place in the water & waste and power sector (c.29% and c.25% of total planned for award).\nIn order to understand the contractor landscape, a deeper analysis of the projects awarded in the first half of this year was carried out. This revealed the dominance of the Asian contractors (such as SEPCO III and HDEC) that won four out of the six projects which were above the c.USD 750mn threshold, when compared to only two projects won by the Western contractors (i.e. Bechtel and SNC Lavalin). An assessment of the future projects and the contractors bidding for these projects illustrates that a similar trend will be seen in the latter half of the year with Asian contractors, in particular, Koreans, dominating the contractor landscape. Korean contractors such as Samsung E&C, GS Engineering and Hyundai (HDEC & HEC) are bidding on many projects, and thus, have a higher likelihood of winning more projects than their Western competitors such as Tecnicas Reunidas, Petrofac, Saipem and CB&I.\nLooking at the future projects for the remainder of the year, we see that the GCC market has c.USD 66.2bn worth of projects planned \u2013 with Q3 2016 expecting to see the award of c.57% of planned projects. A country-wise analysis for this year reveals that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE will account for c.26%, c.25% and c.19% of total planned projects. However, using Contax Partners\u2019 Tiering methodology (where Tier 1 projects have a 70% or greater probability of going ahead and Tier 2 projects have a 30% probability of being awarded), Contax Partners forecasts that only USD c.USD 28.6bn worth of additional projects have a realistic chance of being awarded this year. Thus, total capex spends of c.USD 49.3bn is anticipated for 2016. Several key upcoming mega-projects for this year include: DRPIC\u2019s Duqm Refinery, Saudi Aramco\u2019s Ras Tanura Refinery Clean Fuels and Aromatics Project, ENOC\u2019s Jebel Ali Refinery Expansion and KOC\u2019s Jurassic Non Associated: Phase 2: East & West Raudhatain Field Development.",

Erik loved the phone call on last week's show, and has something new to share from the mind of Chris Restivo. The man behind Five Plated Coasters writes the show with regrets and news about the future of the business. Rob asks Joe to share his feelings about Erik's brother Jeremy. Rob expresses concern that Erik will exhibit some of his outlandish behavior at a new, and more conservative, venue for the murder mystery. Joe and Katie break down their thoughts on the Oscar nominees with movie critic Mara Reinstein. Rob makes bad decision after bad decision while doing a bit during intermission at the Valentine's Day murder mystery. This turns into a conversation about \"accidental\" texts. Rob continues to have trouble with greeting cards when he goes shopping for Valentine's Day. Joe plans a romantic day starting with flowers from Target and later an over-packed restaurant. Now he's struggling over what to get for her birthday.\nJoe is making Valentines Day plans, but Rob is not. Die Laughing Productions celebrated Justin Schlegel's birthday by presenting him with a very special card.

    "text": "The Alpine field contains more recoverable oil than originally estimated, and more wells will be drilled at the field than earlier planned, operator ARCO Alaska Inc. and partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp. said Aug. 26.\nRecovery is now expected to hit 429 million barrels of oil, up from a 1997 estimate of 365 million barrels, the companies said. The 17.5 percent increase in projected recovery, an additional 64 million barrels, will also up daily production rates, now projected to peak at 80,000 barrels a day by 2001, up 10,000 barrels a day from a previous peak estimate of 70,000 barrels a day.\nProduction is expected to begin in mid-2000 with initial production of 40,000 barrels per day.\nThe companies originally planned 94 wells, both horizontal and conventional. Now, subject to final regulatory approval, the companies will drill 112 wells \u2014 all horizontal penetrations \u2014 for a total of more than 60 miles of reservoir penetrations.\nEnhanced oil recovery will be implemented at field start up, using miscible injectant from gas in the field. The companies said the EOR project, combined with the additional horizontal wells, will account for the increase in production and reserves.\n\u201cThis has been a landmark year for development of the Alpine oil field. As we gather more information about the reservoir, it continues to exceed our expectations,\u201d said Kevin Meyers, president of ARCO Alaska Inc. Meyers said that start up of the field would help to offset the decline in North Slope oil production.\n\u201cAlpine represents another Alaska oil industry success story and is a model for technological advances and environmental sensitivity,\u201d said John Seitz, president of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.\nThe companies said they will invest more than $1 billion, $750 million of that in Alaska, by the time the project is complete. Alpine is owned 78 percent by ARCO and 22 percent by Anadarko. The 40,000-acre field is 34 miles west of the ARCO-operated Kuparuk River field. Alpine surface development will be on 97 acres, with access by ice roads in the winter for construction equipment, production facilities, drilling rigs and drilling supplies and by air the remainder of the year.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management has leases out for tracts won in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska lease sale.\nARCO Alaska Inc. officials paid the agency $55 million Aug. 20 \u2014 the remaining 90 percent of their winning bids and first year\u2019s rent on the tracts.\nMike Richter, ARCO Alaska exploration manager, told PNA that the company wanted to drill at least three wells this year, dependent on permitting and weather. ARCO is working hard on the permitting process, he said.\nJim Ruud, ARCO\u2019s land manager, said BLM had given great turnaround on the leases.\nFran Cherry, BLM\u2019s Alaska regional manager, said the agency was pleased with both the bid response and the spread of locations staked for exploration in the leased area. Both ARCO and BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. have staked locations for drilling.\n\u201cAnd if you look at where the (North Slope) trend has gone, they\u2019re following \u2014 in their industry terms \u2014 they\u2019re following that string of pearls across there,\u201c Cherry said.\nThe next step, Cherry said, is for BLM to do an environmental analysis on the staked locations. He said that most of the work has been done and restrictions are in place, \u201cbut we have to look at each individual site\u201d and negotiate changes or approve it before drilling permits are issued.",

According to police rules, donations by policemen cannot exceed 3 percent of their monthly pay.\nAn unnamed source said part of the funds raised could go to the seven policemen who had been suspended for beating a protester last week.\nThere is concern in the police force that the seven might get an unfair trial. A supposedly confidential notice regarding their suspension was leaked, showing that the seven, including one chief inspector, one senior inspector, one sergeant and four police constables, have been suspended since October 16.\nMeanwhile, Ryoden Development Charitable Trust recently donated HK$1 million (US$128,913) to the Police Education and Welfare Trust, Ming Pao Daily reported.\nA Ryoden Development spokesman said the move is to show its appreciation for the police who have been under great pressure in dealing with protesters.

    "text": "The write-up \u201cDoctor had thyself\u201d (Spectrum, October 4) took up the issue of professional ethics among doctors. Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the lure of lucre and commission culture.\nAll human concerns and considerations are at stake so much so that each patient is considered a milch-cow. But all this is antithetical to the concept of a welfare state. Healthcare matters more than anything else in India.\nThe government, intelligentsia, law enforcing agencies and charitable organisations must rise to the occasion and curb illegal and undesirable medical practices. The marketing of drugs should be strictly regulated and supervised. Justice should be prompt and deterrent.\nThe role of a doctor in society ought to be consoling, sustaining and elevating in order to revive the erstwhile cordial and courteous bonds in doctor patient relationship. Still a roaring practice laced with milk of human kindness, credibility and self-esteem will bring fame, prestige and money. Introspect deeply and act resolutely.\nVaranasi or Banaras (Spectrum, October 11) was one of the six flourishing places in the days of the Buddha. British resident, Jonathan Duncan established a Sanskrit college there in 1792. Mrs Annie Besant, an activist of the Theosophical Society started Central Hindu School in 1889, which eventually developed into the Banaras Hindu University in 1915.\nWhen the celebrated Vishvanath Temple in the city was demolished and a mosque was built there under the orders of Aurangzeb, poet Chandar Bhan satirically said: \u201cBa-been karaamat-e-butkhaana-e-mara ai Shaikh/Agar kharaab shavad khaana-e-khuda gardad\u201d (See the miracle of my temple. Even after its destruction it remains the abode of God).\nPeerless poet, Mirza Ghalib, visited Varanasi on December 1, 1827. He was so much enamoured with the place that he stayed there for about a month. In his poem Chiraag-e-dair (lamp of temple) he admired the city. It comprises 108 couplets, a lucky number for the Hindus. Their rosaries have 108 beads. The poet, who described Banaras as the Ka\u2019aba of Hindustan, says, a wise man told him that doomsday would not come, as God did not want the destruction of this elegant city.\nThe practice of giving English titles to Hindi movies (\u201cDesi movies English titles\u201d, Spectrum, Sept 27) is not new, as many movies have had English titles throughout the history of Indian cinema. First and foremost comes to mind films like Street Singer and President which had K.L. Saigal as hero. Mother India (1957) made by Mehboob is considered a landmark in Indian cinema.\nGuru Dutt and Madhubala came up with an evergreen musical comedy Mr & Mrs. 55. Raj Kapoor produced \u201cBoot Polish\u201d (1956) bringing out the struggles of street children. Another one was Love in Shimla (1959) which introduced Sadhana as a new face. Evergreen hero Dev Anand starred in many movies with English titles like Taxi Driver, House No. 44, Paying Guest, CID, Love Marriage, Gambler, Jewel Thief and above all his magnum opus Guide (1966).\nIn \u201cRoad to happiness\u201d (Saturday Extra, Sept. 12) the writer has beautifully enumerated eight points to achieve happiness, which has become a rare commodity in this materialistic and selfish world.\nI fully endorse his points. Nathaniel Cotton\u2019s verse, which the writer quoted to buttress his points, was full of wisdom, prudence, reason, sanity and practical knowledge.\nIt is said that sympathy is a heavenly quality and should be shown to everyone in trouble to attain happiness. Kindness, goodness and loving care of one\u2019s aged and ailing parents, contentment and peace of mind, the belief in \u201clive and let live\u201d, \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d and practice of ahimsa (non-violence) are the key ingredients of happiness. Noble deeds, good food, good thoughts, good conduct devoid of envy, jealousy, rivalry, grudge, malice, back biting and ill-will lead to happiness. The recital of god\u2019s name acts as an icing on the cake.\nLife is a precious gift of God. It is worth living with all its frustrations, impediments and failures. Those who live it as it comes along can solve problems; overcome hardships to achieve their goals and happiness. One should work and not remain idle to be happy. Bad habits like drinking in excess, smoking, taking opium and other such vices should be shunned as these ruin one\u2019s happiness, home and hearth. Punctuality, the mark of civilisation and culture, must be cultivated to gain happiness.\nThinking about common good rather than about one\u2019s own self, caring more for one\u2019s duties than for rights and providing food, water and shelter to the have-nots can increase one\u2019s happiness manifold. To conclude: Happy is the man, whose wish and care, a few paternal acres bound, content to breathe his native air, in his own ground.",

    "text": "Do you or someone you care about have diabetes? November is National Diabetes Month, an important reminder that comprehensive eye examinations are an important part of diabetic care as those with diabetes can have changes in their eyes and not even know it!\nDiabetes can affect your entire body, especially your eyes. Most diabetic eye changes occur without any signs or symptoms to the patient. It often starts weakening of small blood vessels on the retina, the light-sensing layer on the inside of the back of the eye. As the changes progress, they can actually cause blood vessel to rupture and leak blood into the eye. The diabetic damage can eventually cause permanent vision loss.\nUsually, diabetic retinopathy has no symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. However, diabetic eye changes can be picked up early during a comprehensive eye examination. It examines the front and back of your eyes. It consists of an eye doctor putting drops to dilate (widen) the pupil of the eye, giving a better look at the retina to look for damage from diabetes or other problems.\nUnfortunately, only about 60% of people with diabetes get comprehensive eye exams as often as they should. That\u2019s a concerning statistic! Diabetic eye disease is the leading cause of vision loss among working-age adults in the United States.\nThere is good news! It is estimated that 95% of the time severe vision loss from diabetes could be prevented with early evaluation and treatment. There are multiple effective treatment options including laser procedure.\nIf you have diabetes, remember to get a comprehensive eye examination at least once per year, even if you are not experiencing any problems with your eyes. Also, control your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol as by doing so, you will greatly reduce your risk of diabetic eye disease.\nWatching your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.\nGetting a comprehensive eye exam at least once a year or more often as recommended by your eye doctor.\nWomen with diabetes should get a comprehensive eye exam prior and early in their pregnancy.\nKeeping a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet.\nTo help contribute to better eye diabetic care, especially during this national month of diabetic eye disease awareness, the Southwest Eye Institute has appointments available to examine those with diabetes who have not had a dilated eye examination in more than a year or sooner if advised by their doctor. Call (915) 267-2020 to schedule a consultation with one of our eye specialists. The Southwest Eye Institute is El Paso\u2019s largest and most comprehensive eye doctor group.",

    "text": "The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main trade association for the drug industry, wrote $14.3 million in checks in 2015 to a panoply of nonprofit think tanks, disease advocacy groups and charities.\nThe money is spread around liberally to win friends, to win influence, and to win the influencers to its side so that when legislation comes up in state capitals or in Congress, PhRMA can rely on this coalition to make the phone calls and write the emails that support the bills it wants to pass and oppose the ones it wants to kill.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this money trail.\nPhRMA\u2019s $14.3 million went to 303 organizations in 2015, according to the group\u2019s most recent IRS 990 filing.\nThat comes to an average of $47,195 per recipient group. The majority of gifts, however, were smaller \u2013 $5,000 to $10,000. But if you\u2019re a modest-sized patient advocacy group or local charity, $5,000 or $10,000 is a memorable check.\nPhRMA\u2019s beneficiaries ranged from groups that advocate for cures for specific diseases to universities to Washington D.C. think tanks to local civic organizations to political action committees that give money to candidates running for office.\nPhRMA officials did not respond to requests for interview.\nThe single largest check that PhRMA wrote was $758,495 to the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, a coalition of insurers, drug companies and employers. The organization has vigorously opposed the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2017, which would allow the government to negotiate with drug manufacturers to get lower prices on drugs for elderly patients using Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug benefit.\nThe proposed law has little traction on Capitol Hill, in part because of opposition from Big Pharma-friendly groups like CAHC.\nThe Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2017, introduced in both the House and Senate, is unlikely to pass.\nPhRMA doesn\u2019t give money to just conservative groups, or liberal groups, it gives to all. PhRMA\u2019s strategy appears to be more shotgun than laser: Make as many friends as possible \u2013 everywhere.\nOn the conservative side, The Koch Brothers\u2019-funded American Legislative Exchange Council received $149,900 from PhRMA. ALEC is an organization of, and think tank for, conservative state lawmakers. The right-leaning Americans for Prosperity \u2014 also a Koch brothers-funded group \u2014 got $20,000, as did Grover Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, which is opposed to all tax increases as a matter of principle. The free-market Hudson Institute think tank in Washington D.C. received $200,000. The Republican GOPAC, which Newt Gingrich founded to help Republicans get elected to Congress, got $305,000.\nAcross the aisle, the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association, which raises money for Democratic candidates in gubernatorial races, received $352,500 (The GOP equivalent received nearly the same amount). The Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a group that advocates for LGBT issues, took in $37,000 and the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, an organization of LGBT health care professionals got $15,000.\nPhRMA also supports key ethnic groups. The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which helps young African Americans seeking to enter government, received $20,000, the National Urban League, a civil rights group that advocates on behalf of African Americans who live in cities, took in $25,000, and the National Medical Association (comprised of African American doctors) got $65,000. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) received $10,000 and the National Hispanic Medical Association got $20,000. Even the National Italian American Foundation got some love: $12,500.\nGroups that advocate for cures for specific diseases also are big beneficiaries of PhRMA largesse \u2013 $2 million in total in 2015. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation received $43,800, the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association took in $66,020 and the Lupus Foundation of America got $108,500.\nThe allegiances are highly strategic. These foundations and associations are driven by the family members of patients with often difficult and debilitating diseases. These family members of course want cures as fast as possible for their loved ones. And these moms and dads and sisters and brothers are effective and compelling advocates when meeting with their representatives in Congress or in State Houses.\nAnd each of these groups supported the 21st Century Cures Act, a huge bill that passed into law in 2016 that was a prime objective last year of PhRMA. The bill, among other things, boosted federal funding for disease research but also eased the drug approval process for pharmaceutical companies at the Food and Drug Administration.\nEven contributions to smaller groups can pay off. PhRMA gave $10,000 to the National Grange, an alliance of rural farmers, $50,000 to the Society for Women\u2019s Health Research and $25,000 to Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative-leaning group that advocates for smaller, less expensive government.\nThe first two organizations are part of a coalition critical of the federal 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to provide discounted medications to hospitals that treat high numbers of indigent patients. The drug industry forgoes $6.1 billion each year in profits to fund the program, according to the trade association 340B Health. Not surprisingly, PhRMA has been trying to shrink the size of the 340B program.\nThe group doesn\u2019t mention that the 340B program is not taxpayer funded. CAGW did not respond to requests for an interview.\nThe drug association\u2019s largesse appears to be equally effective at keeping interest groups on the sidelines of the drug price issue.\nIn 2015, PhRMA paid the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Action Network, its advocacy and lobbying offshoot, $66,500. The network advocates for more cancer research money. But a search of its website indicates the group hasn\u2019t actively advocated for lower drug prices, even though chemotherapy costs are skyrocketing. Instead, the group focuses on the overall high cost of cancer care, among other issues. The cost of oncology medicines made in the U.S. has increased by 88 percent to $44.1 billion over the past five years, according to Quintiles IMS, a health care technology company.\nThe Cancer Action Network did not respond to requests for comment on the drug-price issue.\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness received $100,000 from PhRMA and appears to be similarly reticent on directly addressing high drug prices. A NAMI spokesperson said she could not provide an interview by our deadline.\nMitchell is himself a cancer survivor. He and his wife launched the organization with their own money in January because they didn\u2019t see any real patient involvement in the drug price debate. The group does not accept any pharmaceutical industry funding.",

    "text": "WineWalkabout: Walkabout 2012 D\u2019Arenberg, McLaren Vale.\nHeaded to McLaren Vale to sample some world class wines? There are a handful of Winery names that immediately come to mind and one of those is D\u2019Arenburg. In 2012, D\u2019Arenberg turned 100 years old! Four generations of the Osborn family have worked the vineyards and made the wines. They are known as much for an eclectic portfolio of oddly named wines with a bold red stripe on the label that adorns each bottle, as they are for stories have been a central component of what and who D\u2019Arenberg is.\nThe D\u2019Arenburg most people are familiar with revolves around two names, d'Arry and Chester Osborn. Two characters that are larger than life. In 1978 d\u2019Arry was awarded the Queen\u2019s Jubilee Medal. In 1993 d\u2019Arenberg proudly released its most well-known wine, previously just called \u201cBurgundy\u201d for more than four decades, simply as \u201cd\u2019Arry\u2019s Original Shiraz-Grenache\u201d named to honor d'Arry and half a century of wine making achievement. In June 2004 he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honors for his contribution to the wine industry and to the McLaren Vale region. In 1995 d\u2019Arry was invested as a Patron of the Australian Wine Industry in, \u201cHonor of an outstanding contribution to the affairs of the Australian Wine Industry\u201d, two years after completing his 50th consecutive vintage in 1993.\nD\u2019Arry\u2019s son Chester graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Sciences in Oenology in 1983 and took over the reins as Chief Wine maker at d\u2019Arenberg in 1994 after having worked in all aspects of the business. Recently, he was recognized as The Red Wine maker of the Year at the 2007 Japan International Wine Competition. As a wine maker, the awards just keep piling up and with good reason.\nThe wines of D\u2019Arenberg are of consistently good and great quality. Chester actually assumes dual roles as chief wine maker and viticulturist at d\u2019Arenberg.\nD\u2019Arenberg uses the basket press method, not just for some, but for all of their wines, making for a very labor-intensive exercise. Whether it\u2019s this specific part of the process or another, or some combination more likely, the quality of results seem to help justify this as the wines are well acclaimed.\nThe d'Arenberg cellar door is housed in the restored late 1800\u2019s homestead, with views over McLaren Vale, the Willunga Hills and the St Vincent Gulf. The tasting room is relatively large and can handle a good number of people hanging on the bar and the list of wines being poured is one of the most consistently good you will find anywhere. To go a step above some they even pour some of their best like the Dead Arm Shiraz and their Coppermine Road Cabernet Sauvignon. Both of these wines are in the \u20188\u2019 category and are very nice drinkers. There are not too many tasting rooms that can match the wine and the view of D\u2019Arenburg.\nAs if you would need another reason to visit D\u2019Arenberg, it does not just have to be about wine as they also have a top notch restaurant. The views from the tasting room are just as good in d'Arry's Verandah restaurant. Look, go in have a taste, select a bottle and then go have some lunch, you will be glad you did and to give you a little extra push Koala \u2018recommends\u2019 you do!\nCheck out the video from D'Arenburg below!!",

There were holes in the walls and doors, huge stains in the rugs, and the place was downright filthy! Oh, and it was only 3 years old so it should have been pretty nice looking still! Oh well, we got a good deal on it, and after LOTS of work it is beautiful again. I know yours will be as well! I really like the red walls! Keep us posted on the progress!\nMy husband buys foreclosed homes and fixes them up- you wouldnt believe the stuff that he has seen/found. One time he took ALL of his clothes off in the garage and then burned his clothes in the fire pit. The house he had been at that day was infested with FLEAS and they were all over him and his clothes... SO GROSS! Its amazing what a little soap and alot of disinfectant can do... :) You should see some of the houses once they are fixed up.\nAt least she left you an apology note though.\nYeah you can fix things up really nicely. We just moved into the trailor we are in now and I thought it was a hopeless case the first time I saw it.

The sea which can be seen from the room was very beautiful and moved! I entered the pool for two days, so I was free and the children also enjoyed swimming freakly \u2757 Thank you very much!\nAs I heard that it was an established long-established store, the oldness was prepared, but it was renovated, so the oldness was not bothered by both appearance and interior. The room is a common Japanese style room. Wallpaper etc. were also renovated and comfortable. The smallness of the bathroom and the restroom's toilet and the narrowness of the washroom are somewhat concerned, but I think that it can not be helped from the building age. Viking in the morning and evening is impressive! The number of goods was also great and it was delicious. Travel is my hobby and I use many hotels in the same price range, but COSPA is at the top level. Also, it was good for everyone to feel employees. At the dinner venue, I had a good impression of being a woman who asked me to warm up baby food to bring in, and elderly customers who can not take Viking by themselves without being hated. Bathrooms also had a wide open-air stall and good view, and it was comfortable. Little washing space, busy season seems to be crowded. The pool and the jungle spa were delightful for children aged 5 and 1. However, at these two facilities I did not see any employees during the time I was playing. Because it is a place where accidents can happen, I think that employees should be placed. Indeed, spa playgrounds collapsed and children became underlayers, but at that time the employees were not at the spa. Although I wrote various things, it is a hotel recommended for children with a variety of goods for infants in both restaurants and public baths. I would like to also use our house!\nNew Opening in June 2016!\nA clean dining concept \"kilohana\" based on White and Brown.\nBuffet-style menus focused on the pleasures of the ocean and mountains.\nWe have a variety of menus to suit everyone's preferences.\nWe will also provide a child seat for families with small children, along with children menus.\nLooking out from the bath you will be able to admire the vast ocean and hear the melodies of the tide.

Finishing courses and getting points get anyone enrolled in the MVA discounts for Microsoft Certifications and access to special Microsoft promotions related to Microsoft technologies with courses on the MVA.\nThe Microsoft Virtual Academy is free for anyone wanting to enroll in, the only thing needed is a Live ID and being interested in a specific course.\nThe Microsoft Virtual Academy site in itself is very well laid out and as something worth of pointing out, it happens to sport a Metro UI-UX styled design. Something that looks to be spreading over all Microsoft web properties now. And I must say it works very well to make things fluid and pleasant.\nFor further questions about the MVA, the site got a fairly clear F.A.Q page you can take a look at.\nMicrosoft Virtual Academy results in a very interesting hybrid of e-learning portal and promotional vehicle from Microsoft as its main function beyond promoting Microsoft Tech is to help as a easier to follow and use learning aid for those interested in Microsoft Certifications. But that thanks to it being well balanced, works pretty well.\nSeparated by less than a month from the release of Flash 10.2, A new Adobe AIR update is now out and while it is not a major release by itself, it is what should have also been released with Adobe AIR 2.5. In fact Adobe AIR 2.6 got released broken in several releases; From the release of AIR 2.6 for Android that was released in advance of both the Desktop SDK and Runtime of Adobe AIR 2.6, and of course the actual update for currently installed Adobe AIR runtimes that just went live last week.\nThe reason for the advanced release of AIR 2.6 for Android had all to do with Adobe\u2019s strategic partnership with Google, as Adobe needed and more than likely was demanded for this release AIR to spice up Google\u2019s own release of Android 3.0 A.K.A Honeycomb and Android 3.0 based slates like the Motorola XOOM. This way AIR for Android could then fully support the Content Viewer for Android and Adobe\u2019s new Digital Publishing Suite.\nAdobe AIR 2.6 is all about pushing forward the dream of Adobe to go Multiscreen and do so with good performance. Reason why I guess all that it is in AIR 2.6 could not had been released with AIR 2.6 as Flash 10.2 advancements were integral to realizing this.\nWith AIR 2.6, Adobe goes back to truly supporting iOS in the SDK, and they are going back on iOS with a vengeance, as they are now offering a end to end solution akin to what Novell\u2019s MonoTouch does for iOS. Giving Flash, Flex and WebStack devs the comfort of developing in the way they know they are faster with. Leaving it to the AIR for iOS solution to integrate the developed code as a native iOS App via the \u201cnew\u201d AIR Developer Tool instead of the OS X Packager for iPhone; Native iOS apps with the RIAness of Adobe but without sacrificing performance anymore.\nSo AIR 2.6 starts truly delivering Adobe AIR as a MultiScreen solution. In the same way you can say Microsoft is working on making Silverlight run everywhere. AIR 2.6 actually puts Adobe once again completely in the lead, by making it possible to deliver RIA apps that run in the Desktop (Win, OS X, Linux), the Web (Via the Flash plugin) and in two mobile platforms (Android and iOS) with two different form factors. And with the additional promise of AIR being able to deliver Apps to two extra Mobile platforms sooner than later. Starting with The Playbook from RIM and potentially following with HP WebOS later on. You could also wonder why am not also counting Adobe AIR for TV\u2019s. And the simple reason for that, is because it is not truly there yet. But just like in the case of The Playbook, that should soon change.\nTake advantage of new features in iOS 4 like multitasking, retina display for higher screen resolutions up to 960x640, and front and back camera support. Capture audio with the microphone and build applications with an integrated development process when packaging to the IPA format.\nConveniently debug your applications on an Android device through a USB connection with no Wi-Fi setup required. Android USB drivers for Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae are now included with the Adobe AIR software development kit (SDK).\nMaximize graphics rendering performance for Android and iOS by taking advantage of the device's graphics hardware acceleration.\nDisplay web links inside an application (for example, your Facebook application) to quickly access web content without having to leave your application. No need to switch to your web browser.\nSimplify the development of multiscreen applications when soft keyboards automatically appear when required. Desktop applications originally designed for physical keyboards are more easily optimized for mobile devices when you don't have to modify the content or application to display the soft keyboard.\nIs in a sense what Adobe AIR 2.6 brings now, An Adobe that shows they are playing to win by bringing their best RIA game into fruition, in as many screens and platforms they can manage. Making the plight for the RIA a dead serious statement on why Runtimes and Plugins are here to stay and got a solid place in the future.\nBut if words are not enough, here is a video showing what AIR 2.6 brings and the potential of what Adobe AIR 3.0 could then mean in the future.\nBefore there were proper browser add-ons, there were Bookmarklets. These allow you to perform a function you would usually use a browser extension or userscript for. And they are named bookmarklets, because they can be saved in the same way as a simple bookmark, while at the same time they are not bookmarks at all. In order to use them you need to click them in the same way you would click any other bookmark. Usually best to access them from the favorites bar or Bookmarks toolbar in your preferred browser for a improved convenience.\nMarklets is a simple bookmarklet search engine and index, from where you can search for all kinds of these smart bookmarks, as the marklets site aptly calls them.\nRight now there are 99 bookmarklets, but the number should be able able to grow well beyond that as anyone can add a bookmarklet to the site or rank the existing ones. Site is well structured, while sparsely designed in order to make the ads in the site a bit more effective from what I can gather. Not really a bother just a make the site a bit uneven.\nSo what kind of functions can you get by using bookmarklets? Anything from a one click link capture twitter share to a one click website element remover for a easier website screenshot capture, etc, etc.\nBookmarklets are a good way to not having to install unnecessary browser-addons and easy to use and share because they will work in pretty much any browser. Marklets makes for a easier way to get them.\nTechnorati Tags: marklets,marklets.com,bookmarklets,smart bookmarks,bookmarklets search engine.\nBurst Linking is a concept that always attracted my attention from the times it was only possible via a desktop tool running in Windows 95 (circa 1997 . Now the concept is being used along with Shorturl sharing as a web app, which makes this old concept fresh once again.\nBrief.ly is a great free burst linking online tool, that allows you to share multiple links in a single shorturl link. Going also beyond what other similar online tools did by giving you a better landing page for your pack of links with free analytics and even multiple shorturl providers for you to choose from.\nPreviously, I had posted about BridgeURL, which was to my knowledge (at the time I posted on it) the best online burst linker tool around. With only a really big flaw: the shorturl it gave you linked to a website viewer first instead of linking to a landing page with the pack of links you had shared. Which struck me as odd as it goes against the purpose of burst linking.\nBrief.ly don\u2019t does that and gets it right by giving you several shorturl providers to choose from and linking you first to a landing page with the pack of links you shared as it should be! Secondary to that come the iframe based website viewers, they also give you and even the need of you having to be registered to the service. You don\u2019t have to be registered to use brief.ly. But if you do register, they give you some simple analytics for the links you are sharing as an extra. You can join brief.ly by registering a account or by logging in with Facebook. The choice is put at your discretion. I personally recommend registering an account. It is a really great online tool for sharing multiple links in one go, the best one yet.\nTaken from the Ireland Windows 7 Theme, here I bring you 17 Desktop Backgrounds (wallpapers) of Ireland plus 22 custom system sounds made for that theme you can also use if you want.\nThen you just select the sounds you want to change one by one, match accordingly to the file names of the .Wav files included in the zip file linker in this very post. That should give you the same \u201cCeltic\u201d sounds scheme that is added automatically in Windows 7, but in your Windows XP installation.\nIn the case you want to revert to the default sound scheme, just go back to the Sound Tab in the Sounds and Audio Device Properties Window and select the default sound scheme under the sound scheme selector, then click apply. Easy.\nThen you just select the sounds you want to change one by one, match accordingly to the file names of the .Wav files included in the zip file linked in this very post. That should give you the same \u201cCeltic\u201d sounds scheme that is added automatically in Windows 7, but in your Windows Vista installation.\nIn the case you want to revert to the default sound scheme, just go back to the Sound Tab in the Sound Window and select the default sound scheme under the sound scheme selector, then click apply. Easy.\nWhile it was mainly a coincidence, what better day to post a Windows 7 Theme focused on Ireland than in Saint Patrick\u2019s Day right? Right.\nThis way you can easily extend your thoughts of the contemplatively beautiful Ireland from a day to a week. And as the official theme write up says, why would you not if it is all so pretty and nice?\nThis Windows 7 Theme comes with a green tint (of course), 17 desktop backgrounds, but more importantly 22 custom sounds for the OS with an awesome Irish folklore music touch to them apply called Celtic. Simply a very well conceived Windows 7 Theme. Above the average for sure. I wonder if it was put up by someone actually Irish, certainly hope so and if not, lets pretend it was to make it feel even more authentic.\nSome websites and blogs offer intentionally only cut-up feeds in order to make to you click to their sites and make you leave the confines of your favorite feed reader. A practice I personally dislike and disagree as you can easily check from Appatic\u2019s own feed. For that reason I want to offer all of you that happen to agree with me a way to convert cut-up/truncated/limited feeds into full feeds.\nFull Text RSS Feed Builder is a free online service that does exactly what its self-explanatory name implies. It allows you to input any cut-up/limited/truncated feed that only offers a little part of a blog post instead of the full content, and convert into a Full Text RSS Feed.\nOnce you have converted your truncated/limited/cut-up feed, you get a instant preview of how your converted feed will read along with the link for it. Fast & Easy.\nThis is not the first time I tell you about a service like this, before I had posted about WizardRSS and FullFeeds. But Full Text RSS Feed Builder just seems a better option right now. WizardRSS was recently updated but not upgraded. And FullFeeds looks to be now down all the time, maybe even for good. For those reasons I thought that Full Text RSS Feed Builder was worth a post of its own since it resulted better and multiples choices are always good even if for the same kind of services. Check it as it well worth a bookmark if you are a feed reader user.\nPreviously, FilesBoox was a File Search Engine based on FilesPump. But looks like it faced either some pressure or a change of heart and now the service has reinvented itself by jumping in the mirror, while at the same time conserving its name and domain.\nFilesBoox is a quick file sharing and hosting online service. With it you can share any kind of file of any size for quick online delivery. There is no leaderboard of recently shared files or anything like that, so you can either share the file publicly or privately. It is at your own discretion.\nJust load the site and you will see a Browse Files button. Click it and a Windows Explorer dialog will pop up, select the file you want to share and then click Open.\nAfter you click Open, you will instantly see a upload progress bar that will show you the name of the file you are sharing, its data weight and the % uploaded. If you need to cancel, just click the red x button to abort the upload.\nOnce your file has finished uploading, a window frame will appear showing the Direct Download Link for the file you have just share along with a HTML and Forum code with that link for quick copy-pasting use. Finally, it will also show you a remove link in case you need or want to have the file erased. Now you got what you need to share your file.\nFilesBoox makes for a good uncomplicated online file sharer and temporary file host.\nGiven the ease of use and size of the usable site. FilesBoox also makes for a good candidate to be used as a SSB app, if you want to consider that option, I recommend you to use Bubbles for that end.\nIt was back in 2009 with the release of IE8 that Microsoft first started to publicly declare the need for the world of letting go of IE6. From then to now things have only got more and more direct and since last week, the breaking point has finally been reached. Now Microsoft is not just saying it and supporting others declarations for the phase out of IE6. They have decided to put up a site for that goal, and that goal only.\nTheIE6CountDown.com is a educational and promotional site that calls for the phase out of IE6 educating with the numbers of the current IE6 usage around the world and the basic info on why not use IE6. It is also a promotional vehicle for the close to be released IE9 in the case of Vista and 7 users or as a Microsoft sanctioned upgrade path to IE8 for those still using XP as their main Windows OS installation.\nAs of Feb 2011, approximately 12% of the connected world is still using IE6 as the main browser. The goal of Microsoft is to make that 12% a 1% as soon as possible. Something not as hard to do when it comes to common users, meaning those not accessing the internet from workstation. From the detailed stats screenshot below combined with the profiled one above, It is clear that the average percentage of IE6 usage around the world if not counting China, South Korea and India (the top 3 countries using IE6) is already at 5-6%. So the goal of only a 1% of usage is reachable from that perspective, even if I see 3% on average as the most realistic figure for 2011. But counting everyone in, then I would put the reachable target for 2011 at 9% and maybe maybe 7% if things go extremely well.\nWith all this said, it will be a good thing if you want to collaborate and check out on the site to know how you can accelerate the IE6 phase out.\nOk, this one is pretty much only for those that either got a little kid (7yrs old or less) or happen to like and hunt for WPF based (.NET fans) apps. In my case I got a little nephew constantly around and I do like to hunt for .NET based apps, so since I had both reasons, I decided to post about this little App.\nFlashCards.Show is a ClickOnce enabled, WPF based educational kids game app focused in flashcard styled games designed by IdentityMine. Made for Microsoft to be used as a fleshed out illustrative example of a App that went from being a WPF desktop app to a Silverlight based one for WP7 and how the same app can be faithfully transitioned to different mediums. But since it was so fleshed out, I decided that it should not just be used by those doing tech demos at Microsoft, but by anyone that would want it.\nFlashCards.Show comes with 3 different Card Deck classes: Alphabet, Animals and Flowers. In turn each Card Deck class got 3 different kinds of game: Leaning, Matching and Memory.\nThe learning games will show a card a time and if clicked, the card will turn showing the name of what the card is showing. Plus to that it will also show a play button with the audio of the correct pronunciation of the name of what was shown by that card.\nThe matching games will show a wall of shown cards separated by demonstrative cards and name cards. Matching a demonstrative card to the name card will make both disappear and that will be marked as a correct match.\nThe memory games will show a wall of unshown cards. Clicking or touching one card will show either a demonstrative or name card for 5 seconds and will turn around if left untouched or if a match is not made with another card. A memory match should then consist of a demonstrative card and a name card. If the match is made, both cards will disappear and that will be considered a correct match.\nA simple, well designed and free educational game app for kids easy to enjoy. Only drawback about it is that you truly wish it had a lot more card decks and more games. But given the price and the easy 3 clicks install, there is really no much to complain about. App works in XP, Vista and 7.",

    "text": "Every time SINGER releases a new sewing machine into the market, you can expect that it will have some feature that will wow the potential buyer. The same goes for the award winning SINGER 7258, which was designed as a slightly more complex edition of the SINGER 7256. These are nothing like the sewing machines of old, which were noisy, slow and tedious to use. SINGER is now creating technological marvels that no longer waste time and offer the maximum possible productivity to their users. This all becomes clear when we take a closer look at the SINGER 7258\u2019s features.\nAs you can see the SINGER 7258 includes everything the passionate seamstress/tailor needs, making it perfect for all kinds of projects. Aside from the features, the SINGER 7258 also offers plenty of benefits to its user.\nEven for someone who hasn\u2019t worked with older sewing machines, it isn\u2019t hard to appreciate how amazing the design of the SINGER 7258 truly is. After all the 163 year experience of the SINGER company has made them experts when it comes to helping people who like sewing.\nThe LCD screen of the SINGER 7258 is certainly one of its most handy features. This little screen displays plenty of information, which would have been too hard to program without. When trying to choose one of the 100 different stitches, for instance, the button next to the screen needs to be pressed and the LCD screen will shows you which stitch you have selected. A table beneath the screen shows you graphically how the stitch you chose looks like.\nAmong these 100 different stitches there are 9 basic ones, mainly used for crafting simple projects and mending. There are 8 straight stitches that move with you fabric and 76 decorative ones, which add a creative look to your projects. There are six different button-holes programmed into the machine and the option to create another button-hole whose sides can go on for as long as you program the machine to do so.\nThere is no worry about having a hard time seeing what you do, since the working area of the SINGER 7258 is brightly illuminated with a LED light.

The speed slide lets you choose how fast or slow you want to work on your project. You can go as fast as 750 stitches per minute if you want to be done quickly, or spend longer time on tricky projects.\nWhy Should You Buy the SINGER 7258?\nWhen it comes to such an advanced piece of technology like the SINGER 7258, the question should be: why shouldn\u2019t you want one?

    "text": "Pomfret in a Creamy Coconut Sauce Recipe - BFT .. for the love of Food.\nThis recipe was passed on to my mother by her m-i-l, my grand mom. She had had a paralytic attack and yet she was very active. My mother remembers how she was very specific in the steps involved in making this dish. She had the use of one hand and we remember how she still could manage to demonstrate the making of the pomfret in a creamy coconut sauce. The pomfrets have to be cut in a specific manner, the addition of the ingredients has to be timed perfectly and most importantly all the prepped ingredients have to be available at hand to add at the proper time. In order to get the proper consistency one cannot stop in between. The resultant preparation is finger-licking delicious and goes well with steamed rice.\nVinegar \u2013 3 to 4 tsp.\nStep 1: Grind the ingredients for the spiced coconut milk using 1 cup warm water to a fine paste. Sieve using a fine mesh strainer to get the 1st extract (thick milk) and leave aside. Grind the coconut residue with 1 \u00bd cup warm water and extract the thin coconut milk.\nStep 3: Whisk the egg and discard half of the whisked egg. Beat the remaining whisked egg with 3 to 4 tsp. of palm vinegar and sugar till the sugar dissolves. The resultant mixture should appear homogeneous and watery.\nStep 4: Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onions on medium heat till soft. Add the chopped garlic and ginger. Cover and cook on low heat for 2 minutes. Add the chopped tomato and \u00bc of the chopped green chillies and cook covered on low heat for a further 2 minutes.\nStep 5: Put off the heat and leave covered for 5 minutes. We do not want to brown the tomato but we will cook the tomato in the trapped heat till it is soft and cooked.\nStep 6: Re-strain the thin coconut milk and add to the pan with \u00bd tsp. salt and bring to a boil on medium heat. Next add the fish. Hold the sides of the pan and swirl the pan to coat the fish and distribute it evenly in the pan. Do not use a spoon. Cover and cook on low heat for 4 minutes.\nStep 7: Add the remaining green chillies and re-strain the thick coconut milk into the pan. Cook uncovered on low heat for 2 minutes. Add the egg-sugar-vinegar mixture to the pan and swirl the pan holding its sides. Cook further for 1 \u00bd minutes. Add the corriander, cover the pan and switch off the heat.",

    "text": "An optical experiment realizes one of the room-changing operations in the Hilbert Hotel\u2014a fictitious establishment that illustrates some perplexing properties of infinity.\nThe Hilbert Hotel is a famous mathematical paradox about an imaginary inn with infinite rooms. Even when completely full, vacancies can be made through coordinated room switching. You obviously won\u2019t find this place in any guidebook, but the energy levels in a quantum system can mimic the rooms in the Hilbert Hotel. In an experiment using optical modes of a laser beam, researchers perform a \u201croom switching\u201d operation that creates a vacancy by transforming one quantum state into another.\nIn 1924, the mathematician David Hilbert highlighted the counterintuitive nature of infinity with a tale about a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, each having a single occupant. If a new guest arrives, the hotel manager can create a vacancy in room 1 by moving all occupants up one room ( n\u2192n+1). If infinite guests arrive, the manager can open up all the odd-number rooms by shifting everyone to twice their room number ( n\u21922n).\nIn a recent study, John Jeffers from the University of Strathclyde, UK, and his colleagues showed how to perform the n\u2192n+1 shift in a quantum system with an unlimited number of energy levels. The same group has now extended this work to the n\u21922n shift using a laser beam with discrete orbital angular momentum modes, or \u201crooms,\u201d which are characterized by petal-like intensity lobes. The team demonstrated a procedure that changes the room n state to the room 3n state (but it also works for other multiplication factors like 2). This operation could be useful in creating frequency gaps between multiple channels before combining (or multiplexing) them into a single communication signal.",

Additionally, the new iPhone is using a PowerVR SGX graphics processing unit which provides support for OpenGL ES 2.0. The latest iPhone hardware is on par with that of the Palm Pre. In fact, they are essentially running the same hardware (at least for CPU/GPU).\nI fully expect the new iPhone to perform as Apple claims (up to 2x faster) in typical usage.

So last night, all the brands who have been shortlisted were able to give their products to CEW members to try and then vote.\nNeedless to say it was a bit of a free for all, with most people having the same plan of heading for fragrances first, then prestige skincare, then onto the more mass market brands. You just had to grab what you could - a whole room full of beauty-crazed women means dignity kind of goes out the window!\nIt is hugely exciting checking out all the products when you get home. So many amazing classic and new beauty treats to discover and obviously there are a billion reviews to come! Brands who have been shortlisted include La Prairie, Nails Inc, Dr. Nick Lowe, Liz Earle and so many more!\nAll members will be voting over the next few weeks with the winners being announced at the end of April!\nI would have loved to come to this and become a member of CEW in general, I am giving some serious thought and hope to come to the event next year.\nNOTW: Leighton Denny Get Your Cote!",

    "text": "GOP Gubernatorial candidate Betty Ireland appears to be having more problems with fundraising, if the absence of promised TV ads is any indication. Shortly after GOP rival Bill Maloney went up with his first TV ad on April 10th, the Charleston Daily Mail quoted an Ireland spokeswoman saying that their campaign's TV ads would begin \"within the week.\" That was ten days ago and still no Ireland TV ad as of this writing.\nThe same Daily Mail story noted that, according to campaign finance filings, the Maloney campaign had over twice as much money on hand as Ireland's campaign.\nWe noted earlier in this primary campaign that Ireland was having trouble finding the number of donors needed to fund a top-flight campaign. Reports out of Parkersburg indicated that turnout for an Ireland fundraiser at the Blennerhassett Hotel was quite low. Unlike other Republican candidates like Bill Maloney or State Senator Clark Barnes, all indications have been that Ireland needed outside funding to make this race happen.\nWhile it is true that Ireland has the advantage of serving one term as a statewide official, the truth is that she hasn't been on a ballot since 2004--seven long years ago. When Ireland opted against running for re-election in 2008, she forestalled a possible loss, but she also went off the state electorate's radar screen.\nAs a result, Ireland had one overriding mission for this year's campaign. She needed to raise the money necessary to reinforce the public's memory of her time as Secretary of State, to tell the voters how her experience there prepares her for the role of CEO of West Virginia.\nMoney isn't everything in politics. But in a statewide race, it has unfortunately become a prerequisite. Simply put, an individual candidate for Governor can't hope to be everywhere at once. But sufficient funds in a statewide campaign can close that gap significantly.\nIncreasingly, only Bill Maloney and Clark Barnes appear to have the funding necessary to get their message out. Short of a miracle, Ireland does not appear to have the resources to compete against these two better-funded candidates for the May 14th GOP nominating election. This may come as a disappointment to her supporters, but at least the Party of Lincoln offers them other good choices this year.",

    "text": "Beyond Ergo goes beyond the accepted ideas of office ergonomics training because the modern office workplace is too complex for the traditional office ergonomics checklist and occasional workstation assessments.\nNew open plan offices, activity-based or hot-desking options, sit-stand workstations, telecommuting, multiple screens (including personal phones), and new health risks associated with sedentary work have created an extremely complex and dynamic problem for workplace health and safety programs.\nHowever, Beyond Ergo has combined the latest ergonomics and wellness research to create a unique, multidisciplinary and interactive training program that builds the new self-care competencies employees need to make educated health, safety and wellness decisions. These are decisions on small adjustments that may change hour by hour to allow for variations in work, work location, furniture and equipment, and even their health on the day.\nThis training combines the strengths of participative ergonomics, vocational education and training, and wellness strategies to build an individual\u2019s knowledge and self-care skills to manage the immediate work environment, workstation ergonomics and healthy work behaviours.\nThe program also ensures training transfer and encourages ownership of personal health, safety and wellness. Beyond Ergo endeavours to reinforce the belief that risk factors leading to discomfort and injury can be eliminated or at least managed and each trainee can protect themselves from injury now and in the future.\nFounded by Dr Elizabeth Kirk (PhD) in late 2014, the company was initially called Practical Ergonomics but was renamed in February 2018 to highlight the need for holistic, multidisciplinary skill-based training. Training that enables trainees to quickly apply and personalise all the latest recommendations using multiple screens and wherever they choose to work.\nElizabeth is one of Australia\u2019s leading researchers and trainers in behaviour-based office ergonomics and injury prevention, with a special interest in call centres.\nElizabeth started her career with a degree in human movement, before moving into experiential learning, and training and development.\nWorking as an in-house trainer and contact centre agent with a major Brisbane call centre ignited her passion for exploring why existing office ergonomic interventions were not delivering results.\nHer ground-breaking office ergonomics research resulted in her receiving the Dean\u2019s Award in 2013 at The University of Queensland.\nElizabeth delivers her evidence-based office ergonomics training to call centres, government agencies, solopreneurs and businesses across Australia.\nClick here for our detailed Capability Statement in PDF format.

The easiest way to do this is through Spotlight Search: click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner of your Mac, and start typing Terminal; click the result that appears labeled as an Application.\nYou\u2019ll have a small white window that pops up, with a line that most likely has the name of your computer followed by a colon, tilde, and dollar-sign, e.g., janes-mac:~ $. There\u2019ll also be a cursor, which may or may not blink.\nType xcode-select --install (note the space before the two hyphens) and hit the Return/Enter key. (You might be prompted for your admintrator password.) You should see a some output fly by, unless you've installed XCode previously. In that case, you'll get an error informing you that your command-line tools are already installed. Once the script has finished running and you see the dollar-sign prompt again, type git version and press return. You should see git version 2.17.2 (Apple Git-113), or a similar number, output in the Terminal window.\nDownload the Windows installer for Git and double-click the downloaded file\u2019s icon to install it; it\u2019ll probably be in your Downloads folder.\nChoose \"Use Git from Git Bash only*\"\nChoose \"Checkout as-is, commit as-is\"\nGit Setup will then complete the installation; it takes a few minutes. Click Finish when it's done.\nLook for the Git or git-bash icon on your desktop. Double-click it, and type git version into the terminal window that opens. You should see output like git version 2.20.1 or some similar number.\nIf you're running Linux, Git may already be on your system. Run git version in your terminal shell to see if there's any output. If you get a \"Command not found\" error, Google around for the preferred method to install or compile Git on your Linux distribution, preferably with its package manager so you automatically receive updates along with the rest of your system.\nYou'll need to open a terminal window (MacOS/Linux) or a Windows shell (Windows), and type the following commands. Replace YOUR NAME and YOUR@EMAIL with the actual name and email you use.\n$ git config --global user.email \"YOUR@EMAIL\"\nWhen you've run those commands, run git config --global --list and you should see your name and email.

Read about both before making a decision.\nThe first, which is not preferable, is to download and install the Mac Node.js installer from the Node.js download page. Walk through the LTS installer, and accept the defaults. Test that the install was successful by pulling up the Terminal app on your Mac. The easiest way to do this is through Spotlight Search: click the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner of your Mac, and start typing Terminal; click the result that appears labeled as an Application. At the prompt in the Terminal window (the prompt will look something like janes-mac:~ $), type node -v and hit the Return/Enter key.

Once you\u2019re returned to the command-line prompt, go onto the next step.\nTo install Node.js, once Homebrew has finished installing itself, just type brew install node and press return. A bunch of output will fly by.\nAt the prompt in the Terminal window (again, the prompt will look something like janes-mac:~ $), type node -v and hit the Return/Enter key. You\u2019ll see another line of output similar to v11.6.0.\nDownload Node.js by choosing the LTS Windows Installer (.msi) on that page. You\u2019ll choose either 32- or 64-bit. If you\u2019re not sure whether your computer is 32- or 64-bit, you can right-click the Computer icon on your Windows Desktop and look for the System type entry under System. If you\u2019re still not sure, download the 32-bit version.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the installer file (it will be called something like node-v10.5.0-x64.msi, double-click it and walk through the installer, accepting all of its defaults.\nAfter the Node.js installer has run, open the Windows start menu, and type cmd into the search box, which should return a result for Command Prompt. Open the prompt. That will pull up a Windows shell. It will have a prompt that looks like C:\\Users\\jsmith> (with your username instead of jsmith).\nAt that prompt, type node --version and press return. It should output a line of text that reads something like v10.15.0. If that doesn\u2019t work and you get something like a command not found error, try restarting your computer and repeating the steps above.\nAgain, if you're running Linux, I assume you know what you're doing. Google around for the preferred method to install or compile Node.js on your Linux distribution of choice.\nYou now can run the command http-server from any directory (folder) in your file system, and it will be served up locally for you to access in your web browser at http://localhost:8080/. That means you can easily do web development without having to post your work to the web, and without the pitfalls or ugly file:/// paths in your browser if you choose File > Open in your browser. To stop the server, hold down the Ctrl key and press C. That actually stops it; closing your terminal/shell window will leave it running and cause you headaches.",

    "text": "Cardinal John Onaiyekan of Abuja, Nigeria, has expressed his surprise that the Catholic Church in Europe is concerned about homosexuality while they should worry that their churches and seminaries are empty.\nTalking to Austrian fake-news media orf.at (March 2), Onaiyekan stated that the Church teaching on homosexuality is clear and that homosexuality cannot be approved, \"There is no option to change this.\"\nThe gay question has already produced a split in the Anglican Communion. Now, it seems that Pope Francis wants to provoke a similar split in the Catholic Church.\nThe Modernist Popes et al inflicted upon and infecting the Church since V2 have turned it into a sodomite refuge with bathhouses included. Only the effeminate need apply for the priesthood in today's' Conciliar Church.\nOne would wonder if the Churches and Seminaries are empty SPECIFICALLY because of Homosexuality and its evil tentacles.\n1. Churches: who wants to listen to what the mentally ill have to say? Their foundation is poor and therefore their words have little strength or truth.\n2. Seminaries: What Man wants to be LESS THAN A MAN? Not the right sort and therefore NO MAN will want any part of it!\nWho knew? Our ability to come to an agreement on what the Church needs comes back to the old question: \"What came first? the chicken or the egg?\"\nAs hard as it is for me to grasp, it appears some think the solution is to throw open the doors to every sin and vice, look past the failings (because we all have them) and just \"love on\" people.\nDo all things in love, absolutely, but if we're not willing to quickly point out illness and remedy, we will be \"lovin' on\" each other until death. Then what?",

    "text": "Background: Statin therapy is associated with improved survival in patients at high risk for cardiovascular mortality, but the impact of statin therapy among patients treated with trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown.\nMethods: We reviewed 294 consecutive cases of TAVR performed at a single center. High intensity statin therapy included atorvastatin 40-80 mg/day or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day. Study outcomes were post-TAVR adverse events, 30-day mortality, and overall survival.\nResults: At the time of TAVR, 41 patients (14%) were on high intensity statin therapy, 173 patients (59%) were on low or moderate intensity statin therapy, and 80 patients (27%) were not on statin therapy. Society of Thoracic Surgeons projected 30-day mortality risk score was similar between groups. There was no association between statin therapy and the rate of post-TAVR stroke, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, in-hospital mortality, or 30-day mortality. At 2 years, 83% of patients in the high intensity statin group were alive, 70% in the low/moderate intensity statin group were alive, and 57% in the no statin group were alive (log-rank P=0.016). In a risk-adjusted model, high intensity statin therapy was associated with a 64% reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.14 \u2013 0.90, P=0.029) when compared to no statin therapy.\nConclusions: Statin therapy is associated with improved overall survival after TAVR in a dose dependent manner.",

Transfer + City tour + the Incas Sacred Valley + Machu Picchu + Dinner Show + Disco night Tours.\nAn experience of life in Cuzco, the capital of the Inca Cusco festivals and Tours is a special program for those who love to travel and enjoy the nightlife that Cusco offers to its visitors.\nBe in Cusco and not enjoy their grandiose urban beauty is a sin. The entrepreneurs who, in recent years, have been occupying one how much local lent itself to open a pub, a bar or a coffee in the houses surrounding the Plaza de Armashave understood that. Each window of the second floor and each balcony have become viewpoints towards the great square that night, illuminated the Cathedral and the company acquires an even more captivating charm. Enjoy the main attractions of Cusco, Machu Picchu and a unique experience in Cusco.\nDAY 1.-ARRIVAL TO CUSCO, CITY TOUR.\n14:00 p.m. start of the excursion and guided tour in the following attractions.\n(was the main temple and the entire Empire Central) where surrendered cultured to the Dios Sol. Highlights the engineering used in the construction of this place, its walls were covered with gold plates and animals made the precious metal to size, also contained Momias Incas were kept and their wives who once ruled these lands and which were embalmed, the Chronicles indicate that they seemed that they were alive.\nThe city of the Cusco had the shape of a Puma, and the head was exactly Saqsayhuaman. It is located 3 km from the city of the Cusco impressive temple of stone and magnificent architecture, also it known as the House of the Sun. Annually on June 24 is at this place where the ancient ritual of Inti Raymi is performed. It keeps memories of the last battle between invaders and incas.\n(Temple of the Pachamama or mother earth) was a ceremonial and ritual Center, there is an amphitheater where they performed sacrifices of black flames, this every winter solstice \"21 June\" with the shadows cast by worked and polished stones have one very well known is called \"The awakening of Puma\" natural phenomenon that the incas took advantage to start wing great celebration of the Inti Raymi.\n(Inca Fortress) old tambo, outpost that existed throughout the Empire and along the Inka roads. In this case this Tambo controlled output and income of those who moved from or to the Holy City.\n(Royal baths of the Inca and the \u00d1usta) 7 km. The city of the cusco ceremonial center of worship to the water, its name is due to water sources that exist in the workplace, is believed to be resting place of the Inka. 18:30 p.m. return to the city of the Cusco, leaving us in the beautiful Plaza de Armas.\nDAY 2.-SACRED VALLEY OF THE INKAS.\nTOUR VALLE SAGRADO OF THE INCAS.\nP' p'isaq constitutes one of the most important archaeological parks in the region. Possibly its name derives from a type of very common Partridge of the area known as ' p' p'isaqa '. Some scholars suggest that the pre-Hispanic City had the form of a ' p' p'isaqa ' which represented the local fauna. Today there is a colonial town named P' p'isaq in the lower part of the Valley, established as a result of \"Indian reductions\" famous for the quechuas were joined in small towns. The inca City currently offers a Local market, full of crafts and local products.\nThe archaeological complex of Ollantaytambo was a strategic military, religious and agricultural center. The architectural scenario is of exceptional interest for the size, style and originality of its buildings. For the quechua language, the name comes from the word Ollanta (which is the name of an Inca captain, whose history was saved as a written and oral tradition as a drama of Antonio Valdez, priest from Urubamba, in the middle of the 18th century) and the term, tambo, a Spanish derivation from the quechua Word tampu; you mean, \"city which offers accommodation, food and comfort to travelers\".\nAgricultural activity in this area benefited by the presence of the stream of Patacancha, place where was large terraces cultivation.\nThe most typical town of the Sacred Valley of the Incas, is a purely Inca city that the ambitious conquerors wanted to \"civilize\" to implement their culture, but never succeeded, since they resisted completely. Today this resistance can be seen in its people since they live in the almost untouched Inca constructions, in the same place where their distant ancestors lived and formed the largest and most prosperous American civilization.\nRainbow City is located 28 km. to the Northwest of the city of Cusco, on the 3,762 meters, in an intermediate place between puna and quebrada tempered, flanked by the snow-capped Salkantay, Veronica and Soray. The view from here is impressive.\nChinchero was the place chosen by the inca T\u00fapac Yupanqui to establish his residence.\nDAY 3-EXCURSION TO MACHUPICCHU PM: DINNER AND TOUR PUBS, BARS AND CLUBS.\n6:30 am transfer from the Hotel to the train station to take the train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, reaching this village immediately will board a bus from Machu Picchu town to Machu Picchu the Inca city. We will have a visit in the city with a bilingual professional guide, 02 hours, we visit the city on our own. Picchu (Machu Picchu's original name) was one of these llactas, but retained a special role for himself. It is the only one away from the Capacnan and was built in a hidden and impregnable place the Valley of Tampu, in lands of the panaca of Pachacutec (the founder of the Tawantinsuyu).\nIt was the most beautiful of the Empire because it was built to be the refuge and dwelling place of the most selected of the aristocracy in the event of a surprise attack. Roads leading to Picchu were forbidden to the common population, as its location was a military secret. The deep ravines and rugged mountains are the best natural defense.\nAs all important llacta, they did not let be present in Picchu an Acllawasi (\"House of the chosen\"), an intiwatana (solar clock, which mark the seasons of the year), punas (sheds for Warriors), baths and aqueducts, as well as spacious areas with terraces.\nOptional to climb Wayna Picchu mountain, Sun and Puente Inca door or what you see by suitable do in that time.\n22:30 p.m. arrival to Cusco.\nMore late start of our tour Cusco at Night.\nA modern and hectic nightlife only arrived in Cusco with tourists. For them, by the mid-1970s, the local first opened: the Abraxas and the Hatuchay, both in the Plaza de Armas.\nShortly after, the own cusque\u00f1os imagination fueled by the stories that ran from mouth in mouth, were encouraging to face the night cold that kept them cloistered in their homes and were discovering that, at night, people have easier to approach each other overcoming social, cultural and even language barriers.\nWe can therefore say that, its many attractions, Cusco has joined an intense, feverish and cosmopolitan nightlife with an original touch of Andean. Enjoy its charms is one more way of knowing the Imperial City and empathize with his spirit. The lines following are a key to open the doors to this world.\nA good way to begin a night in Cusco is appreciating the singular richness and variety of the folklore of this region, both in its musical expressions in their dances. The traveller will have to choose between the sets of some institutions that folk art, and a select number of restaurants that offer this type of shows.\nBe in Cusco and not enjoy their grandiose urban beauty is a sin. The entrepreneurs who, in recent years, have been occupying one how much local lent itself to open a pub, a bar or a coffee in the houses surrounding the Plaza de Armas have understood that. Each window of the second floor and each balcony have become viewpoints towards the great square that night, illuminated the Cathedral and the company, acquires an even more captivating charm.\nIdeal to tone before continuing the evening dancing are pubs. Usually, they serve until one in the morning and offer happy hour (drinks at half price) at times indicated at the entrance or at the bar.\nDAY 5.-DEPARTURE FROM HOTEL AND TRANSFER OUT.\nBreakfast. Transfer to the airport and assistance for boarding by our staff.\nLanguage English and Spanish personnel.\nCusco tour at night \"Pubs, Bars and nightclubs\"\nTrain tickets round trip and return.\nIn Machu Picchu Gourmet lunch.\nProfessional bilingual (English - Spanish) for all the excursions Guide.\nSupport custom throughout his visit in Cuzco.\nIncome to recreational sites, such as \"Clubs\" \"Hot springs, amusement parks\"\nOther not specified in the program.\nNote : Waynapicchu entry must be confirmed at the time of making your reservation and is subject to availability of places. (maximum 400 quotas per day).\nPaucartambo se ubica al este de la ciudad del Cusco. Es una hermosa ciudad colonial, con sus casitas blancas hechas de adobe, tejas y sus cl\u00e1sicos balcones de color celeste. La festividad de la Virgen de Paucartambo es una fabulosa celebraci\u00f3n que convoca a verdaderas masas humanas de feligreses y visitantes de todas partes del mundo acompa\u00f1ada siempre de su pueblo y sus 12 grupos de danzantes que irradian fe, encanto, color y j\u00fabilo.\nEste tour se inicia a las 8:00 de la ma\u00f1ana, con el traslado desde su hotel al Koricancha. La ceremonia del INTI RAYMI tiene tres escenas diferentes en tres lugares diferentes, se inicia en el Templo Inca de Koricancha en la Avenida El Sol, a continuaci\u00f3n, nos dirigimos a la Plaza de Armas del Cusco, donde se realiza la segunda escena y finalmente, termina con la escena extraordinaria y m\u00e1s grande celebrada en Sacsayhuam\u00e1n, donde nos trasladaremos en autob\u00fas.",

The tv automatically shuts off in protective mode. Make sure the POWER/STANDBY light is blinking and not the lamp light below it. Is the power/standby blinking 4 times in red? If, yes then its a fan that needs to be replaced. If its the lamp light blinking then you need to replace the lamp. The lamp is easy to replace by ordering the lamp either from Sony for $250 or find it cheaper for approx. $150 from other DLP sources and replace youself by following your manual. I hope this helps you.\nAlways buy Sony original lamp for good picture in TV and avoid aftermarket / cheap lamps that can cause damage of TV circuits.\nClick Sony Support to download Instruction Manual copy, if you want it.\nI bought a True replacement from the PartsStore through Amazon.com and it cost me about $185, but it was a Phillips bulb and the full cartridge replacement.

We spent three nights in the small ski resort town Garmisch-Partenkirchen after four days in Amsterdam and before we headed to Prague. Bavaria was our break from the city and in hindsight I wish we had planned to spend a few more days there. We were there in late October and had just missed all the Oktoberfest festivities. The only downside to visiting towards the end of the season was that a lot of the high mountain biergartens were closed for the season.\nAfter doing some research on hiking in the area we decided to head to King Ludwig's mountain palace, the Schachen House. The Schachen House is open to the public from the beginning of June till the beginning of October (depending on snow conditions). Even though we knew the palace would be closed for the season we headed up for the epic views of Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain.\nPark at the Olympic Ski Stadium. After about a twenty-five minute walk down a quite road from the Olympic parking lot you'll reach the Partnachklamm Gorge. The Gorge is open from 8am-6pm and costs 5 euros to walk through. The gates close promptly at 6pm. If you reach the gates after 6pm on your way back you'll have to take the long way back to your car above the gorge, which is an extra 3 miles.\nAfter leaving the gorge follow the river upstream for a bit further until you reach a junction in the way. Hang a left and then continue straight uphill into the forest via the K\u00e4lbersteig trail. From here you gain the most elevation. The K\u00e4lbersteig path will take you uphill for a couple miles, then bring you to the K\u00f6nigsweg path that will take you all the way the Palace. The trails are all well marked and easy to follow.\nEquipment: weatherproof clothing, plenty of food and water, and your 10 essentials.\nDownload my Gaia route to help guide your way.",

    "text": "The 71-year-old Sarasota man was said to have eaten the contaminated oysters on July 8 and died two days later, according to the Florida Department of Health.\nSarasota, Fla. - Health officials say a man died from a bacterial infection after eating a bad oyster in Sarasota last week. He died on July 10.\nVibrio vulnificus is sometimes referred to as a \"flesh-eating bacteria\" but health officials say that label is misleading because it can not attack healthy skin.\nVibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria that resides in warm, brackish seawater. A department spokesman tells us the man also had underlying medical conditions.\nWhile neither the man's identity nor the name of the Sarasota restaurant has been released, the incident occurred earlier this month.\nIt reported $30.1bn in revenue for its fourth quarter, beating already high consumer estimates of $29.17bn. The company cited record levels of job postings and LinkedIn sessions, 41% gain over a year prior.\nBut archaeologists went ahead and did it, finding three decomposed mummies inside a mysterious black granite sarcophagus . Experts were driven from the site of an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus after opening it unleashed a putrid stench.\nGenome editing involves deliberately altering the DNA of a human embryo , sperm or egg before it is transferred to the womb. Before we get to that point, we must conduct further research to establish safety standards, according to the report.\nThere is an investigation protcol in place that notifies the restaurant and determines the batch where the oyster came from so that sale of that specific batch can be stopped.\nSymptoms can include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, wound infections and intestinal infections.\nThe CDC says that Vibrio vulnificus causes 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States. If the infection is contracted through the skin, it can lead to skin breakdown and ulcers. In 2016, Manatee County had two cases, while Sarasota County had three cases and one fatality.\nWhile Vibrio vulnificus is sometimes known as 'flesh-eating bacteria, ' the label is misleading because humans with healthy skin are not at risk. People with a weakened immune system are most at risk for severe illness or death.\nZuckerberg said that as long as posts are not calling for harm or violence, even offensive content should be protected. Facebook has been under scrutiny for its role in letting \" fake news \" and hate speech exist on its platform.\nIt wasn't just what Trump said in Helsinki, it was how he acted - like a supplicant to Putin - and that's the most troubling part. Donald Trump has accused critics who condemned his disastrous meeting with Vladimir Putin of having 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'.\nIn return, Mr Putin wanted permission for Russian Federation to interview Americans the Kremlin accuses of unspecified crimes. But on Thursday Mr Trump said the meeting was a \"great success\" and he was looking forward to their next meeting.\nUS officials have been mum on what, if anything, the two leaders agreed to in Helsinki during a two-hour, one-on-one meeting. When pressed by Alexander, she said she agreed with the intelligence community's assessment \" full stop \".\nCHANG: All right, to talk more about all of this we've got NPR's Scott Horsley on the line, who joins us from the White House. Even then, Trump made only a narrow retreat on Tuesday, saying he misspoke a single word in Helsinki.\nAnnual inflation stayed at 2.4 percent, surprising economists who had expected the rate to accelerate to 2.6 percent. An interest rate rise in August is in doubt after inflation unexpectedly undershot forecasts last month.\nEarlier, the Prime Minister was put on the spot by one of her MPs, who asked when it was she decided that \" Brexit means Remain\". A vision for this country that she set out with great clarity at Lancaster House on January 17th past year .\nSpeaking soon after arriving back from Belgium's World Cup campaign in Russia, Alderweireld did not pull any punches when talking about his current employers.\nObviously I can compete for the long run in a grand slam. \"I know she's going to really enjoy it and enjoy the moment\". Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion, is playing just her fourth tournament since returning to action in March.\nA number of other retailers, from Target to Urban Outfitters, are offering their own deals during Prime Day . Without further ado, here are the best deals from Amazon Prime Day that you can still get.\nThe Ukraine global made 16 Premier League appearances last summer and was expected to be left out of City's pre-season tour squad.\nSturgess died in hospital on July 8 , while Rowley recovered from critical to a \"serious, but stable\" condition on July 11. Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been requested to assist in the investigation.\nKhalil Al-Hayya, Hamas's deputy chief in Gaza, said the kites would continue to fly. \"Your soldiers are still in our hands\". Israel has been accused of using excessive force against Palestinian protesters, an allegation its leaders have denied.\nA couple of metres later, Chris Froome (Sky) attacked, caught Bardet and kept going on his own. I had trouble breathing and now I don't feel well standing\", the Italian said after the stage.\nMost notably, the upcoming installment of \"Call of Duty: Black Ops\" will feature the franchise's first take on battle royale. In just a few days (24th July, to be exact), global phenomenon Fortnite is celebrating its first birthday.\nCheck out the new Fear the Walking Dead Season 4 trailer below. \"My relationship with Rick Grimes is far from over\", he teased. The Walking Dead season 9 panel at SDCC 2018 kicked off with the bittersweet moment from Andrew Lincoln .\nHe mentioned London-based financier Bill Browder , a onetime investor in Russian Federation who said he exposed corruption there. Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that Trump was just saying \"no\" to taking more questions from journalists.\nTrump can't acknowledge that Russian Federation interfered in the election, because that gives credence to the collusion crowd. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week she would back talks with trading partners on lowering automobile duties.\nFormer teammate Nico Rosberg stunned the team in 2016 when he won the title and then announced his retirement only days later. The Formula 1 landscape looked completely different back in 2016, the last time Formula 1 visited the Hockenheimring .\nWill Asensio be donning the blues of Chelsea next season? I hope I will show this when I am working here and living here. Chelsea FC are anticipating a fresh bid from Real Madrid for Eden Hazard , according to a report in Italy.\nShe went on to say, \"He does believe that they would target, certainly, [the] USA election\". According to Sanders, Trump was saying \"no\" to answering more questions.\nI can be strutting as much as I want, but sometimes the real true confidence comes with the result, and I think I'm well on my way to that\".",

    "text": "I have always found the idea of working with markup languages especially HTML which is used so often, quite cumbersome and repetitive. Most of the time we spend building a website is used up in generating and hosting useful content which means tons of p tags, hrefs and imgs to be dealt with. Now there are tons of tools out there which can improve our workflow as far as web application development is concerned. I am particularly interested in markdown.\nMarkdown is an amazing utility that let\u2019s us type in almost plain text to get rich HTML formatted documents. It\u2019s according to me one of those WYSIWYG editors out there. Almost all of the blogging sites use it, stackoverflow uses it\u2019s own flavor of markdown for posting answers and comments. Github uses it for showing a short description for every project it hosts, it\u2019s called the README.md( md and markdown are the extensions to denote markdown source) file.\nParagraphs in markdown can be written exactly like normal text, it\u2019s automatically surrounded by p tags. Images and links can also be easily embedded and code blocks can be as simple as indenting by 4 spaces or using backticks (`). It gives us the flexibility of adding classes and id\u2019s in some flavors(not all).\nI am not saying that markdown can completely replace HTML. Well not yet, but it\u2019s getting there, there is still a lot of functionality missing in markdown. However we can tap all the goodies that it has to offer and generate good content on the web efficiently.\nPaul Irish on the revolution of chrome dev tools.\nWhat interested me most was the slides he used were authored in markdown and during this presentation he edited some of the source in the chrome dev tools, saved and hit refresh and the HTML output was generated, local files were modified and all of this happend on the fly!\nI really wanted to see this happen. So I made a little markdown preprocessor of my own currently hosted on github , here. I have used PHP Markdown and google prettify for the markdown and code highlighting. If you want some client side utility for the same, I suggest getting started with showdown.js and highlight.js.\nChrome dev tools are evolving to replace IDE\u2019s in the future and with tools like livereload , live-edit(already embedded in chrome devtools) and the autosave feature(which lets you map local files to the sources in chrome dev tools\u2013 will ship with the later versions of chrome, those who want to try now can download a developer version of chrome canary), it\u2019s already happening.",

Naturally, NetGalley was there to meet members and clients both \u2013 as well as get the inside track on what\u2019s new.\nThe NetGalley stand was right at the heart of the Digital Zone \u2013 once a niche area within the vast aircraft hangar space of Earls Court, but now probably the most vibrant, diverse and popular destination at the fair. Situated next to the AuthorZone lecture theatre \u2013 co-sponsored by NetGalley publisher Troubador \u2013 we were lucky to hear a series of fascinating discussions and talks about how writers can thrive in the digital age. Many independent publishers and authors stopped off to speak with us on their way back from the stage \u2013 which was hugely interesting.\nAmong the personal highlights were catching up with new and old publishers and members of NetGalley. We especially enjoyed meeting Georgia and Samuel from www.readgig.com \u2013 and you can check out their blog about the fair here. Most excitingly of all was the news that several UK publishers confirmed at the fair that they will soon be joining NetGalley. We can\u2019t tell you who they are yet, but we\u2019ll be sure to announce it just as soon as we can!\nNext month it\u2019s the turn of New York to play host to the literary world at Book Expo America.

    "text": "As the flamboyant hairdresser who clipped the locks of WWE rivals in the \u201980s and early \u201990s with his trademark shears, Brutus \u201cThe Barber\u201d Beefcake was all about two things \u2014 cuttin\u2019 and struttin\u2019.\nA marquee Superstar during WWE\u2019s national expansion in the 1980s, The Barber battled rivals like The Honky Tonk Man and Mr. Perfect and competed in main event matches alongside his good friend, Hulk Hogan, at SummerSlam \u201989 and WrestleMania IX. But Beefcake\u2019s greatest accomplishment may have been his defiant return to the ring in 1991 after a freak accident nearly ended his life.\nFirst introduced to the WWE Universe as an arrogant member of \u201cLuscious\u201d Johnny Valiant\u2019s Dream Team, Beefcake won the World Tag Team Championships with Greg \u201cThe Hammer\u201d Valentine in 1985. But Brutus found his true calling when Roddy Piper defeated Adrian Adonis in a Hair vs. Hair Match at WrestleMania III. At odds with Adonis at the time, Beefcake hit the ring to help Hot Rod snip the villain\u2019s golden locks and was reborn as The Barber in front of more than 93,000 WWE fans.\nNow strutting down the aisle with candy-striped garden shears and barely-there spandex pants, Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake became a fan-favorite as he took down opponents with his Sleeper Hold and cut off their hair. By 1990, the once-villainous Barber had teamed with Hulk Hogan against \u201cMacho Man\u201d Randy Savage & Zeus in the main event of SummerSlam \u201989 and ended Mr. Perfect\u2019s nearly two-year-long undefeated streak.\nThe Barber was on his way to big things when he was severely injured in a brutal parasailing accident in 1990. The mishap nearly killed the Superstar, but he persevered and made a miraculous comeback in \u201991 with eight titanium plates, 32 screws and 100 feet of steel wire holding his face together. Upon his return, Brutus hosted his own talk show segment, \u201cThe Barber Shop,\u201d and teamed with his old pal The Hulkster to take on Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster at WrestleMania IX.\nFollowing his tenure in WWE, Beefcake joined Hogan in WCW, where he competed under a character actor\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of personas, including the lascivious Booty Man, the wacko Zodiac and the stoic Disciple and Brother Bruti. The flashy Superstar will always be remembered as one of the most popular competitors of his generation, which is why he is more than worthy of induction into the WWE Hall of Fame.",

    "text": "Organised crime related deaths in Mexico reached record highs in 2017, according to the watchdog agency Sem\u00e1foro Delictivo and Lantia Consultores and reporting from InSight Crime. In part, the rise in deaths has been attributed to inter-criminal group disputes over control of territories and trafficking corridors, and the splintering of some groups leading to inter-factional fighting. But how best to counter the explosions of violence so often associated with these shifting dynamics in criminal markets? And do traditional counter-crime strategies sometimes serve to entrench the relationship between organised crime and violence?\nPrevious research has called into question the effectiveness of \u2018kingpin strategies\u2019, or \u2018targeting of high value individuals\u2019 in bringing about violence reduction. While such strategies may represent the most direct way of disrupting criminal organisations and effectively capture the headlines \u2013 such as the extradition of captured Sinaloa cartel leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n early last year \u2013 the resultant breakdown in organisational hierarchies and the creation of power vacuums may have unintended, and deadly, results.\nA new policy brief from Justice in Mexico illustrates this phenomenon in action, through an assessment of the recent resurgence of violent crime in the border city of Tijuana. Homicide rates in the city have surged since 2015, with an 86% leap between 2016 and 2017. Alongside this trend lies a high rate of impunity relative to other areas of the country and (perhaps consequently) an enormous lack of social trust: 87% of Tijuana residents say they mistrust the majority of other people.\nThe analysis suggests that the homicide trend can be linked to the breakdown of a previously existing pax mafiosa between the Sinaloa cartel and the AFO, the dominant groups in the region, which had maintained stable levels of violence. This was sparked by the removal of several \u2018kingpins\u2019 as a series of arrests targeted AFO top command in, including alleged leader leader Fernando \u201cEl Ingeniero\u201d S\u00e1nchez Arellano in June 2014. Inter-group clashes emerged, and following the arrest of Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman in 2015 and his subsequent extradition, violence has continued to intensify. This includes both clashes between the rival organisations and the emergence of new groups vying for power, alongside a general lack of hierarchical control among the key cartels. This is reflected in the demographics of recent homicides, which have generally been perpetrated both by and against young, poor male members of marginalised communities \u2013 key groups recruited into organised crime \u2013 and concentrated in a few key neighbourhoods. The problem facing law enforcement is presented as multiple, smaller-scale conflicts rather than organisations operating in large, controlled blocs.\nAmong other recommendations, the report suggests a shift of focus in counter-organised crime policy. Dependence on the traditional go-to \u2018kingpin strategies\u2019 it argues, should be reduced, since the \u2018net reduction in the capacity of criminal organizations does not appear to be worth the thousands of intentional homicides and injuries that follows as a result\u2019. Instead, law enforcement resources should be selectively targeted at individuals who engage in highly violent activities such as the assassination of police officers and mass shootings. Such a strategy may, it is argued, better maximise the use of limited police resources.\nBut what might this recommendation offer in practice? To borrow terminology more commonly used in terms of drug policy, such a shift would represent a move towards a \u2018harm reduction\u2019 approach to organised crime, as it focuses on countering the effects of its presence which so damage the wider Tijuana community, in terms of intimidation, social fragmentation and so on. More broadly, violence and threats of violence play an intrinsic role in the activities of organised crime groups, such as securing territory and trafficking corridors, extortion, and ensuring agreements are kept. Outside a legal framework, violence provides a primary means of exerting power and assuring dominance. Increasing the risks of arrest and imprisonment associated with the use of violence counters an essential part of organised criminals\u2019 modus operandi, and may offer an effective route to countering their progress.However, directly targeting the most lethal and dangerous members of powerful organised crime groups poses risks of increased clashes with law enforcement, which could in turn prompt a spiral of the kind of militarised,hardline responses to countering crime seen widely elsewhere.\n\u2018Expanding the policy toolkit\u2019, to create a more disaggregated evidence and analysis approach to countering organised crime that avoids the pitfalls of the traditional \u2018kingpin strategies\u2019 may be no bad thing.\nFor this reason, the Global Initiative is piloting efforts to develop an assassinations monitor, Assassinations Watch, that maps the use of organised crime and criminal \u2018hits\u2019 as a marker of criminal violence and its impact. Initial studies in South Africa and Nigeria are soon to be published.\nFresh analysis and new insight offers the way forward in the global fight against organised crime and violence.",

Julia Xu, Ph.D., from the Boston University School of Medicine, and colleagues examined how AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance are affected by RYGB surgery. They studied 11 patients immediately before and three months after surgery.\nThe researchers found that AMPK activity increased 3.5-fold after surgery, and oxidative stress decreased by 50 percent in subcutaneous adipose tissue. There was also an 80 percent reduction in malonyl-CoA levels. There were improvements in both body mass index (BMI) and insulin sensitivity, and an increase in circulating high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, while fasting plasma insulin levels decreased. The expression of inflammatory markers was unchanged postoperatively in subcutaneous adipose tissue, although there was a 50 percent decrease in plasma C-reactive protein.\n\u201cWe demonstrated that three months postoperatively, there is a substantial improvement in the patients\u2019 metabolic profile as assessed by changes in body weight, BMI, circulating HMW adiponectin, insulin sensitivity, and increased adipose tissue AMPK phosphorylation/activation,\u201d the authors write.",

    "text": "Hi! How\u2019s the new year treating you guys? We\u2019re off to a good start \u2013 we had a great Christmas break (I can\u2019t lie, Christmas morning is 10x more adorable with babies and toddlers), and we\u2019re thisclose to finishing this flip. Can I get an amen?\nI\u2019m not even sure where I should start with updating you. To say the flip is meeting my expectations would be an understatement \u2013 I\u2019m absolutely in LOVE with how it\u2019s turning out. Definitely my favorite flip ever (do I say that every time?). I love the layout of the house (lots of space, a big family room, oodles of bathrooms), the backyard (it\u2019s bigger than my backyard which is an instant plus, it has a shed for storage and an amazing workroom attached to the garage which I would totally use as a kid\u2019s fort), and the patio (it runs the length of the side of the house and would be a great entertaining space, plus I can totally imagine my kiddos riding tricycles and coloring with chalk out there). So, basically, I want to move in.\nBut what really does it for me are the finishes in this house. I know they might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but they make my heart sing and I\u2019m SO happy that you guys encouraged me to go for this design. I love the finishes more than I love Mexican food, and that\u2019s saying a lot. A whole lot. So thank you.\nEnough rambling. You came here to see photos, am I right?\nWell, I don\u2019t have any gorgeous \u201cafter\u201d photos for you (primarily because we ain\u2019t done yet!), but here are some in-progress shots that will hopefully get you excited for the real photos to come.\nI also have a random question for you. Daniel over at Manhatten Nest includes a diary of sorts at the end of each post about his new flip, giving a brief description of what\u2019s going on each day of the project. (BTW, are you guys following along? Such a fun project to watch from the sidelines.) Is that something you guys would be interested in reading from me? Either in post-form, or in the sidebar? Just something I\u2019m pondering. Thanks!\nYes I follow Daniel too and would love to see you do a similar summary too. I love seeing your before and after as well as your thinking style and choices and sourcing. Love your style.\nHello\u2026love your blog! Almost done w a total house renovation! Can you share where you found the bathroom round mirrors? Thank you!\nHi Camille, congrats on nearing the finish line! I bet it feels great.\nThe mirrors are from World Market \u2013 they aren\u2019t on their website any longer, but I did see one in the store recently. Hope that helps!\nYes! More frequent posts, please! So glad you finally located the Ikea bathroom cabinets you wanted \u2014 everything about that space looks Architectural Digest-worthy. You rock!\nI can see why this is your favorite \u2013 I love it too! Maybe you should move in and flip your current house to save on capital gains.\nMakes me want to rip out my kitchen cabinets and put lighting over my sink and change my windows to dark frames, are they steel?\nYes, a similar summary would be great \u2013 with room measurements would be helpful. Prices would be over-the-top helpful even though you are in another state. I know you are busy but it seems like the blogs I have the most interest in post the least. Little interim summary posts would help a lot.\nMaybe you could say where you got the barn door hardware? Everywhere I look it is so expensive.\nHi! The windows are aluminum, and the barn door hardware was a steal from Lowe\u2019s. Home Depot has it as well (in oil-rubbed bronze, the Lowe\u2019s finish is black which is why we chose it).\nMore posts would be great- love your style. Can I ask where you found that light fixure in the bedroom? It\u2019s awesome!\nHey Laura! That fixture is from Shades of Light \u2013 http://www.shadesoflight.com/industrial-cage-ceiling-light.html \u2013 we used it in our 8th and 9th flips as well!\nYes, I am following him. And yes that sounds like a good idea. I third the more posts.\nYES! to the diary. I would love to see how things unfold in real time for you. How these projects progress in a day-to-day.\nDo what you want that doesn\u2019t take too much time for you, but I love ALL your updates!\nYes yes and yes\u2026 Flip is looking great and I love the diary that Manhattan Nest does!! Do it!!\nI love Daniel\u2019s blog and my heart leaps when I see there\u2019s a new post. His is one of my favorite blogs because I prefer more substantial posts to more frequent posts.\nI gotta say, when I saw the pic of the stained kitchen cabinets in your last post I was kinda meh. But to see it all together? Serious love. Wow. Well done!\nWow! Everything is coming together nicely! I love the design risks/choices that you made here. I can\u2019t wait to see which floor sample you chose. Can you share where they are from?\nHi Bridget! We went with the Dark Walnut (a Minwax stain color), and it will be applied to the sanded red oak floors.\nLooking so good!! Can\u2019t wait to see the finished house! Gets me even more excited to have you design my master suite!!\nWow, everything looks beautiful! I am a white cabinet girl usually, but, man, I love the way those cabinets look with the subway tile and the counter tops. Nice job!\nIt looks AMAZING! and I would love to see a diary of sorts!!\nI like the handles you choose for the cabinets. I think the barn door was a great tough for all the open spaces. And the windows are perfect.\nThanks for the in-progress update \u2013 I\u2019ve been dying to know how things have been coming along on your flip. Funny, but I tend to skip the diary at the end of Daniel\u2019s post; I would much rather have you post the info on the last flips (I think there are a few missing?!), if not your current renovation. Still, you\u2019re in charge and I thoroughly enjoy whatever you can get time for. Happy New Year!\nI love the bathroom round mirrors and the floor-to-ceiling windows! Everything looks really pretty, well done!",

    "text": "New South Scotland (known in Australia as Quadrangle Lawn and formerly known in Zealandia as Nya Ystad) is an Austenasian Crown Dependency situated on the eastern seaboard of the Australian continent. Between June 2014 and September 2016, the polity was administered by the Commonwealth of Zealandia, although de jure Austenasian sovereignty over New South Scotland continued to be acknowledged.\nEstablished on 19 November 2012 as a colony of New Wessex, having formerly been part of an Australian university campus, the colony was ceded to the Empire of Austenasia on 20 January 2013 by Declan I upon the ascension of Jonathan I to the Austenasian Throne. New South Scotland was formally made a Crown Dependency of Austenasia on 25 January, by the First Imperial Decree of HIM Emperor Jonathan I. The then Haakon Lindstrom, also monarch of the nearby nation of Zealandia, was appointed New South Scotland's Governing Commissioner.\nA notable incident took place on 30 October 2013, when two constables of the New South Wales Police were escorted out of New South Scotland by a constable of the New South Scotland Constabulary after they were found asking individuals for identification in a rude manner. The New South Scottish constable was helped by a group of socialists visiting from Australia, who sung the Internationale as the two NSW constables were escorted out.\nOn 22 May 2014, Lindstr\u00f6m - who reigned by the regnal name of Astrid as Queen of Zealandia - ordered the Zealandian military to prepare an invasion of New South Scotland. A false version of events was reported to the Austenasian government, which were that Queen Astrid had been threatened with a coup by rogue elements of the Zealandian military and that she would be deposed unless she sanctioned an invasion of New South Scotland. The queen notified the Austenasian government of her apparent inability to suppress the rebellion, which was eventually allegedly pacified by an agreement by which use of half of New South Scotland would be granted to the Zealandian military in exchange for the force's annexation of new territory for the Crown Dependency. However, Lindstrom failed to pass on information to her government in regards to the Empire's wish for a deal, and instead willingly passed on misinformation, falsely accusing Austenasia of hostile designs on Zealandia and provoking her government into going ahead with an invasion of New South Scotland. Before Austenasia had a chance to respond militarily, a massive diplomatic backlash from the intermicronational community forced Zealandia to accept a compromise whereby New South Scotland would be administered independently by the Zealandian queen, but remain under formal Austenasian sovereignty.\nRelations between Austenasia and Zealandia remained extremely frosty for over a year over the subject of New South Scotland and Lindstom's actions in relation to it, but began to thaw in 2015 after a treaty was signed formalising the arrangement. Relations between the two nations warmed considerably in mid-2016 as a result of uniting against diplomatic attacks from Sandus, and in July 2016 the Austenasian government was contacted by Lindstrom who informed them that she was unable to continue administering the crown dependency due to her and many members of the Zealandian government and military leaving the university which borders New South Scotland. After negotiations, a treaty was signed returning New South Scotland to full and exclusively Austenasian jurisdiction on 10 September 2016. Later that day, Emperor Jonathan I appointed The Rt Hon. Sir Hugh McFarlane, KCA as New South Scotland's second Governing Commissioner.\nNew South Scotland is governed by Sir Hugh McFarlane, a friend of Emperor Jonathan I who lives near to the crown dependency. The position had previously been held by Charlotte Lindstrom, who held the position of Governor when New South Scotland was a colony under Wessaxon rule, and ruled as Governing Commissioner in the name of the Emperor before 10 September 2016. Lindstrom established the New South Scotland Constabulary in August 2013 to provide law enforcement in her absence, although this force had become defunct by May 2014.\nSince returning to exclusively Austenasian jurisdiction in September 2016, New South Scotland has been governed as a normal Austenasian Crown Dependency, being neither taxed nor having representation in Parliament, with the Emperor holding absolute power (exercised by the Governing Commissioner) over the Crown Dependency, and Austenasian legislation not applying to New South Scotland unless it explicitly refers to it.\n1 HM Queen Astrid 25 Jan 2013 10 Sep 2016 Appointed Governing Commissioner of the newly-founded Crown Dependency by Imperial Decree. Monarch of the nearby Zealandia; had New South Scotland administered by Zealandia from June 2014 until September 2016 by agreement with Austenasia as a result of the 2014 New South Scotland crisis. Removed from office upon New South Scotland returning to ordinary Austenasian administration.\n2 The Rt Hon. Sir Hugh McFarlane, KCA 10 Sep 2016 Incumbent Appointed Governing Commissioner by Emperor Jonathan I upon the return of New South Scotland to Austenasian administration. Had previously visited NSS as a tourist in March 2015.\nNew South Scotland has an area of approximately 3.3 square kilometers. The territory is located within the campus of the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and is bordered by the City of Sydney, Australia. The geographical position of New South Scotland means that it regularly frequented by students and teachers attending the university, having a huge effect on the geography, culture and economy of the area. The flora of New South Scotland is not very diverse, only featuring several trees and an extensive grass area. This grass area is used by students as a place to relax, which brings some environmental issues such as food waste which attracts fauna such as the Australian White Ibis. In the interest of preserving the area, groundskeepers at the university maintain the environment by removing litter and mowing the grass. Three pathways also exist, and are used as a major throughway for students and teachers. Drainage pipes and gutters border New South Scotland to protect against minor flooding and rainfall damage; since it is a small catchment area, this task is essential.\nBordering New South Scotland are several areas of varying economic activity, however very little occurs within the borders themselves. Nearby, multiple vending machines can be found, which dispense food and drinks to students. These machines are operated and owned by the university itself, but it is unclear if they generate any profit at all. Numerous shops are located a short distance away from New South Scotland, such as a pharmacy and the university bookshop. A Commonwealth Bank Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) also exists near to these shops which is used to fund transactions across the university. A section of the UNSW Business School is also housed within the large building that is directly next to New South Scotland itself. It is one of the major faculties at UNSW, and teaches a variety of courses regarding economics and commerce and has had a hand in creating some economic activity around the university campus.\nNew South Scotland is primarily used by university students as a recreational area, which has a huge effect on the culture of the area. The grass area is usually a location where food is eaten and where activities such as games and festivals take place. These types of activities define the culture of New South Scotland and how it behaves, as they have a huge effect on the different environments that exist. New South Scotland also features dozens of international cultures, despite having no citizens. The array of nationalities that students who use the area belong to gives New South Scotland a strong sense of multiculturalism.\nClose by to New South Scotland is the university health clinic and dentistry, provided by UNSW itself. Not only does this facility treat students suffering from an array of health complications, but it also acts as an Infectious Control Zone (ICZ), which is used in the case of an epidemic as a location to treat patients. On display at this clinic are pieces of information regarding how to deal with current diseases and what major symptoms are. Whilst these services are technically outside the borders of New South Scotland, should any major disease outbreak occur, New South Scotland itself may well be used as a grounds for dealing with the issue. A pharmacy is also nearby which sells many different medical and cosmetic products.\nThis page was last edited on 19 April 2017, at 09:54.",

    "text": "I could describe the specific steps that led us from attending a quiet open house to the day, barely two months later, when we moved into this 1948 gem by A. Quincy Jones. Suffice it to say, we knew we wanted it within sixty seconds of walking in, and we\u2019re more sure of it every day. But the task I\u2019ve set for myself is to use words to deconstruct this physical artifact, to a degree that attempts to objectify its essence. Here goes.\nThe simple description of the house is this: It\u2019s barely changed from its original 1950 condition, it\u2019s a modest size that feels manageable, and it has a floor plan that is perfect for us. In 1200 well-choreographed square feet, there is a spacious living/dining room, a kitchen more functional than anything we\u2019ve previously experienced, three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a gracious entrance hall. For Los Angeles, it sits on a large lot and has several mature trees. There is a strong visual and physical interior/exterior connection. None of this, however, describes the essence of this house. Why does it feel so good to be in it? Why does it appeal to architects and non-architects alike?\nI believe it\u2019s because the design of the house is a studied, conscious collaboration of intuition and intellect, two concepts that are rarely successfully integrated by one architect. Both aspects of a house can be appreciated by anyone, but in general, I define intuitive those physical aspects of a house that might be found in any good space from any era, may or may not bear the mark of a specific designer, and are typically appreciated more universally. Christopher Alexander\u2019s A Pattern Language was an attempt to catalog those aspects in the built environment. Intellectual aspects typically come with the territory of design education, and they are initiated in a desire for consistency and reason. They may be appreciated by non-architects (and are high on the list of what makes life worth living for us architects), but they can be obscure and hard-won.\nI\u2019ve recently visited several houses by prominent architects built within 5 years of this one, and each one leans toward the intuitive or intellectual end of the spectrum. Included in that group is the Payson House by Chermayoff (1952), the Potter House by Breuer (1950), the Farnsworth House by Mies van der Rohe (1951), and the Glass House by Johnson (1949). Each of these houses is an investigation of larger tenets of modernism and specific interests of its architect. Each has its own character. Breuer\u2019s Potter House may be the \u201cearthiest\u201d of all of them, with its robust stone walls and informal massing techniques exemplifying an intuitive manifestation of modernist principles. The Farnsworth House, on the other end of the spectrum, is a fastidious intellectual exercise, gets an A for its flawless logic, and was, unfortunately, a difficult house for its owner to live in or appreciate.\nAnother aspect bridging both intuitive and intellectual realms is in the structure of the house, which is based on a post-and-beam concept. Its visual expression is something that almost everyone notices and responds to. In a built environment predominated by vast surfaces of gypsum wall board hiding any and all expression of what holds the building up, there is a structural revealing to post-and-beam which is appealing, as well as being visually complex. Here, the post-and-beam system has been reduced to a very economical assembly. Columns are built up of smaller pieces (typically a 2\u201d x 7 \u00bd\u201d core with 1 \u00bd\u201d x 3 \u00bd\u201d stiffeners on each long side). But the consistency in this system, along with how it is adapted for particular joints on the house is quite remarkable. Nothing is wasted. At doors, for instance, the stiffeners are also the jambs for the French glass and screen doors. Every column assembly is integrated perfectly into doors, windows, cabinetry, wall finishes and concrete block walls. The mental process of the architect, working many hours to refine these details to make them consistent and economical, is evident. Indeed, it is an elusive look into the mind of a talented and fastidious detailer.\nA third example of intuitive and intellectual success of the structure is evident in the big, compositional gestures of the house. A desire for complexity is typically a common interest of my clients, although it\u2019s defined differently by each client. For architects, the desire for consistency can sometimes conflict with a desire for complexity. I believe architects are accused of desiring emptiness and reduction simply because they love seeing the architectural concept when it\u2019s clearly expressed, without extraneous details obscuring it. In this house, they both coexist: Order reigns, in the insistent structural grid, the clear expression of shear walls, the use of a specific material always perfectly suited for the task, the form of the house never arbitrary. These attributes would be clear to a second-year architecture student who had learned to diagram building concepts (and to other architecture fanatics). But still, there is much complexity that appeals to others, as well. In a limited palette of just a few primary materials\u2014including concrete block, redwood post-and-beam, douglas fir plywood, tongue-and-groove redwood siding, and glass\u2014a matrix is created with a seemingly infinite number of intersections occurring, each one perfectly resolved. Similarly, an interior division of space with a very limited number of partitions yields a rich suite of spatial experiences: contained, open, ambiguous, defined, et al.\nStill, the house continues to reveal its wonders in layers. As I learn one aspect of its logic, I discover another to be examined. The essence as well as a comprehensive understanding of the design remains elusive. And in the intuitive realm, each season interacts with the house in a different way, imbuing the various spaces with evolving moods depending on the quality and angle of the light.",

    "text": "Well, the good news is that, barring the hanging of the closet doors, extensive caulking and a little touch up painting, the living room is finished and a lovely delight. I am thankful and truly surprised since I wasn\u2019t sure how everything was going to look. I bought a couch off Craigslist about six months ago, grabbed a wool rug half off at Lowes right before Thanksgiving, then snagged a pair of chairs off Craigslist a week after that.\nThe couch spent the last month in the front entry, the chairs on opposite sides of the dining room and the rug was rolled up in the attic. Friday night David finished up the trim and yesterday afternoon Paul and I carried everything into the living room and arranged it.\nThe couch is a medium, brownish green, the chairs are a light camel and the rug is a light green, almost beige with lighter tones woven through. I chose a cream shade for the walls with absolutely no yellow or red in it and the trim is white. The floors are bamboo with it\u2019s natural color.\nIn the weeks while we waited for the electrician, as we stared at the water-damaged tiles of the ceiling that was exposed after we removed the faux beams and first layer of drywall, I began to question the paint color. I had been wondering about the rug since before I bought it; not sure if it would work with the floor and the couch, but decided to buy it because of the quality and the price. I knew it would get us down the road and anything was an improvement on the ancient berber it replaced.\nI thought the chairs would look good with the couch and hoped that there would be enough of a contrast with the rug, but it didn\u2019t look hopeful. I planned to get some pillows or throws for the chairs to bring some color into the room.\nLate in the game of redoing this room, I realized I didn\u2019t have, what those in the business of personal training call, \u201ca vision to lead me through the pain of transformation,\u201d that is, the hope that it would all be worth it. I knew it would be better, and clean and new \u2013 which is NOTHING to sneeze at, I know \u2013 but I thought all the furnishings would look bland and boring or cold and unwelcoming.\nBut when we brought everything in yesterday, it all came together and rather than being bland it\u2019s peaceful, which is exactly the sort of space our family needs.\nMy mom, who had stopped by to accompany us to the Christmas tree farm said several times, \u201cIt feels very calm.\u201d That word has never been used to describe anything remotely associated with me and certainly not my d\u00e9cor, but she was right. I wanted to stay and keep putting things back, but we had an appointment with the Christmas tree farm \u2013 or so we thought \u2013 and the finishing touches would have to wait.\nThe kids do not have school for the third day in a row. Eden has been home sick since Monday and the living room has been piled in the dining room for three weeks.\nWe replaced our ancient berber carpet with bamboo and knocked out the faux beams on the ceiling, hoping to simply mud and resurface it. Alas, the drywall was warped so we had to tear it all down. While we were at it we decided to replace the dingy inset lights. There was a miscommunication with the electrician so he wasn\u2019t able to come until Monday and then a little confusion about whether we needed to take the next layer of ceiling panels as well as an attic full of insulation (we didn\u2019t) so he wasn\u2019t able to actually do the work until yesterday. Tim, the drywaller, is here taping the panels. He should be done some time next week.\nWe generally get our Christmas tree the day after Thanksgiving. The kids are missing it and wondering when we\u2019re going to get one to which I reply, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My sister-in-law offered the use of a miniature one but we have no place to put it. In the dining room we have its normal occupants: our table and five chairs, a low and a long bookcase filled with books. We removed the small secretary where we store our bills to make room for five upholstered chairs, a couch, a dresser, the TV, dvd player, two decorative boxes that store videos and dvds, a side table, two lamps, a compressor and a bucket of tools, 8 baskets that are normally in the living room closet and are my standing pile/file. We couldn\u2019t fit the second couch and so it\u2019s jammed against the wall in the front entry.\nMy bedroom (if you discount the closet which is stuffed with bags full of presents) and the kitchen are the only rooms I have a handle on, though the kitchen now acts as temporary storage for the living room light fixtures, the calendars \u2013 including the large wooden advent one- and any miscellaneous tools and paint brushes.\nMy task this weekend is to divest our home of one of the couches and three of the chairs and the garage of a large entertainment center that doesn\u2019t work for the playroom/attic/residence of doom\u2026when I\u2019m not in class with Eden whose new favorite thing is playing school, having long talks with Lydia or studying with Christopher whose least favorite thing is doing school, but we insist.\nI\u2019ve fallen in love with another man.\nI didn\u2019t really believe in love at first sight until I saw a picture of him and I knew he had to belong to me.\nBeing short and fat he\u2019s not handsome in the traditional sense, but I think he\u2019s adorable.\nPaul has not been at all reasonable, which is disappointing.\nDon\u2019t you think we belong together?",

    "text": "Networking events rank as one of the best ways for entrepreneurs to mingle with potential clients, customers and colleagues. Whether at a conference, corporate gathering or cocktail party, networking events offer a great opportunity for small business owners to meet new people and reconnect with old associates.\nHowever, if you find the idea of mingling in a room full of strangers terrifying, connecting with other business owners and potential customers or clients can be an uncomfortable and difficult process. No matter how you feel about mingling, networking is still an incredibly effective way to meet people who can offer new opportunities to your business.\nWhile a lot of entrepreneurs frequently attend networking events, few actually practice or study the principles behind effective networking. The more practice you have at starting new conversations with strangers, the less nervous the idea of mingling will become. Your confidence will attract others and help you become a lot more than just another face and one more business card.\nTo become a better mingler, give these tips a try during the next networking event you attend.\nHolding a conversation requires the same set of skills as giving a presentation or speech. Practice your public speaking skills whenever you can. Take a class on public speaking or join a local Toastmasters club. When you fee ready, offer to give a guest lecture at a local university or community college or give a presentation at an industry trade show or meeting.\nThe quality of handshake you offer a stranger says a lot about you and your intentions. When you approach someone you don\u2019t know at a networking event, begin your conversation with a firm handshake. Make eye contact as you greet the person, smile, offer your hand and introduce yourself. This type of confident nonverbal communication will better help you build a rapport right from the start.\nWhen holding conversations, an essential skill that often gets over looked is remembering the other person\u2019s name. Saying someone\u2019s name during a conversation helps to establish a connection and show you\u2019re actively listening to what the person is saying. To help you remember someone\u2019s name, try using it frequently throughout the conversation. Should you forget the name, simply offer your hand and introduce yourself. The other person will more than likely reciprocate by introducing him or herself.\nA lot of entrepreneurs fall into the trap of using a common but ineffective approach to networking. Instead of spending time building relationships and establishing rapport, they just hand out and collect as many business cards as possible. However, the best way to create lasting professional connections is to approach potential new customers, clients or contacts with a genuine interest in their hobbies, opinions and businesses. When you start a conversation, try asking open-ended questions to demonstrate interest and sincerity.\nThe best way to form connections while networking is being able to tell your story during conversations. Everyone has some kind of story to tell. To uncover the other person\u2019s story, you need to ask the right questions. You could start with something like \u201cWho influenced you to become what you are today?\u201d It\u2019s a very personal question and should help others open up to you in return.",

They\u2019re called mental models, and you can find them in dense textbooks on psychology, physics, economics, and more.\n* If you\u2019ve ever been overwhelmed by a to-do list that\u2019s grown too long, maybe you need the Eisenhower Decision Matrix to help you prioritize.\n* Use the 5 Whys model to better understand people\u2019s motivations or get to the root cause of a problem.\n* Before concluding that your colleague who messes up your projects is out to sabotage you, consider Hanlon\u2019s Razor for an alternative explanation.\n* Ever sat through a bad movie just because you paid a lot for the ticket?

The Fleet is Working to Change That Status and You Can Help.\nWe want to change this equation by providing vital science education (STEM) programs to students in need, and donations to the School Scholarship Program can help.\nCalifornia students outperformed only Mississippi, Alabama and the District of Columbia. Only 22% of California students scored proficient or above, and only 11% of Hispanic 8th graders scored proficient or above. In a community like ours in which science and technology plays such important economic, cultural and societal roles, these results raise more than mere concerns. The demand for STEM professionals in the U.S. and locally outpaces supply. Currently too few students have the skills that could lead to careers in the field or to even meaningfully participate in the political and social conversations that will arise if we are to meet a range of new and emerging challenges.\nThe Fleet wants to be part of the solution by implementing a new strategic vision to provide experiences, support and programming designed to advance the competency not only of our future STEM workforce, but our community as a whole. The Fleet aspires to change the equation by inspiring and educating students and teachers through our hands-on approach to science education that will feed and maintain a steady pipeline of STEM-capable graduates and lifelong science learners. With your help we can change these statistics by making science accessible to as many local students as possible who otherwise would not have the opportunity to take part in Fleet science programs.\nYour generosity can be its own reward, and ensure our children\u2019s future. Please help by making a donation today!\nOur YOUNG SCIENTISTS Return This Week!

One example he showed was an adapter to be able to plug in an XLR cable to record high quality audio.\nMartin\u2019s one big piece of advice is to practise. The key to getting better with mobile reporting is to \u201ctake the rough with the smooth\u201d.\nHe also advised beginners not to panic. While it can seem daunting at times, Martin showcased examples where there was no choice but for reporters to get involved with recording video from their mobiles, such as when reporting from numerous locations on one story with only one cameraman. Martin told a story of how he was covering the deportation of two buses of illegal immigrants in America with one cameraman. They each went on one bus and it was his bus that gave the more interesting story \u2013 \u201clike a scene from Scarface\u201d. Martin was left with no choice but to use his iphone footage.\nMartin\u2019s final piece of advice was to use mobile reporting only when it was appropriate. He said it is not worth setting up a tripod and XLR cables for an iPhone when the cameraman is just five minutes away and time could be much better spent working out the story and what has happened.",

Thus, it can either have a tetrahedral geometry or square planar geometry. Since CN\u2212 ion is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons.\nIn case of [NiCl4]2\u2212, Cl\u2212 ion is a weak field ligand. Therefore, it does not lead to the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons. Therefore, it undergoes sp3 hybridization.\n[NiCl4]2\u2212 is paramagnetic while [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic though both are tetrahedral. Why?\nThough both [NiCl4]2\u2212 and [Ni(CO)4] are tetrahedral, their magnetic characters are different. This is due to a difference in the nature of ligands. Cl\u2212 is a weak field ligand and it does not cause the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons. Hence, [NiCl4]2\u2212 is paramagnetic.\n[Fe(H2O)6]3+ is strongly paramagnetic whereas [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212 is weakly paramagnetic. Explain.\nIn both and , Fe exists in the +3 oxidation state i.e., in d5 configuration.\nSince CN\u2212 is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of unpaired electrons. Therefore, there is only one unpaired electron left in the d-orbital.\nThus, it is evident that is strongly paramagnetic, while is weakly paramagnetic.\nExplain [Co(NH3)6]3+ is an inner orbital complex whereas [Ni(NH3)6]2+ is an outer orbital complex.\nPredict the number of unpaired electrons in the square planar [Pt(CN)4]2\u2212 ion.\nThe hexaquo manganese(II) ion contains five unpaired electrons, while the hexacyanoion contains only one unpaired electron. Explain using Crystal Field Theory.\nThe crystal field is octahedral. Water is a weak field ligand. Therefore, the arrangement of the electrons in is t2g3eg2. The crystal field is octahedral. Cyanide is a strong field ligand. Therefore, the arrangement of the electrons in isT2g5eg0.\nCalculate the overall complex dissociation equilibrium constant for the Cu(NH3)42+ ion, given that \u03b24 for this complex is 2.1 \u00d7 1013.\nThe overall complex dissociation equilibrium constant is the reciprocal of the overall stability constant, \u03b24.\nExplain the bonding in coordination compounds in terms of Werner\u2019s postulates.\nFeSO4 solution mixed with (NH4)2SO4 solution in 1:1 molar ratio gives the test of Fe2+ ion but CuSO4 solution mixed with aqueous ammonia in 1:4 molar ratio does not give the test of Cu2+ ion. Explain why?\nBoth the compounds i.e., and fall under the category of addition compounds with only one major difference i.e., the former is an example of a double salt, while the latter is a coordination compound.\nA double salt is an addition compound that is stable in the solid state but that which breaks up into its constituent ions in the dissolved state. These compounds exhibit individual properties of their constituents. For e.g. breaks into Fe2+, NH4+, and SO42\u2212 ions. Hence, it gives a positive test for Fe2+ ions.\nExplain with two examples each of the following: coordination entity, ligand, coordination number, coordination polyhedron, homoleptic and heteroleptic.\nThe neutral molecules or negatively charged ions that surround the metal atom in a coordination entity or a coordinal complex are known as ligands. For example, , Cl\u2212, \u2212OH. Ligands are usually polar in nature and possess at least one unshared pair of valence electrons.\nWhat is meant by unidentate, didentate and ambidentate ligands? Give two examples for each.\n(a) Unidentate ligands: Ligands with only one donor sites are called unidentate ligands. For e.g., , Cl\u2212 etc.\nThe charge on the complex is \u22122.\nList various types of isomerism possible for coordination compounds, giving an example of each.\nHow many geometrical isomers are possible in the following coordination entities?\n(i) For [Cr(C2O4)3]3\u2212, no geometric isomer is possible as it is a bidentate ligand.\nOptical isomerism Since only cis isomer is optically active, it shows optical isomerism.\nIn total, three isomers are possible.\nWrite all the geometrical isomers of [Pt(NH3)(Br)(Cl)(py)] and how many of these will exhibit optical isomers?\nIn both these cases, the weak field ligand water is replaced by the F\u2212 and Cl\u2212 ions.\nWhat is the coordination entity formed when excess of aqueous KCN is added to an aqueous solution of copper sulphate? Why is it that no precipitate of copper sulphide is obtained when H2S(g) is passed through this solution?\nThus, the coordination entity formed in the process is K2[Cu(CN)4]. is a very stable complex, which does not ionize to give Cu2+ ions when added to water. Hence, Cu2+ ions are not precipitated when H2S(g) is passed through the solution.\nAs CN\u2212 is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of the unpaired 3d electrons.\n6 electron pairs from CN\u2212 ions occupy the six hybrid d2sp3orbitals.\nThere are 6 F\u2212 ions. Thus, it will undergo d2sp3 or sp3d2 hybridization. As F\u2212 is a weak field ligand, it does not cause the pairing of the electrons in the 3d orbital. Hence, the most feasible hybridization is sp3d2.\nHence, the geometry of the complex is octahedral and paramagnetic.\nDraw figure to show the splitting of d orbitals in an octahedral crystal field.\nThe splitting of the d orbitals in an octahedral field takes palce in such a way that , experience a rise in energy and form the eg level, while dxy, dyzand dzx experience a fall in energy and form the t2g level.\nWhat is spectrochemical series? Explain the difference between a weak field ligand and a strong field ligand.\nWhat is crystal field splitting energy? How does the magnitude of \u0394o decide the actual configuration of d-orbitals in a coordination entity?\n[Cr(NH3)6]3+ is paramagnetic while [Ni(CN)4]2\u2212 is diamagnetic. Explain why?\nIn [Ni(CN)4]2\u2212, Ni exists in the +2 oxidation state i.e., d8 configuration.\nCN\u2212 is a strong field ligand. It causes the pairing of the 3d orbital electrons. Then, Ni2+ undergoes dsp2 hybridization.\nA solution of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ is green but a solution of [Ni(CN)4]2\u2212 is colourless. Explain.\nIn [Ni(H2O)6]2+, is a weak field ligand. Therefore, there are unpaired electrons in Ni2+. In this complex, the d electrons from the lower energy level can be excited to the higher energy level i.e., the possibility of d\u2212d transition is present. Hence, Ni(H2O)6]2+ is coloured.\nIn [Ni(CN)4]2\u2212, the electrons are all paired as CN\u2013 is a strong field ligand. Therefore, d-d transition is not possible in [Ni(CN)4]2\u2212. Hence, it is colourless.\n[Fe(CN)6]4\u2212 and [Fe(H2O)6]2+ are of different colours in dilute solutions. Why?\nThe colour of a particular coordination compound depends on the magnitude of the crystal-field splitting energy, \u0394. This CFSE in turn depends on the nature of the ligand. In case of [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212 and [Fe(H2O)6]2+, the colour differs because there is a difference in the CFSE. Now, CN\u2212 is a strong field ligand having a higher CFSE value as compared to the CFSE value of water. This means that the absorption of energy for the intra d-d transition also differs. Hence, the transmitted colour also differs.\nDiscuss the nature of bonding in metal carbonyls.\nThe metal-carbon bonds in metal carbonyls have both \u03c3 and \u03c0 characters. A \u03c3 bond is formed when the carbonyl carbon donates a lone pair of electrons to the vacant orbital of the metal. A \u03c0 bond is formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from the filled metal d orbital into the vacant anti-bonding \u03c0* orbital (also known as back bonding of the carbonyl group). The \u03c3 bond strengthens the \u03c0 bond and vice-versa. Thus, a synergic effect is created due to this metal-ligand bonding. This synergic effect strengthens the bond between CO and the metal.\nThe d orbital occupation for Co3+ is t2g6eg0.\nWhat is meant by stability of a coordination compound in solution? State the factors which govern stability of complexes.\nWhat is meant by the chelate effect? Give an example.\nHow many ions are produced from the complex Co(NH3)6Cl2 in solution?\nThus, [Co(NH3)6]+ along with two Cl\u2212 ions are produced.\nAmongst the following ions which one has the highest magnetic moment value?\nTherefore, the complex can be written as K+[Co(CO)4]\u2212. Therefore, the oxidation number of Co in the given complex is \u22121. Hence, option (iii) is correct.\nWe know that the stability of a complex increases by chelation. Therefore, the most stable complex is [Fe(C2O4)3]3\u2212.",

Connie\u2019s been working her full 20 hour per week maximum for the past 4 o 5 weeks trying to get all of her students placed. She\u2019s dealing with a total of 3 classes getting scheduled right now and finally has enough spots for all of them but they\u2019re being very slow in getting all of their paperwork requirements completed so that they can go out on clinical.\nBeyond that we had Valentines Day dinner out\u2026we went to a place named the Elephant Bar and Grill. This is a chain with about 20 or so locations across the country and we thought it was pretty decent back when we were in our early 30\u2019s in San Diego\u2026but our tastes have changed and the decor, service from the wait staff, and overall vibe just didn\u2019t do it for us. The food was pretty good but overall it was pretty much a bust.\nConnie won twice at Bingo in the past week as well. Neil got some new hardware and rehung our sign out front\u2026the original brass plated cup hooks he used rusted away so he replaced them with a pair of stainless screw eyes. We also bought some new solar powered walk lights about a foot high\u2026got six of these to put around our patio and light up our entrance approach a little.\nThe main data storage drive in our file server died\u2026luckily no data was lost as Neil has lots of backups. It was a 1.5 TB drive and he bought a pair of 3 TB drives to replace it and it\u2019s mirror backup with. He thought he was being smart and just got bare drives with the intention of putting them into the existing cases since bare drives are 80 bucks cheaper each. Got the new drives and discovered that the old cases won\u2019t support a 3 TB drive\u2026so he got an RMA and shipped them back and ordered two new drives with cases. They\u2019ll be here Tuesday or so and we\u2019ll have our IT systems back up to full capability. He also bought a small fan to put up in our overhead storage area (over the fridge) where the drives live to give a little more air flow across them and help keep them cool.\nThursday we decided to head out on a kayak trip; after some discussion we elected to head over to the Jn Ding Darling NWR over on Sanibel Island about 30 miles from Seminole. While the kayaking was pretty decent\u2026the traffic was horrible. When we got over to the entrance to the toll plaza for the causeway over to the island (6 bucks to get over, gotta be rich to live over there I guess) there was a 30 minute backup and then we limped along taking another 30 minutes to get the 2.5 miles out to the NWR parking lot. Had a nice kayak paddle through Tarpon Bay and some of the mangrove marsh areas and headed back only to find out the traffic was even worse. Took an hour to get off the island and then another hour to get home since it was rush hour by that time and we had to deal with commuter traffic. We won\u2019t go over there again, there\u2019s another paddling place a lot closer and easier to get to.\nHad dinner at the Elks last night\u2026fish fry night all you can eat for 9 bucks. That and a coupla pitchers of beer (Amber Boch\u2026not great but it\u2019s the darkest brew they have) made a pretty outstanding dinner. Neil took out some lamb chops that he\u2019ll grill tomorrow and then we\u2019ll have leftovers for Monday night since there are 8 in the package.\nSorry, I didn\u2019t get any pictures on the kayak trip\u2026we lost our waterproof camera and have to buy a new one (or else a waterproof iPhone case) for ourselves.\nStarted working on our post Sevierville travel plans today; we had already figured out from Mar 15 when we leave through the beginning of May and today Connie figured out the plan through mid June when we arrive at Camp Horizons in Junction City. While the rig is getting some work done on it we\u2019re headed off for vacation for 3 weeks. We\u2019re almost completed figuring out what it will be\u2026will post details as soon as they\u2019re finalized.\nYUM!! Keep BabySis posted on your travel schedule and ETA in Knoxvegas area!",

    "text": "There Are Hundreds of Practicing Exorcists in the U.S.\nA recent survey of modern exorcists reveals a surprising lack of drama in the business of casting out demons.\nThis Halloween, just shy of the 40th anniversary of the movie The Exorcist, has seen the novel\u2019s author and the movie\u2019s producer, William Peter Blatty, get an extra dollop of the attention he sees around this holiday. Not that people aren\u2019t already obsessed by the subject\u2014The Exorcist remains, in inflation adjusted box office, the most popular R-rated film ever.\nAt my own Catholic high school, the Christian Brother teachers (yeah, the brandy guys) could be remarkably post-Vatican II flip and modern about most things doctrinal, but they got sober really fast about not messing around with demon-y things. Their sudden seriousness always made me wonder if they knew something. Every once in a while, I still wonder about that.\nI\u2019m not the only one. Writing last year in The Journal of Christian Ministry, University of Kentucky psychometrician Kenneth D. Royal described his survey of modern American exorcists.\nThose last three words, outside of Hollywood, might sound like an oxymoron. Beside the odd story about some loony parents whose child dies while the ham-handed cast out demons, surely any instance of demonic possession is just a certain kind of psychological malady, and exorcism just a ridiculous exercise. If somebody\u2019s better after an exorcism, light a candle to Saint Placebo. Plus, garden-variety evil seems to be doing a damned good job without extra-curricular shenanigans.\nIn such cases good communication with priests is recommended, but we are surprised that in 21st century and in Europe, there are still experts and clerics who believe that some types of schizophrenia are due to demonic possession. Our intention was to ask an expert cleric from the Madrid archdiocese to try to convince the patient that her symptoms were due to a mental disorder, in an effort to improve her insight. To our surprise, clerics assumed that the patient&apos;s psychotic symptoms were due to a malign presence.\nIn the U.S., exorcism takes on a mostly Christian cast, although evennon-Abrahamic religions recognize the practice. The bias here is probably because culturally we\u2019re mostly Christian and the New Testament is chock full of demons being cast out, usually by Jesus but sometimes by his followers in his name. But there are demons in the Old Testament, too, and in Jesus\u2019 day casting them out was a recognized job in the Jewish community. Professional exorcists also were acknowledged in the early days of the Christian church.\nTwo millennia later, in 1972, Pope Paul VI abolished the minor order of exorcist, but that was more of a human resources reshuffling of roles (porter and catechist also got the papal boot) than a statement that exorcism was pass\u00e9. Nonetheless, in 1999 the Vatican updated its 300-plus-year-old exorcism regulations and said an allegedly possessed person should be given a thorough medical and psychological exam before phoning the Jesuit hotline.\nBetween talking with Christian leaders, authors of texts on exorcism, and an Internet posting, Royal was able to reach out to 316 (!) American exorcists. Some 170 answered his survey. Fifteen of these 170 took part in an additional personal interview. Most of the larger set were men, most were Protestant (all the big denominations, including the so-called mainline ones, were represented), and most had \u201cset demonized people free\u201d between 11 and 1,000 times.\nFurthermore, most practicing exorcists (but not Catholic ones) believe that \u201cany mature Christian\u201d has the necessary authority to cast out demons.\nNonetheless, fasting, along with being patient and humble, were seen as necessary or at least useful preparations for the casting out. \u201cSatan,\" One interviewee told Royal, \"has no equipment to fight humility.\u201d That might be a useful prescription for fighting any sort of devil these days.\nWho Wants a Christian America?\nA look at the results of a recent YouGov survey.\nThe went-to-heaven-and-back genre is more popular than ever, but Biblical scholar N.T. Wright's recent book argues that this cultural conception of heaven has little basis in scripture.\nWe all have rituals for confronting the dark. Here\u2019s what happened when my father met a literal demon.\nMaybe not, but they should offend most passengers.\nAs the U.S. military today begins allowing gay service members to no longer hide their sexuality, we look at the various academic and empirical studies that surround the issue.",

    "text": "Soon after I started my internship at Caster, I realized that all the communications and public relations classes I\u2019d taken didn\u2019t teach me everything that I would come across in a real-world environment. Here I was introduced to new types of projects and industry resources, and one thing I\u2019ve done a lot is create media lists. I didn\u2019t know anything about media lists before being an intern at Caster, and I had never learned how to put one together. My first instinct about media lists was that they were Word documents you created with media sources that pertained to the topic at hand. I had no idea how detailed they needed to be and how much useful information you could actually find. Luckily for me I have a great team that eased me into this process and taught me how to correctly put one together.\nMedia lists are a compilation of names, information and sources that are applicable to campaigns and outreach for media pitching. These names include specific journalists and outlets who have written or currently write about the topic you want to pitch. For example, if you\u2019re looking for coverage about a new tech gadget your client has released, you may want to pitch to those who write for TechCrunch or Engadget, or who covered a similar product in the past. The media list will usually consist of the name of a journalist, outlet they write for, email or contact information, Twitter handle and a link to something relevant they\u2019ve written. It has taken me a little while to figure out which targets are good for a certain pitch and should be added to a list. I\u2019ve learned that you want your target to post regularly about the topic you are pitching. If they have only posted about a certain topic once, you\u2019re better off finding something else. If your target has a large following and is a respected outlet in the industry you are working in, that is also a good sign.\nAn important key to compiling a good media list is making sure that all of the information you use is up-to-date. Be sure that the journalist you include is still working for the outlet and writing about topics that are in your area of interest. Another important detail to watch out for is the journalists\u2019 email address, since addresses that are news@site.com and info@company.net are just for general use and are ineffective for pitching. A resource that we use to find this information is Meltwater, which has a search function where you can look for a journalists. If they are in the system, Meltwater provides you with updated information for that journalist. If someone you are looking for is not in Meltwater you must search through the web. I suggest Googling their name and checking Twitter, LinkedIn and their personal sites for contact information.\nMedia lists are a crucial part of pitching to help your clients to get coverage. As I keep working on media lists, I become better and better. It has become a lot easier for me to spot good targets and I have even begun to recognize big names in the tech-writing business. It\u2019s a great feeling knowing that your research is being used in an effective way to help get client coverage. Keep in mind the tips and tricks I shared above from my personal experience and let me know what you think by connecting with me on Twitter @AliCerasuolo!",

    "text": "This is the second installment of author Ted Scofield\u2019s series on \u201ceverybody else\u2019s biggest problem.\u201d If you missed his introduction to the series, you can read it here. New installments will be posted every two weeks, on Tuesdays.\nGreed is an important underlying theme of my novel, Eat What You Kill, and while researching it I stumbled upon two fascinating data sets which launched me on this quest to define greed.\n\u201cGreed undoes family and community ties and undermines the very values on which society and civilization are founded,\u201d a physician counseled in Psychology Today.\n\u201cGreed is more than simple avarice; greed robs and hurts and even kills people,\u201d Pastor Dwayne Westerman argues.\n\u201cYour greed has got to end! Your greed is destroying America, and we are going to end your greed!\u201d Bernie Sanders exclaimed on July 19, 2015, addressing unidentified \u201cbillionaires\u201d who were not present at the time.\n\u201cUnconstrained greed is the heresy of our times \u2026 if it is not restrained, then the consequence could well be the total collapse of the society in which we live,\u201d says British intellectual Stewart Sutherland in his 2014 book Greed.\n\u201cHuman civilization will collapse unless the greed culture is stopped,\u201d The Telegraph proclaimed.\n\u201cGreed, in particular the greed of corporations and billionaire oligarchs, is driving human civilization and the biosphere towards disaster,\u201d we read recently.\nOkay, so the politicians, pundits and preachers tell us that greed is B-A-D. Do we commoners agree? A legion of polls suggests we do.\nZogby recently conducted a large benchmark poll in which respondents identified \u201cgreed/materialism\u201d as the number one \u201cmost urgent problem in American culture.\u201d Number one! Most urgent! \u201cPoverty/economic justice\u201d finished in second place.\nIn a 2014 Vanity Fair poll, 78% of Americans disagreed with the famous Gordon Gekko quote \u201cGreed is good.\u201d Only 19% agreed. Salon.com recently warned \u201cWall Street greed refuses to die: How lobbyists & dark-money groups are exposing us to another disaster\u201d and we reject greed as an appropriate motivator: A recent Marist poll revealed that 74% of Americans see business decisions based on greed as morally wrong.\nBack in 1992, a national Gallup survey revealed that 75% of Americans believe there is \u201ctoo much emphasis on money\u201d in our nation. A more recent poll of Economist readers asked \u201cWhat is the deadliest sin?\u201d and, yes, greed ranked number one.\nFinally, we seem to have grown weary and dubious of incessant technology \u201cimprovements.\u201d Although Bill Gates once said \u201cMicrosoft is not about greed; it\u2019s about innovation and fairness,\u201d for the first time in fifteen years, a 2015 poll recorded a decline in our faith in the motivation for innovation: 30% said it\u2019s intended to improve people\u2019s lives. Fifty-four percent answered \u201cgreed.\u201d Did you hear that, Apple? I just bought my iPhone 6S; I don\u2019t need an upgrade just yet.\nSo, we agree, greed is a problem in our culture, but it is your problem? Are you greedy?\nMy guess is you\u2019re thinking right now, No, it is not my problem, I am not greedy. Please don\u2019t feel guilty or ashamed if that is your reaction. As Mark Putnam, the President of the Global Ethics University (GEC), says, \u201cAsk anyone the question \u2018Are you greedy?\u2019 and most will deny it.\u201d So, if denial is your first reaction, and it\u2019s definitely mine, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re in good company.\nWhen the BBC conducted a poll on the seven deadly sins (anger, envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride and sloth), greed was last on the list in answer to two questions: Which sin have you ever committed? and Which sin have you committed in the past month? Plenty of Brits copped to being lazy, proud, envious and angry. But greedy? Seventh out of seven, last on the list.\nPolls on societal or collective greed also flip when made personal. For example, in that national Gallup survey where 75% lamented the emphasis on money, a full 80% said owning a beautiful home, a new car and other nice stuff was absolutely essential or important. When asked why they chose their present vocation, the number one answer was \u2026 MONEY.\nYou don\u2019t really want to know about your and my greed.\nIf you have to ask, then this song you really need.\nIt shows up clearly in everybody else.\nLevine argues that greed is dangerous because of \u201cthe link between greed and destructiveness.\u201d Because greed is indeed destructive, our culture must repress it, must change it into an acceptable form. Greed must become something it is not. Greed must be someone else\u2019s problem. Greed must be denied.\nBut could it really be that simple? Are we greedy humans in denial of our own avarice? Is James Patterson, the author who has amassed a net worth of $350 million yet rails against greed, in denial? Is denial why we see it in everyone but ourselves?\nI don\u2019t think so. How can we deny what we cannot define, what we do not, or will not, understand? I have yet to find half a dozen people who can agree on a generally applicable definition of greed. Unlike anger or lust or sloth or envy, greed defies explanation, hence my current quest.\nWhen analyzing this surprisingly mysterious concept, greed, when attempting to reach a standard definition, eight factors emerge, each more enigmatic than the last, and in the next installment we\u2019ll examine the most obvious of the eight.\nUntil then, I\u2019ll give you something to ponder.\nWhat is \u201cabundance\u201d? How much is too much?\nGuilty as charged. I have never thought of myself as greedy but think many other people are, especially in New York. I think (or thought) greed is a massive problem in our culture but not my own. Time to reevaluate. Great piece!\nI hope you will address greed outside of the context of money and material possessions. Can we be greedy in our faith? Can our greed for acknowledgement and attention lead us away from God. Is it greed that possesses us when our time is consumed with a singular motivation? Can greed be good if in fact the entity that is deemed greedy doesn\u2019t hoard but redirects resources it acquires to what it considers its own worthwhile causes, which simply may not be another\u2019s cause but worthwhile nonetheless? Are we greedy if we store grain in anticipation and fear of drought, or greedy if in fact we keep that grain for our progeny because our instincts to protect and provide for our family move within us?\nAre greed and ambition the opposite sides of the same coin ? Or, are they in different domains completely? The human capacity for attribution bias seems to fit this context.",

    "text": "Who really influences K-12 education? There are a host of potential answers; the Department of Education sets national policies, the states set education standards, and your local school board makes decisions around curriculum. This question is also complicated by the financial crises many school districts are suffering.\nSchool districts across the country are having difficulty supplying quality services to their students thanks to these financial difficulties, harming student success in the short and long term. This problem plagues districts nationwide and not a single state or district has been able to completely solve it. In recent years, wealthy individuals have attempted to fill these funding gaps and have become powerful influencers in education themselves. These philanthropists are attempting to use their wealth to advance their conception of \u201cbetter\u201d education.\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into education through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Other philanthropists such as Paul Tudor Jones II, use their resources to expand charter school programs via private foundations. While at first glance these efforts seem as though they are providing great benefit schools and students, there are a number of potential issues to consider.\nInjecting money into schools is not a sure way to create positive change. In 2009, Zuckerberg attempted to funnel more than $100 million into the Newark, New Jersey school system. Governor Chris Christie, then-mayor Cory Booker, and Mark Zuckerberg worked together to create a reform plan. Their efforts were rejected by the community and overall failed to fix the Newark school system. It also lead to a host of firings and school closures, all of which resulted in no significant reforms implemented in Newark schools.\nThe Gates Foundation attempted a similar plan that year in Hillsborough County, Florida, allocating $100 million to boost student performance by increasing educational evaluation measures and rewarding teacher performance. However, six years later, the district\u2019s budget has ballooned to levels they can not handle, creating mixed results in student performance, and prompting the foundation to withhold the last $20 million. Additionally, the Gates Foundation required the county match the $100 million the foundation donated, which further hurt the plan\u2019s chances of success.\nThese philanthropists do not just invest directly in schools, but have also founded or donated to education organizations. These groups can provide needed services to communities where school have fallen short, but schools must be wary of potential pitfalls when they are approached with possible million-dollar donations.\nLarge scale funding efforts like these need smart implementation plans to be effective. However, many districts and organizations are just not equipped to use funds effectively and these extra resources may end up causing more harm than good.\nIn Newark, $50 million was allocated to revamp educator evaluation tools and to fire underperforming teachers, but the district had little ability to do so as the state legislature had set rules around removing teachers. Schools were also closed as a result of this plan, but the district had not set up a good strategy for relocating students to open schools, leading to many students to have to travel long distances through dangerous neighborhoods to get to class.\nHillsborough administrators hoped to use some of the funds to raise salaries for high-performing teachers, while funneling those same educators into high needs schools. Most of this money instead went to longtime teachers, regardless of their effectiveness as educators, who continue to work in stable schools.\nIn both of cases, the vast amount of money that was raised did result significant institutional changes, with hundreds of educators and administrators losing their jobs thanks to curriculum and service changes, and yet students did not end up better off.\nNot all funding comes with no strings attached. Gifts of money can have wide-ranging impacts on policies and organizations. Donors may want to push their own beliefs on what education should be, which may not always be the best for students or a community. Funding often comes with provisions that recipients must follow, giving donors a means of exerting control.\nPhilanthropists aren\u2019t just donating directly to schools, they\u2019re also attempting to change educational politics. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Board of Education elections had its most expensive election ever, with nearly $15 million spent campaigning for board seats. Nearly two-thirds of this money was raised by organizations and individuals supporting new charter schools, which Los Angeles had historically been kept out. Thanks to these efforts, including millions donated by Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, the majority of the LA Board of Education now members support charter schools.\nWe rightly get upset when we hear about billionaires like the Koch Brothers or Warren Buffett who spend millions of dollars to lobby for certain laws and policies, but shouldn\u2019t we also be concerned when equal amount of private funds are invested in schools all while promoting certain programs or viewpoints?\nSupporting education can be a worthwhile project for philanthropists, but organizations and communities need to be cautious about these endeavors. The infrastructure of a district or school may not be robust enough to use this money adequately. Those giving large swaths of their fortunes may have their own personal agendas which they push through these donations. They are not always giving support without ulterior motives.\nWhile more funding can do a lot of good for students and our U.S. schools desperately need the money, the potential hidden costs and negative externalities involved demand debate. Stakeholders must ensure that these efforts actually improve education and that the rich are not using charity to hijack education policy. Districts, schools, and communities must consistently question these philanthropic efforts and work to prevent some of damage to education that have befallen other areas of American policy.\nTucker is a 2019 MPP/MBA Candidate at the Lorry I.

    "text": "The Eurozone economy continues to make headway as the economy in the single bloc currency grew to a 6 year high in February, according to the latest PMI data from IMS Markit released on February 21.\nThe latest data from Markit is flattering.\n\"Job creation was the best seen for nine and a half years, order book growth picked up and business optimism moved higher, all boding well for the recovery to maintain strong momentum in coming months.\"\nGermany and France saw new orders rise at the steepest past since May 2011.\nGermany's upturn was spurred on by manufacturing while France saw the biggest jump in service activity.\nSo the Business optimism detected towards the end of 2016 appears to be now building momentum in early 2017, despite all the political uncertainty in the bloc.\nHowever, political uncertainty in Europe is being played out in the foreign exchange market with the Euro dipping below $1.05.\nIt might be prudent for traders/investors to keep their optimism in check. In a few words, the Euro is likely to face one of its biggest challenges since its conception with the French elections 7 May fast approaching. Should far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen secure election victory traders/investors could be staring down the barrel of a financial apocalypse. Le Pen wants to leave the EU and the Euro. But that might be the catalyst for a financial fusion (meltdown) starting with the almost certain collapse of the Euro, then peripheral spreads blow up, next, the collapse of Deutsche Bank with $46 trillion derivatives exposure. If DB (Europe's largest bank) goes down the drain who will honour its derivative losses (which could amount to $ trillions). Put another way the other banks on the other side (winning side) of DB trades could be left holding worthless paper.\nDB is too big to fail but equally, it's too big to save, even for (cash strapped) governments.\nIn other words, a Le Pen victory could be the financial fusion that blows the collateral chains off the European banking system.\nSo with the stakes so high a rigged French election looks likely, unless the \u201cfixers\u201d are planning a reset and need an excuse.\nNo doubt the secretive Bilderberg Group would be able to write the conclusion, frankly, the rest of us are all left speculating.\nThe EU CPI reading for January is scheduled for toady. Fears of deflation in the eurozone are well behind in the rear mirror and the ECB target of 2% now looks like a reality. The depreciation of the euro and recovery of oil prices could all add to a higher inflation reading.\nIt is an unusual cocktail of optimism, relatively upbeat data mixed with political turmoil. Indeed, Even U.K. Q4 GDP has been revised up to 0.7% from 0.6% preliminary, despite the risk of Brexit.\nAcross the pond, the Trump administration is locked in a bitter fight with Intel, mainstream media and the globalist elites (the shadow government). Nevertheless, household and business optimism remains buoyant. New job creation in the US is an under-reported story.\nThousands of new auto jobs are expected in west Alabama for current and future automotive parts suppliers for companies like Mercedes-Benz US International.\n\u201cThere's a couple of new suppliers building plants just down the street from us. That's going to provide more employment opportunities for the local area,\" according to MBUSI President and CEO Jason Hoff. Those jobs are expected to come available in the next 18 to 24 months.\nThousands of automotive jobs are coming to west Alabama but to get those jobs, you will require technical skill and training.\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement Thursday that the Atlanta-based company is growing its ranks as it expands and upgrades its hubs at several of the nation's airports. Hiring could be contingent on the support of the government in establishing \"a level playing field.\"\nJust a year ago the company laid off 700 workers at the shipyard due to diminishing workload.\nThe shipbuilder is seeing an increase in contracts (business is cyclical) that started end of September, so they are hiring.\nFor the latest job hiring stories (that the mainstream likes to under-report) see the link below.\nIt is still early days to know the full impact of Trump's policies but it's fair to say (remaining apolitical) so far, so good.

    "text": "Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a, S.A. (Iberia Airlines of Spain in English), usually shortened to Iberia, is the largest airline of Spain, based in Madrid.\nThe years following World War I saw a large advancement in aircraft technology with concomitant increase in possibilities for rapid connections between international business concerns. Germany had many business concerns, particularly in Africa and South America, but was still reliant on ships and land routes to reach these. In order to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles stipulation that prohibited German aircraft access to flying over France, agents in Spain explored the possibility an air liaison between Germany and Spain. As such Deutsche Luft Hansa on behalf of German government, established a general agreement with the Spanish government which was signed on December 9, 1927 authorizing an air service between both countries.\nIberia, Compa\u00f1\u00eda A\u00e9rea de Transportes was incorporated on June 28, 1927 with an initial capital investment by the financier Horacio Echeberrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 1.1 million pesetas. The company obtained Government authorisation to establish commercial daily (except Sunday) connections between Madrid and Barcelona. A fleet of three Rohrbach Roland monoplanes were bought in from Deutsche Luft Hansa.\nFlight operations started on December 14, 1927 with inaugural flights aimed to coincide at a commemorative show in Madrid. The opening ceremony at Carabanchel aerodrome was attended by Alfonso XIII and the president of Iberia, Horacio Echeberrieta. The maiden flight from Madrid left on schedule, taking off from Madrid at 12:30 and arriving in Barcelona 3\u00bd hours later. However the Barcelona to Madrid flight was briefly forced to stop in Almaz\u00e1n, Soria due to reduced visibility caused by snow. Although this flight had set off at 9:00, aiming to arrive in Madrid at midday, the delay meant it arrived in Madrid two hours after the dignitaries had already left.\nPassengers in front of an Iberia Breguet 27 Limousine in 1931.\nWithin a year, the company was sponsored by the government to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona. Meanwhile, Deutsche Luft Hansa was favourably rewarded for the 24% investment in the Iberia company when it was granted the regular service between Germany and Spain. On January 5, 1928 the route Barcelona \u2013 Marseilles \u2013 Geneva \u2013 Z\u00fcrich \u2013 Stuttgart \u2013 Leipzig/Halle \u2013 Erfurt \u2013 Berlin was initiated. In July 1928, a twin-engined Dornier Wal was added to the fleet. This seaplane was used on a pioneering route between C\u00e1diz and the Canary Islands. This was used to test the viability of a postal route to South America, by extending the route via Cape Verde Islands.\nDuring the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, it was proposed that the aviation companies in Spain should be combined and become state-controlled as a general interest public utility. This came into effect in early 1928. As a consequence, Iberia was merged into Compa\u00f1\u00eda de L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Subvencionadas S.A. (C.L.A.S.S.A.) together with the following other airlines Uni\u00f3n A\u00e9rea Espa\u00f1ola (U.A.E.), Compa\u00f1\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola de Tr\u00e1fico A\u00e9reo (C.E.T.A.) the pilot training company Compa\u00f1\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola de Aviaci\u00f3n (C.E.A.) and the airship line Transa\u00e9rea Col\u00f3n.\nAlthough Iberia ceased activities on 29 May 1929, barely eighteen months after having begun operations, the name \"Iberia\" continued to be registered by Director-General Daniel de Araoz y Ar\u00e9jula. Of all the airlines that formed CLASSA, Iberia would be the only one to keep in existence after the merger.\nFollowing the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 the LAPE (L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas) company, the airline that would replace CLASSA, became established. LAPE began operations in April 1932, CLASSA flying under the Spanish Republican Flag for one year.\nLAPE operated even during the Spanish Civil War, mainly in its Madrid - Barcelona line, although a great part of the planes of its fleet were requisitioned by the Spanish Republican Air Force and used as military transports.\nAs the name \"Iberia\" was still registered, it was used anew when airline operations began in 1937 in territory held by the rebel faction during the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, after the end of the conflict, the planes belonging to LAPE's fleet were repainted with the Iberia airline livery.\nWhen the Iberia company fully restarted operations following the Civil War, it became a purely domestic airline. It won the right to many of the international routes, such as the service between Madrid and Lisbon; which had been previously established in early 1927 by Uni\u00f3n A\u00e9rea Espa\u00f1ola (U.A.E.).\nInaugural flight to Bata (Ecuatorial Guinea) in 1941.\nOne eighth of the new Iberia's capital investment was offered to Ala Littoria, fascist Italy's airline. After some deliberation, due to its negative experience in investing in the related Corporacion Sud Americana dos Servicios A\u00e9reos, Ala Littoria decided to invest capital in Iberia in the form of two aircraft which were to join Iberia's fleet. The new Iberia's shares were held by the Spanish government (51%) and private investors (49%). Foreign interests could only own up to a maximum of 50% of the 49% of Iberia shares allocated to foreign investment. Ala Littoria purchased three Ju 52 airframes (without engines) from Lufthansa and gave them to Iberia in lieu of capital. The aircraft were put to work initially on the Rome-Venice-Munich-Berlin route.\nThe company still had close ties with Lufthansa, which during World War II caused considerable difficulties to maintain the fleet as the import of fuel and spare parts was infrequent. In addition the Allied Powers refused cooperation with the company until connections with Nazi Germany were severed.\nSource: ICAO Digest of Statistics for 1950-55, IATA World Air Transport Statistics 1960-2000. 1969 RPKs are for the year ended 31 Oct 1969.\nA Sud Aviation Caravelle seen in May 1973.\nAn Iberia McDonnell Douglas DC-10.\nThe airline was nationalised on September 30, 1944, becoming part of INI. In 1946, using the Douglas DC-4 on the Madrid to Montevideo and Buenos Aires route, it became the first airline to fly between Europe and South America after WWII. The lucrative market to South America was helped by the families separated by the Civil War. However, there was intense competition from Air France, KLM and British South American Airways. Since the company was struggling to meet domestic demand, the Government allowed another company, Aviaco, to operate the domestic routes that Iberia did not use from February 18, 1948.\nBy the Pact of Madrid in 1953, visa requirements were eliminated for US visitors to Spain. This stimulated the commencement of transatlantic flights between Spain and United States the following year. In addition, the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on June 14, 1954 were liberal to Spain, allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes. Iberia responded to the increased traffic by acquiring a fleet of Lockheed Super Constellation long range aircraft and these served the routes to North and South America from 1954. The pressurised twin-engined Convair 440 was introduced to the company's European routes from 1957.\nFrom 1961 Iberia had a fleet of Douglas DC-8 four-engined long range jet airliners. The busiest route was Madrid to Buenos Aires. By 1965 a joint board of Iberia and Aviaco was set up to coordinate policies so that services did not conflict. In the early 1970s the company bought Douglas DC-9s and Boeing 747s as it expanded routes to Central America, Warsaw, Athens and Istanbul.\nIn 1974 it launched Europe's first walk-on shuttle service, linking Madrid and Barcelona. That year it established the Serviberia telephone information service, the precursor of today's popular call centres, as well as the 'Red Jackets', uniformed ground staff with the mission of providing special service to customers and to resolve any problems that might arise.\nA Boeing 747-400 in 2006.\nBy the 50th anniversary in 1977 the airline carried over 10 million passengers in a year for the first time. There was fierce internal and political debates over the use of Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s; with the result that Iberia bought Boeing 727s thereby boosting Boeing's flagging production line. However this financial commitment and subsequent failure to anticipate predicted passenger numbers, caused heavy losses for the company during the 1980s. This was especially disappointing in 1982, with the visit of Pope and the football World Cup. By 1987 routes to Tel Aviv, Khartoum, Moscow and Tokyo were added.\nIn the late 1980s/early 1990s Iberia planned a fleet renewal with the McDonnell Douglas MD-87, Airbus A320 and Airbus A340 replacing the Douglas DC-9, Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-10 respectively. A number of Boeing 757s were also bought.\nAt this time Iberia began to build up interests in other Spanish airlines \u2013 Aviaco, Viva Air, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterr\u00e1neo \u2013 and Latin American airlines Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, Viasa and Ladeco. In June 1990 the company led a consortium to buy Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas for an agreed $2billion for 85% stake and the following year bought 45% stake in Viasa for $145million.\nIn 1991 Iberia set up Europe's first international airline frequent-flyer programme, Iberia Plus, and, in 1996, the airline launched the www.iberia.com website. The company ordered 76 aircraft from Airbus in February 1998, which was largest single consignment of Airbus ordered, and bought Aviaco in 1999 and inherited its fleet. This was the start of Iberia's shift from a Boeing/McDonnell Douglas fleet to an Airbus fleet.\nBy this stage privatisation calls from European Union and Spanish Government were being implemented. In December 1999 the company became semi-privatised with shares distributed 40% shareholders, 9% British Airways for \u20ac245million and 1% American Airlines. An initial public offering on October 2000 failed to go ahead, due to internal business difficulties, most notably the failure to offload stock in Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas.\nIberia is an international transportation group, operating in about 100 airports in 40 countries, employing more than 26,000 people.\nIn 2002, Iberia celebrated its 75th anniversary making it one of the oldest airlines in the world. During those 75 years nearly 500 million people have been flown by Iberia, placing the company among the five largest European airlines, and important for routes connecting Spain with Europe and Latin America.\nThe Iberia Group encompasses the Iberia Regional/Air Nostrum franchise. In addition to transporting passengers and freight, Iberia carries out many related activities, such as aircraft maintenance, handling in airports, IT systems, in-flight catering, and holiday packages.\nIberia Group airlines fly to 97 destinations in 40 countries. Via code-sharing arrangements with other companies, it offers flights to another 60 destinations in 25 countries. With a fleet of almost 200 aircraft, it makes about 1,000 flights each day. In 2002, Iberia carried 28 million passengers and 210,000 tons of freight.\nIn addition, Iberia is an aircraft maintenance company, servicing its own fleet and those of another 48 companies, including some European airlines.[which?] Iberia is the main supplier of aircraft handling services at all Spanish airports, with more than 200 airline clients.\nIberia was a founding partner in the computerised air ticket reservation system Amadeus CRS, with an 18.28% stake \u2013 this was sold in 2005. It is also a tour operator through its Viva Tours and Tiempo Libre units, and with Cacesa it supplies package delivery services.\nIberia is allied with American Airlines and British Airways, and on September 1, 1999, joined the Oneworld alliance. British Airways owns 9% of its share capital.\nIn July 2004, Iberia announced it had decided to move its Latin American hub from Miami, Florida to San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Although rumoured plans that the airline was considering to set the hub at Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport were discarded with the announcement, Iberia announced that it plans to expand its Puerto Rican schedules to connect San Juan with Central American cities.\nIn 2005, Iberia introduced its new Business Plus Class, on its Airbus A340 aircraft.\nOn February 5, 2006 the new Terminal 4 at Madrid Barajas was awarded to Iberia and the Oneworld alliance members. This provided expansion capabilities for Iberia. Iberia alone is responsible for around 60% of Madrid Barajas traffic. In 2005 Iberia and its regional branch Air Nostrum transported 21,619,041 passengers to/from Madrid Barajas alone.\nOn November 12, 2009, Iberia Airlines confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with British Airways. The merger between the two carriers will create the world's third-largest airline in terms of revenue. On April 25, 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had agreed to a merger, forming the International Airlines Group, although each airline would continue to operate under its current brand. International Airlines Group, established its head office in London and its registered office in Madrid, operating mainly from its two main hubs of London Heathrow Airport and Madrid Barajas Airport with secondary hubs at London Gatwick Airport and Barcelona El Prat Airport.\nOn December 23, 1948 a Douglas DC-3 crashed in bad weather near Gandesa killing all 27 occupants.\nOn March 5, 1973, 68 people were killed in a mid-air collision above the French city of Nantes involving an Iberia Douglas DC-9 flying from Palma to London as Flight 504; and a Convair 990 Coronado aircraft, operating as Spantax Flight 400. The Spantax Convair 990 was able to make a successful emergency landing whilst the Iberia DC-9 crashed killing everyone on board. The accident occurred during a French air traffic controllers' strike.\nOn December 17, 1973, an Iberia McDonnell Douglas DC-10 registered EC-CBN overran the runway upon landing at Boston Logan after a flight from Madrid Airport. There were no fatalities amongst the 168 people on board, however the aircraft was written off.\nOn February 19, 1985, Iberia Flight 610, a Boeing 727-256 crashed after hitting a television antenna installed on the summit of Monte Oiz while landing in Bilbao, killing 148 people.\nOn July 26, 1996 Iberia Flight 6621, a McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30 flying from Madrid to Havana was hijacked mid-flight. The hijacker, a Lebanese national named Ibrahim Saada demanded the flight be diverted to Miami International Airport. Saada was later apprehended and faced up to 20 years in prison. No one was hurt and the flight later landed at Jose Marti International Airport some hours later.\nOn November 9, 2007 an Iberia Airbus A340-600, registration EC-JOH, was badly damaged after sliding off the runway at Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport. No injuries were reported. According to Airbus, the aircraft was written-off.\n^ Luis Utrilla Navarro & Marcos Garc\u00eda Cruzado (2005).

Around 60 people attended this mid-week event with attendees from a range of industries from software and marketing to communication and other design types.\nTero Hollo started the evening with a longish but engaging revelation of how old memes, ideas and designs periodically resurface and mutate into today\u2019s ideas. We ended his period with a brief discussion and few points about being aware and keeping an eye out for opportunities to recycle nostalgic ideas to entertain and reach your audience.\nThanks for great organization, the opportunity to be part of a group of amazing, talented speakers and for the chance to share with the Ottawa community. The future looks brighter because of events like DesignMeets where sharing brings more inspiration, solutions and opportunities!\nEvening anchor Patty Vargas and official photographer for the event, capped the night recapping her journey that helped create key online photography business models and resources by recognizing and embracing change. Her story of how an Ottawa upstart changed the world of online stock photography by finding their own unique business model shows us how important it is to think differently.\nAfter the presentations wrapped, almost half of us remained to down a few more pints and to conspire on the next event \u2014 always an exciting way to end the night! We discussed the new social thinkspace in Ottawa, Hub Ottawa, and opportunities for growing the design community within our small town. Overall a positive and engaging evening with nuggets of insights and plenty of opportunity for further exploration, we\u2019ll work with our key DesignMeets team and our newest patriots to set another session soon.\nI see design becoming more recognized as an essential component in how we do things. Businesses are beginning to really see the value design can bring to the table and this will only continue to increase. I also see design diffusing into less specialized fields whereby everyone can contribute to design. The role of the designer may change from an actor to more of a facilitator, guiding collective action through a process of researching, understanding, interpreting and re-interpreting problems and opportunities, and generating, realizing and developing design solutions.\nTowards a much more participatory future\u2026 As technology is emerging to facilitate collaboration like never before, design will change to reflect that. Design will evolve from a practice of a handful of people cooped up in an office towards a process that involves communities, populations, and goes straight to the source of the challenges it\u2019s trying to address. Exciting times lie ahead!\nThanks to everyone for a good night! Check out more photos of the event on flickr.",

If you don\u2019t do anything about these opposing forces, they will make a mess of your life and destiny. That is why you can\u2019t afford to miss what am about to share with you on how you can defeat all your enemies including the very stubborn ones.\nLet me start by stating that all it takes to defeat your adversaries have been done by one man and handed down to you if only you will receive it. Every adversity established or manifesting anywhere is pioneered and controlled by Satan. No matter what is opposing you in any area of your life, Satan is at the root of all of it. That is why you must be ready to do as am about to unveil to you.\nThe devil, your one and only enemy who manifests in divers ways and media is an already defeated force. If you don\u2019t know this, you will continue to live in perpetual fear and defeat all your life. Jesus came into the world to destroy every works of the devil (1John 3:8). He disarm the enemy of all his weaponry and made a public show of them triumphing over them in victory (Col 2:15). But all these does not transform into automatic victory for you unless you know and do what it takes to appropriate it.\nI have told you all these to let you know that your adversary is only thriving on your ignorance. And that is the only battle you have to fight right now and each an everyday of your life. You need to fight ignorance because your enemy wants you to always believe he has power over you; that is not true. You can defeat your enemy by changing the way you think. You have made your enemy powerful enough by how you think; it\u2019s time to switch your thinking to the powerful one who overcame for you.\n\u201cThe LORD says, \u201cI am the one who strengthens you. Why should you fear mortals, who are no more enduring than grass? Have you forgotten the LORD who made you, who stretched out the heavens and laid the earth\u2019s foundations? Why should you live in constant fear of the fury of those who oppress you, of those who are ready to destroy you? Their fury can no longer touch you. (Isa 51:12-13 GNB).\nThat\u2019s the good news am sharing with you. God, the creator of heaven and earth has won the battle over your enemy for you. It\u2019s time to start thinking of how big this God is. The more you get conscious of how big your God is, the more irrelevant your enemy will assume. You can arise right now with this understanding and order every stubborn enemy out of your life, health, finances and career in the name of Jesus.\nBut let me warn you; the victory that Jesus won over the devil, your enemy can only be accessible if you are genuinely born again by willingly repenting of all your sins and accepting Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. You don\u2019t have to be defeated another day. Surrender your life to Jesus now by going to Him in prayer and see your enemy crumbling under your feet.\nDefeat, enemy, Gloryland, salvation, thinking like God, Tosin Adeola, True Vine Resource.

    "text": "This is going to sound like a broken record but nothing has changed. We have had a crack of open water about a third of a mile out which extends as far as I can see to the north and south and is at least 25 yards wide for the last two days. Our access is closed to any traffic until we get some COLD weather to close up the whole lake. Until then we just watch the ice pack float around based on the wind direction.\nWe will open the bath house on Friday for people who want to come up for New Year's weekend. You can fish on the south end or hit some smaller lakes close by. Just remember--No Access here this weekend.\nNothing has changed. The cracks have not healed. The lake still has open water so the ice still moves with the wind as evidenced by the hovercraft rescues recently. We need cold weather to freeze everything over. Our access is closed and will be closed through the weekend at least. The lake is not safe near us.\nYou can view our new webcam on the mnlakecams.com website and you should be able to access it soon off our own website. The link should be done soon.\nHappy holidays and wish for cold temps and no significant snow until we are out with fishhouses.\nNot much change. Our access is still closed to all traffic. The winds last Thursday and over the weekend really raised havoc with our ice. I cleared out our main approach where the ice had piled up. The alternate approach still has 6' of ice piled up and we will start on that on Tuesday. The problem is not with the approaches, it is with the cracks and resuting open water. I see a fair amount of open water from shore and I heard of a few problems this weekend with stranded anglers.\nI can tell you straight out that the ice near us is not safe for any travel right now. Most of the ice is 7-8 inches, but there are also open water and spots which have frozen over with skim ice and are not safe. We need some cold weather to freeze up the cracks and open water patches. Also with the open water the ice can and is shifting in the wind.\nWell, where do I start? Monday, I went to the meeting of the Mille Lacs Fishery Input Group with the DNR. They said that the test nets this fall showed a lower number of fish, especially among younger male fish. This is not too surprising considering that is what the Band targets with their nets and also what we target as the fish less than 18\". What is very shocking and quite unexplainable is that the band was 81,000 pounds under their allowable harvest this year and we were 170,000 pounds under our allowable harvest. In fact, in the last 4-5 years the total harvest (Band and sportsmen) is around 400,000 pounds under the allowable harvest. What happened? How can total fish be going down when we have not even been close to what is allowed?\nI think there is still much to be figured out. Are the fish moving to different spots? It would certainly be reasonable considering how popular and successful the deep water, lead core line trollers have been the last few years. Has the zebra mussel growth changed fish location where maybe the DNR test nets are just not catching as many fish? Are the test nets still a valid statistical sample which can be used to estimate the total fish population? Are Band net counters and DNR creel census workers getting an accurate measure of total harvest?\nOne interesting fact from the DNR was that the apparantly lower young male population had not had much effect on fish reproduction. It was still very good with a very healthy young of the year fish population. Maybe the population of male fish is not all that important to the overall health of the total fish population. ( It makes me feel somewhat useless as a male).\nAlso, the lower number of fish caught per test net in Mille Lacs is still higher than in any of the other big walleye lakes in MN. In fact, it was higher than Leech Lake where the DNR reported fish at a \"strong\" level.\nI do not mean this to seem as a condemnation of the DNR. They have a very tough job to do and ,in my opinion, the people responsible for the testing and biology work are dedicated to doing their best in a very tough environment. Having said that, I feel that the numbers they work with are estimates of uncertain accuracy and maybe we are trying to micromanage a huge body of water beyond our capabilities. Because of our agreement with the band, the lower number of fish per test net this year means we do not have the possibility of going over our maximum harvest. If we get close, the DNR will have to change the slot limits.\nThe DNR also said they fear that the fishing will be very good this winter and also next summer. The forage is somewhat lower also so the fish may be biting aggressively. They certainly know how to rain on our parade and make what would be wonderful news any other time seem like bad news. They were trying to warn us or at least make us aware of a potential problem.\nThe walleye regs this winter have not changed. The limit is still 4 walleyes with a protected slot of 18\" to 28\" with one walleye over 28\" allowed. Considering that the fishing was good this summer and very good this fall and we were still 170,000 pounds under our allowable harvest, I am not losing any sleep about regs for next summer. The DNR said the maximum harvest for next year may be around 10% less than in 2011, that still allows a significant harvest for 2012. I say enjoy a very good winter, eat some walleye, and most importantly, HAVE FUN!!!\nOn to ice conditions and fishing. Until thursday, we were enjoying very good fishing and excellant ice conditions. The strong winds yesterday caused many cracks with some ice pile-up and many water spots. Some of the water is around the cracks, but some open water is also present. Adding to this is the fact that it is supposed to warm this weekend . Our access will be closed this entire weekend with no traffic of any kind allowed. We need some cold temps to heal everything up. I wish I had better news.\nSTAY SAFE AND THINK COLD!!!!\nWe have been getting out for 3 days now with ATVs and snowmobiles, as well as walking. The ice is around 7 inches and the fishing has been very good. Most people are fishing along Agate Bay Reef (ABR) in 16 to 25 feet depending on the time of day and cloud cover. I have heard from several groups who have done very well towards sunset along the reef in 20-23 feet, jigging with minnows. Hope to have a webcam installed within a week so watch for that!\nI was out checking ice this morning. There was 5-6 inches of ice all the way to the reef. There were several small cracks which is not uncommon on early ice. By Sat am we should have 6-7 inches if nothing bad happens. At this time, we will be allowing walking and ATV/snowmobile traffic this weekend. HOWEVER, this means one person per ATV or snowmobile with a sled ot tub. It DOES NOT mean an ATV pulling a trailer with people and all their gear riding on it. If you need to pull a lot of weight, the bays down by Isle have more ice and that may be a better bet.\nTHINK COLD AND NO SNOW!!!!!\nBook any house for 24 hours or more for this weekend ( Friday morning till noon Sunday) and get 25% off our regular price. This only applies to new bookings, not houses already reserved. The discount will also apply to our weekend special prices.\nSo if you have waited until the last minute to make plans, jump on this. It is a great price.\nPlease mention the \"LAST MINUTE SPECIAL\" when booking the house.\nHope to see you on the ice!!!!!!\nAfter quite a New Year's weekend, the ice is getting straightened out. We had several cracks when we went from 36 and 1-2 inches of rain to below zero in a couple of days. We moved the main road and bridged the worst of the cracks and this week of cold temps have done wonders to heal the ice.\nThe cold weather slowed the fishing for a few days, but it seems to be picking up again. We saw several nice catches of perch in the last two days and heard of nice walleyes taken also. The deeper perch bite is improving, although they continue to pick some up in shallower areas as well. I think we will see some fishermen leaving the reef areas and start moving deeper along Perch Parkway and south of the reef along either Walleye Drive or Lake St..\nWalleyes continue to like shiners and red hooks are still working. Perch have taken fatheads one day and only wanted wax worms or euralarva the next. Be prepared to offer them a bait buffet and let them show you what they want. The mornings have been better for perch. Walleyes still prefer the low light times.",

    "text": "For video production in general, it\u2019s a huge time-saver. I have several friends along with myself who have been able to develop full course sites of 100+ quality video tutorials thanks to switching from the camera to our iPhones.\nIt\u2019s free and it\u2019s FREEING. Ok, not entirely free but you don\u2019t have to pay anyone every time you need a promo video. There\u2019s no middle man (aka hired videographer) between you and the promo video you want. Not having to depend on someone else or your budget means no limitations on producing video promotion whenever you need it (last-minute sale, launch, etc.).\nMy journey to making all promo/explainer, YouTube, tutorial, and social media videos with my iPhone instead of a professional camera was a gradual one and I\u2019ve learned a lot from my mistakes along the way. Here are my steps (still evolving) on how to make a promo video with your iPhone that\u2019s totally doable while still high quality.\nWill your promo video consist of photos, video clips, graphics designs, or a mixture of the three?\nWill it be text-only or will there be audio as well?\nWhat size works best for your intended purpose and platform? Widescreen or square are your normal options but even vertical is becoming an option with short Instagram Story and Snapchat clips.\nOnce you know what direction your video needs to go in, it\u2019s time to start setting things up for quality iPhone video. Besides lighting, the most important setup piece is your stability. Your iPhone can attach to any type of tripod or stand made for cameras as long you have a smartphone mount.\nI\u2019ve tried many and my favorite right now is the Square Jellyfish mount. It works for horizontal or vertical video and they also have a version for iPads. That link and any other product link here is an Amazon affiliate link meaning I\u2019ll get a small commission if you order. All products are items I have used, but always do your own research.\nEven if you have the latest iPhone, lighting will truly make or break your video quality. There are a million different types of lighting setups out there and your decision largely depends on your budget and what you want to video.\nWindow Lighting. Free and fabulous under the right conditions.\nClamp Lighting. This involves covering clamp lights with parchment paper (to soften the light). I use 3 clamps along with ALZO 27W 5500K Light Bulbs and clip them around my product setup. You can find the clamp lights at your local hardware store or here at Amazon.\nRing Lighting. I love my ring light for talking head clips (when you\u2019re talking to the camera) and it actually doubles for product and tutorial lighting. I have a Diva Ring Light with a bendable gooseneck that allows me to shine its light on my products over a table. Not cheap but very versatile, compact, and little understanding of lighting is needed.\nOne of the easiest ways to help people remember your brand and products is by personally talking to them in your videos. I have found Instagram Stories and Snapchat a great way to practice and get comfortable with this format.\nIf you\u2019re going to speak during your video or record voice-over, quality audio is a must. There are various options but right now I am using the Movo LV1 Lavalier smartphone mic (dongle required for iPhone 7).\nWant background music? The quickest way is to search for royalty free music in the iTunes app. However, I often go to AudioJungle on my laptop to purchase unique royalty-free background music and then I transfer it to my iPhone via my iTunes account.\nI\u2019ve listed this as step #6, but it may be the first step you want to take to make sure you know what you want and need to convey your message in your promo video. I provide a free script writing template in my iPhone Product Video Course (which is also free).\nBe brief. People are bombarded with video now and on average won\u2019t make it through more than 10 seconds of your video. Present your service/product as the solution to their problem and get out of there as quick as possible!\nBe concise. This is where script writing is so important because it helps you craft the perfect message without wasting any extra words that will lose your audience.\nBe engaging. Start with something interesting that has your audience in mind. Don\u2019t start with yourself, start with them.\nAnimated Text Slides. Apps such as iMovie, Quik, & Legend provide this for you.\nRoyalty-Free Stock Photos. Just go to your favorite stock photo website in Safari and you should be able to press and save the photo to your camera roll.\nIf you\u2019ve followed steps 1-7, you should feel fairly prepared at this moment about what clips and photos you need to shoot.\nWipe the lens! It can work magic for a clearer image (a microfiber cloth is great but I usually end up using my shirt).\nUse a stand and smartphone mount (shaky video is the worst!).\nSet the autofocus and exposure by pressing down on the focal point in your iPhone screen.\nAlways do a trial run to make sure everything looks and sounds as you wish.\nAlthough you can create animated text slides in full video-editing apps such as iMovie and Quik, definitely consider using apps such as Adobe Spark Post or Ripl to created isolated animated text slides that can be inserted along with the rest of your footage once you\u2019re in the final video-editing stage.\nThe one piece of all of iPhone video that requires a learning curve is getting comfortable with a full video-editing app. If you\u2019re just beginning, I recommend Adobe Spark Video (not to be confused with Adobe Spark Post) which pretty much guides you through the whole process, Once you get comfortable with video editing, mastering iMovie is essential. In my opinion, it still proves to be the most comprehensive video editor app available. Want something simply and flashy? Try out the Quik app.\nA key to using your iPhone for video editing is being okay with app smashing (using multiple apps to achieve a desired result). For full flexibility and editing, you\u2019ll rarely find it in just one app.\nSounds a little ridiculous but even your marketing video needs marketing. Make a list of all the possible channels you have to share your video and make sure to follow through on that list. Don\u2019t let your hard work go to waste simply because your video did not ever really set sail into the online world.\nIf you\u2019d like a printable guide and video course to help you through the following steps along with lots more details and tips (like a script writing template and more app suggestions), then sign up for my FREE iPhone Product Video Course.\nIn 25 days or less, you\u2019ll have an iPhone promo video that you can be proud of and that will hopefully bring you more sales.\nI hope you found this post helpful and not too overwhelming (remember the free course above will make it even more doable). If you\u2019d like to remember these tips later, be sure to pin the following image to your Pinterest account.",

    "text": "Let\u2019s try again: what happened to the stock market yesterday? We still don\u2019t know, but it appears that something concrete happened against the background of a market that was already tripwire nervous over Greece and the euro and China and whatnot.\nConsidering that the giant decline happened on pretty much *no* volume, I think other factors are at work. I believe the core problem here was a real order imbalance with lots of volume (which took us down the original 350), then nyse halts these stocks, the market orders get rereouted (regnms and all) to ECN\u2019s where there is much less liquidity, and what liquidity is normally there is mostly provided by the nefarious HF strats who were rightly scaling back risk. So the 10K shares that might have been a downtick on nyse blows throught the BATS book completely.\nIn English, this means that when trading started to get too hot and heavy, the New York Stock Exchange stepped in to slow things down. In the old days, this would have worked, but not anymore. Most trading of NYSE stocks doesn\u2019t actually happen on the NYSE anymore, it happens on electronic communication networks (ECNs) like BATS in Kansas City, which is the third-largest stock exchange in the world. So what the algo guy is saying is that when the NYSE tried to slow things down, the computers responsible for program trading just switched their orders over to ECNs. Unfortunately, ECNs are largely used by high-frequency trading shops, and the HFT guys closed up when the market went kablooey. So the ECNs had no buyers, and even a small sell order could blow the doors off a stock price. Which it did.\nI\u2019m very much in favor of this. Maybe someday we\u2019ll understand all this stuff well enough to control it, but right now we don\u2019t seem to. Our financial system really needs a little bit of sand in the gears to bring it back down to human speeds. This would be a good way to do it, and would probably have other benefits too (quite aside from the money it raises). Count me as a fan.",

Those areas also are clickable, but are approximations \u2014 adjacent areas of dark and light blue aren't boundaries, Department of Environmental Quality scientist Al Hindrichs said in an email Friday. For instance, the state says nobody should eat any fish from Capitol Lake in Baton Rouge, while in the Upper Calcasieu Estuary, only crab fat is on the do-not-eat list. For 83 miles along the Tensas River, the advisory states only, \"Long-term fish consumption may cause health risk.\" Most people are advised against eating more than a total of four 8-ounce servings a month of fish caught in state waters, except for king mackerel. At Capitol Lake, it's the manmade chemicals called PCBs . +2 Those are actually exceptions of a sort: nine advisories are for organic compounds of one type or another, while the other 49, including the Gulf waters, are for mercury, Hindrichs said. The Gulf advisory is most likely because the fish are \"highly predatory,\" not because there's more mercury in the ocean, Hindrichs said in an email. Two others \u2014 one for Devil's Swamp, Devil's Swamp Lake and Bayou Baton Rouge, and one for Bayou d'Inde and parts of the Calcasieu Ship Channel \u2014 advise against both eating fish and swimming or touching sediments. \"Do not eat fish or crawfish from this area,\" reads the advisory for Devil's Swamp and related areas.\nAerial of the State Capitol, Capitol Park and Pentagon Barracks in Baton Rouge on Sept. 1, 2015.",

    "text": "HTML5 is one of the fastest evolving web technologies we know, so much so that many web browsers are still trying to catch up to the full feature list of HTML5. We are still experiencing the very early stages of web development, and the capabilities of scripting languages and the browsers themselves. Anyone who has ever worked with a scripting and/or programming language will know the importance of a good editor.\nText editors are very much about usability and flexibility. We don\u2019t want to be writing code in a text editor that does not offer us the freedom to customize and optimize our code in seamless manner. We also don\u2019t want to be working with editors that don\u2019t fully support the syntax of the language we are using, in this case HTML5. With the introduction of HTML5, developers have invested a lot of time putting together and crafting the kind of text editors (for the web) that support native HTML5 language support.\nWe will be taking a look at both code editors, and WYSIWYG type of text editors that we can implement in our websites and projects and use to directly script with HTML5 code from within these text editors. Makes you wonder if WordPress is ever going to advance their content editor to fully support programming languages, a definitive thought for the future.\nIt\u2019s all about rich text editing these days, and the wysihtml5 text editor uses the latest HTML5 features to help developers and webmasters to generate valid HTML5 code output. The wysihtml5 editor is a lightweight solution for generating semantic and valid HTML5 markup; even in cases when content (code) is being copied from external sources. Does not require jQuery to work. Security features ensures that your site is safe and secure, and protected from common attacks like XSS; cross site scripting.\nAloha Editor is a stand alone library with a functional and stateless API that provides you with essential editing capabilities not available in browsers. The lightweight file-size makes Aloha Editor appealing to those are dealing with projects and websites that receive thousands of requests on frequent basis, and you are in full control of how the editor acts in certain situations, there\u2019s an attached API that enables to customize the functionality.\nA built-in preview module lets you see what your code looks like in real-time, saving you a ton of time having to switch back and forth between the browser and the editor; HTMLPad brings the browser to the editor. And on top of all that, all of your code is automatically checked against standard quality, giving you a chance to relax about being compliant with the latest standards for JS, CSS and HTML.\nTinyMCE is a well-known text editor amongst the webmaster and developer communities, and Textbox is a branch of TinyMCE; a powerful text editor for the responsive web, especially mobile devices. Features like seamless inline editing, and in-built spell checking make this particular text editor very appealing to those who are dealing with content heavy sites and need a solution for making editing fun again. It also supports Markdown, and will automatically strip your HTML5 code of any impurities. Works with the most prestigious frameworks and content management platforms on the web: Angular, Drupal, Microsoft, IBM and so many others.\nRedactor II is the number one editor choice for thousands of developers, it must be the framework approach that Redactor Editor takes \u2014 offering more than 200 callbacks and API Methods to support developers and their requirements for a sleek and professional code editor. The Redactor documentation is one of a kind, fully explaining the capabilities and possibilities of the editor, and how more can be achieved without losing resources and time.\nSquire is yet another rich text editor with HTML5 capabilities. It works across all your favorite browsers, yet remains its lightweight features and flexibility. Squire is also popular amongst its users for offering a text editor that supports the crafting of large variety of documents like content, email, snippets, even research papers if necessary. Squire looks to provide a lot of editing capacity without the compromise of performance.\nMercury Editor has been built to help teams, developers and webmasters to have access to an editor that enables for a harmonious content editing experience. The only thing that might scare you away from using Mercury in your next project is the fact that this text editor is based on the Ruby on Rails engine, meaning that only Ruby developers can enjoy access to this wonderful editor.",

    "text": "Music: The priority we live by, but can we afford to use by?\nMusic has been all around us and has made much of style since it\u2019s creation. The indigenous past time went through it\u2019s many incredible cycles. It started with the ominous and vintage vinyl player. That upgraded, eventually, to the casette player. And, as you can guess, that came to the Ipod. And, now the Ipod leads the world in music. But music costs money, and today\u2019s music producers deserve the right to automatically share with their listeners. But what makes this topic so debatable? The fact of the matter is that music producers and artists receiver more money and credit than their audience wishes to pay them. If you look at prices on Itunes, 1.99 may not seem bad for a song, but those prices add up, and as you slowly, or increasingly, make your way up to 100 songs, you\u2019ve wasted 200 bucks. Sorry cash that could have easily made it to a better purchase. Tax hikes recently on music have also brought me to this topic. This heated debate between the consumer and producer have given way to corruption as many fill their hands with more and more cash as prices for songs go up. Spotify recently was filed for tax hike by music producers. That is absolutely insane by my standards as I see paying for the service of listening to my favorite bands an outrage in itself. As a free member, I believe music should be free. The mass market of artists make high above normal, and don\u2019t need the extra green to live. So why price the music? The producers want to earn money, and to do that, they can\u2019t let people listen to the music. They want you to buy the music. Sure it may be their credit, but is a two minute song really worth spending on?\nI love coding and re-visioning the web. Designing it and redesigning it. Pixel by pixel. And technology and news rule my life. Check out my stories here and you shall truly see what I mean.\nFacebook\u2019s IPO: The Killer Company\u2019s Decision That\u2019s Killing Itself.\nI come from a position that once used to be a web for all to share. Copyright content was non talked about, until a resent tragedy that left us all nervous and wallowing in fear. This was the start of an evil opponent to the internet. Many of us take it in some views, and others in another perspective, but I believe this bill should be put to rest. The uprising of many protesters has not been pretty, and more may come if this demon of a bill breaks through this coming Tuesday.\nThis bill, proposed to pass, may, in fact, not be all that it says. It holds truth, also, to cutting off sites IMMEDIATELY. So, say you have a song, maybe on your site. It could be anything infringing. You may not know it, but Comcast could immediately take your site off their IPS. That is incredibly bad in a way that they can actually take you to court. This is an immediate threat that many of us on here have never come to. Having to pay to use pictures, video, or music? That\u2019s insane. Many of you, i\u2019m sure, have heard of Blogger. They\u2019re huge Google company, but SOPA could force them out of business. Blogs currently hosted on there have copyrighted content. So, Google and ISPs would block that. But, I know what you\u2019re thinking. What about my site? If it\u2019s on a domain name, you may be lucky to get the IP address in the box and head to the site while in affect.\nGlobal perspective could bring down the internet usage worldwide. And you may be wondering why? This is because foreign targets are suspected as copyright violators. While you may be able to view your site from that country, if you live there, and it contains copyrighted material, you won\u2019t see it here in the U.S. The bill also puts pressure on ads. Many companies rely on ads, Google being one of them. When ads are taken away, so is that company. And the fact that SOPA is doing this is not going to help anyone in this situation. The ads from the infringing site, global sites included, are found on Google now, they will no longer be found later. This is a big regime to keep the money coming to the media companies. Hey, my blog is awesome, let\u2019s put up an ad. Oh, wait. You have a photo, maybe from Engadget or Huffington Post, on your site. Now, your site is shut down, and no ad for you. This may infuriate users, but I see a globally hacking spree coming. Anonymous, the world-famous group, hacked a few sites recently in opposition of MegaUpload shutting down. FBI arrests of MegaUpload\u2019s founders were made, and not much good will come out. And censored search results will come into play. Money is lost and money is gained, and this will not be an easy task to tackle through.\nSOPA will also make building a startup harder. New regulations put into place will most likely bring less innovation. And less innovation almost falls to a monopoly, or oligarchy of the internet. These rules will weaken the internet indescribably. Say goodbye to Grooveshark and many other free services you use, as building another one will be made even more complicated than the first. Going through domain names is another subject. You may want to go foreign on domains, if SOPA passes, seeing as you may not have copyright issues there.\nMuch has gone through the past 4 months now. Fear and nervousness wretch through your bodies as you anxiously await the gruesome fate of the internet as it lies towards it\u2019s bed of disease. This never-ending virus will push you off from where you started. Anger and rage will soon flourish after this passes (hopefully not). Anonymous has helped by taking sites down today, and many others may be able to bypass SOPA. Other\u2019s will find it difficult and may give up. Vote No at AmericanCensorShip.org, and write to him today. Before the fate of the internet\u2019s hands is left beside the devil himself.\nThe season of giving has headed up so fast, you might not have felt the holidays until now. And the thoughts pile up. What should I buy for the holidays, whether it\u2019s a family member or a friend. But if it\u2019s a tech gift, we\u2019ve got you covered. The many devices emerging this year are great, so for you shop-ahaulics, and you wise money-spenders, we\u2019ve got the list for you. Many tablets and mp3s mare dropping in, plus phones, cameras, and 3d video glasses? Check below and become worry-free with the excellent list.\nThe Kindle Fire seems to be the talk-of-the-town this holiday season, and for many reasons, you can see why. This sleek tablet carries a vibrant 7 inch screen. This is great for viewing HD movies. It\u2019s perfect for most apps, and has a super fast silk browser, cloud support, and more! This is the go-to tablet for last minute shopping.\nNow, if you\u2019re upgrading from point-shoot cameras to mid-dslr range cameras, this one is for you. The $600 price line may shock you, but it pays off in reassurance from it\u2019s magnificence. This amazing little device is the smallest micro four-thirds camera with complete dslr sensor and 1080p video. So, to step up your photo game on a last-minute rush, head to pick up one of these babies!\nFinally, if you\u2019re looking for a great laptop that\u2019s at least 500 bucks cheaper than a macbook, and have money in town pick up this slick beauty. This laptop has great strength with overall fantastic graphic and performance quality, great for work, and free time roaming.\nThis concludes our overview of some last minute holiday gifts. If you wish to include some more items, please comment, and tell us.\nMinecraft: A Game Of Excellence. A Game Of Legendary Status.\nMinecraft has reached millions, and continues to grow. For It\u2019s title, it has reached legendary status. 30 million copies sold and a game of never ending excitement has given the name Indie Game a new name. The popular title started off a mere 2 years ago. The game settled off Stockholm, Sweden, as these developers would release the next biggest Indie Game. Minecraft started as a world. Just a world. To create and edit unique buildings and shapes out of blocks. Updates were made, with many changes. They added day and night and new music. New blocks were also concealed in forthcoming packages. The ability to move blocks and items via redstone was also added. Pistons and coyotes. Ghasts of the underworld. Hundreds, if not more, items have been pushed through this immense process, until today. Minecraft 1.0 officially kicked off yesterday! But while that news may mean nothing, the game officially has no glitches or bugs. Continuous updates of the game will launch, as promised. But more to this package was added that made our mouths water. Minecraft: Pocket Edition. Now, Minecraft for the IOS and Android may seem difficult to play, but Mojang perfected the game, in classic mode, of how platformed-gaming should be done. The easy touch and break blocks and glitchless, for now, has gotten this game ranked #1 in the App Store, although not released until yesterday. With that being said, Minecraft is also launching\u2026for Xbox! That\u2019s right, and the interface seems outstanding. Check out the videos below, and feel free to share your comments.",

    "text": "If you're looking for amazing food in one of Sydney's most iconic locations you really cant go past Preach Cafe. Located on Campbell Parade right opposite Bondi Beach its the perfect place to go if you're wanting to extended your day on after brunch, wether its by doing the coastal walk or strolling through some of the bondi boutiques - theres options for anyone to enjoy a morning out in bondi.\nThe two main dishes that stood out of what we ordered was the Pok\u00e9 cado and the Pancakes.\nThese pancakes are not only the most extra thing you\u2019ve ever seen but they\u2019re also Gluten free and Vegan friendly but don\u2019t get confused by thinking that makes them healthy because they are accompanied by a huge serve of vegan ice cream and drizzled in a shot of maple syrup. I am a huge pancake fan and these definitely cured my pancake cravings, they\u2019re big fluffly panckaes, covered in fresh fruit and maple syrup - they are a huge serve also so make sure you bring someone along to help you finish them!\nThe other dish that ill defeitenly be keen to go back for was the pok\u00e9 cado. The only way I can describe this dish is that its kind of like getting avocado on toast with a side of salmon but with an added flare of a pok\u00e9 bowl in terms of its presentation and texture. The avocado and salmon are diced instead of smashed and garnished with pomegranate seeds BUT there is also diced mango which just changes the dynamics of the dish all together. It may not be for everyone, but don\u2019t turn your nose up until you try it\u2026. It was different, but in the best way.\nOne other positive that we had from Preach cafe was that they make a very decent coffee. Preach cafe uses good quality milk alternatives which makes such a difference when you have a coffee with almond or soy milk. Ill definitely be keeping them in mind as a good take away coffee spot also for the next time I head down to bondi beach for the coastal walk - it was that good.",

    "text": "Horse racing was an especially popular sport with royalty, the aristocracy and the gentry during the eighteenth century. Its origins go back well beyond that time, though earlier races tended to be simple challenges between two riders and their horses. James I began racing his horses for fun by 1605, choosing the obscure Cambridgeshire village of Newmarket to do so. He spent so much time on the sport that parliament had to petition him to give greater attention to the business of state. Where royalty led, the aristocracy were never far behind, especially in matters of pleasure and gambling.\nBy the reign of Charles I, regular race meetings were being held at Newmarket, as well as elsewhere in the country. Cromwell suppressed public races and the gambling that went with them. Charles II, naturally, brought them back and became a devotee. He even took part as a jockey. At the start of the eighteenth century, Queen Anne kept many horses and encouraged the establishment of regular racing at Ascot.\nIt was in the mid-eighteenth century that racing assumed its modern form. Several of today\u2019s \u2018classic\u2019 races were first run then, such as the Derby, the Oaks and the St. Leger.\nHowever, this post is concerned with later developments and how they affected Norfolk. It was in the mid-eighteenth century that racing assumed its modern form. Several of today\u2019s \u2018classic\u2019 races were first run then, such as the Derby, the Oaks and the St. Leger. The Jockey Club was also established (in 1750) to regulate the sport and establish codified rules to govern how it should be organised. As was the system of handicapping still in use today. By 1762, certain horse owners were officially able to register their jockeys\u2019 racing colours or \u2018silks\u2019.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that the original list contained no less than seven dukes, one marquis, four earls, one viscount, one lord, two baronets and only three plain \u2018misters\u2019. If not purely the sport of kings, breeding racehorses was pretty much a preserve of the aristocracy and wealthier gentry. Not really surprising, of course, given the huge costs involved in owning and training a string of suitable thoroughbreds. Gambling, naturally, was open to anyone with money and nerve enough.\nNowadays, races are held at Great Yarmouth and Fakenham, but in the eighteenth century one of the principal meetings took place just outside the little market town of Holt, on land now occupied by Holt Country Park. This area was then part of a great swathe of heathland that virtually surrounded the town to the east and south \u2014 a stretch deemed largely wasteland, save for a few rabbit warrens and some miserable sheep. Racecourses were often established on such land, because they were thought useless for agriculture, were relatively easy to clear from excessive vegetation and had sandy soils that made good racetracks.\nMr. Bullock\u2019s Bay Gelding, Nimrod, rode by himself.\nCol Townshend\u2019s Chestnut Gelding, Forester, rode by Mr. Walker, was distanced in the first Heat.\nThe Company on the Ground during the whole Time of the Races was very numerous and splendid; there were near a Dozen Coaches and Six, most of the horses Bays or Chestnut, and all with grand Equipages, besides a multitude of Post-Chaises, Coaches and Four, Chariots, Berlins, Phaetons, Chaises, Flys, etc.\nThe Assemblies were very brilliant, and a Subscription was opened for the Next Year\u2019s races at Swaffham.\nOn Wednesday the 17th Inst. Will be run on Holt Race Ground, a Match for One Hundred Guineas between two capital Hunters.\nAfter which Saddles and a Five Pound Cup will be given gratis to be run for by any Horse, Mare, or Gelding, not having won or started for a larger prize.\nEvery Horse, &c. Must be entered at the Bar of the Feathers Inn, Holt, before Ten o\u2019Clock in the Morning of that Day.\nAn ORDINARY at the Feathers.\nHOLT ASSEMBLY will be on Tuesday, the 16th of September next.\nTickets to be had at the Feathers Inn, at 3s 6d each, Tea and Cards included.\nThe RACES the next Day.\nHolt features several times in my books about Dr Adam Bascom. In the eighteenth century it was a rather more important place than it is today, with a regular market for the area round about. It was also the meeting place for the local magistrates and Overseers of the Poor, as well as being the starting point for various coach routes, including Norwich and London.\nInteresting! Do I suspect a real horse race in a future book?\nJust a note of thanks for your books and these delightful insights into the past.\nThanks. I\u2019m glad you like them. Have a great Christmas.",

    "text": "Bishop J. Jon Bruno has won an expensive skirmish in the legal war over a prominent church property in the Diocese of Los Angeles. A California Superior Court judge has nullified a use restriction that barred the use of the property for anything other than a church.\nThe court also ordered the diocese to pay $108,182.51 in attorney fees to the developer who had imposed the use restriction, because an appeals court had rejected the diocese\u2019s claim for slander of title. The diocese had alleged that the developer\u2019s assertion about the use restriction had improperly harmed the value or salability of the property.\nThe ruling is likely to have little practical effect, as Bruno has been forbidden to sell the property by the presiding bishop and by a hearing panel that is weighing disciplinary charges against Bruno in the two-year-old controversy.\nAll this comes as the diocese celebrated the July 8 consecration of Bruno\u2019s eventual successor. The Rt. Rev. John Harvey Taylor was consecrated as bishop coadjutor, with Bruno and Presiding Bishop Michael Curry among the celebrants. Bruno, 70, faces mandatory retirement when he turns 72 late next year.\nWhen the Griffith Company, a major California developer, donated a section of prime Newport Beach real estate to the diocese in 1945, the deed specified that the land could be used \u201cfor church purposes only.\u201d The site was being used by the St. James Mission Church, the congregants of which built a 40,000-square-foot facility there that eventually had 1,500 parishioners.\nThe attempt to enforce the use restriction was part of an effort to block Bruno\u2019s plan, announced in May 2015, to sell the property to a condominium developer for $15 million. That sale later fell through, but Bruno ordered the locks of the property changed on July 29, 2015, and the facility has been vacant ever since.\nThe congregation, which renamed the facility St. James the Great after it was reopened following earlier litigation, is led by the Rev. Canon Cindy Voorhees and has continued to worship in other locations, primarily in the Newport Beach City Hall. The congregation has incorporated as Save Saint James the Great.",

    "text": "As the Fall 2018 semester gets underway, the Office of the Dean of Students reminds all faculty, staff, and employees of our shared mission to serve our students with cura personalis, or care for the whole person. This calling \u2013 one of several hallmarks of a Jesuit education \u2013 means that it is the shared responsibility of our entire community to attend to the entirety of our students\u2019 well-being. Whether you are new to Loyola or a veteran employee, a professor or an administrator, this spirit of concern and attentiveness to the physical, emotional, spiritual, developmental, and other needs of our students is part of what makes Loyola a truly special place.\nAs our new and returning students bring their energy and vibrancy to campus, so do they bring their personal challenges and difficulties. Like all of us, students carry many unseen burdens as they strive for academic excellence. Some have pre-existing mental or physical disabilities; others will face new and unexpected diagnoses during their college years. Others will experience the trauma of gender-based violence, relationship violence, or other threats to their safety and dignity. Others still will face fracturing family structures, the loss of loved ones, unforeseen financial obstacles, or other personal crises during their college experience.\nAs a University, we offer many resources and tools for students to work through these obstacles, but navigating between offices and campuses to access those resources can sometimes be difficult for students \u2013 especially when the issue is especially complex, sensitive, or touches several different areas of a student\u2019s life.\nOfficially launched in the spring of 2015, CARE is short for \u201cCoordinated Assistance and Resource Education,\u201d and is a term that signifies the traditional mission of the DOS to support students when unforeseen obstacles arise. This is the catchall for reporting any student with a complex or particularly sensitive set of difficulties.\nThe Behavioral Concerns Team (\u201cBCT\u201d) serves as the centralized coordinated body for assessment and intervention regarding students exhibiting behaviors that indicate severe distress or danger, or that cause a disturbance in the classroom or community. This interdisciplinary team is coordinated by the DOS, but relies on the expertise and partnership of colleagues in the Wellness Center, Campus Safety, Residence Life, Student Academic Services, and other departments across campus.\nFederal law and Loyola policies prohibit all forms of gender-based discrimination and misconduct, including but not limited to all forms of dating and domestic violence, sexual misconduct, stalking, and harassment. The DOS coordinates the University\u2019s response to such incidents whenever they involve students, with support from the University\u2019s Title IX Coordinator, Senior Vice President Tom Kelly.\nThe DOS manages a limited pool of resources available to students who experience unforeseen financial difficulties during the academic year. Requests for hardship funds are considered on a case by case basis. Funds will not be applied to tuition costs or used as a substitute for financial aid; rather, they are best suited for one-time expenses.\nAs the academic year continues, the DOS invites all campus partners to refer or report any students who may be in need of support. By working together in the spirit of cura personalis, we can provide our students the best chance for personal and academic success in the year to come.\nFor more information or to refer students for any of the services mentioned above, please select from the toolbar on the left or visit www.luc.edu/dos.",

    "text": "I make tomato jam several ways using variations on the New York Times recipe. I made the recipe as written once, but thought it was far too sweet. I use half the sugar, switched to brown sugar, and quite a bit more lime juice. I sometimes use cinnamon and red pepper flakes, sometimes I add a habanero, but the best, I think, is this one with Jamaica Jerk seasoning mix. It\u2019s a deeper, more earthy flavor.\nDump everything in a heavy medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring steadily. Bring the heat down to a simmer and let it cook down to jam consistency. This will take about an hour to an hour and a half depending on how juicy your tomatoes are. Check on it and give it a little stir about every 15 minutes so it cooks evenly and you don\u2019t let it scorch. Taste about mid-way through and add seasoning to your taste. When it\u2019s cooked down to a jam, let it cool and store it in the fridge. I will keep at the very least a week, more likely two weeks thanks to all the acid in the tomatoes and the limes.\nThere\u2019s nothing like a delicious sandwich for lunch. The trick is to get a good blend of flavor and texture and this sandwich brings everything. There are three ingredients in this sandwich, roast pork, cabbage, and chutney.\nI like to buy the cheapest pork roast, the shoulder or picnic roasts which run about $1.50 per pound. I spread Jamaica Jerk seasoning over the outside of the roast, top, bottom and sides. I roasted for about 40 minutes at 450\u00b0 F. Roasting time depends on the size of the roast, so I always use a meat thermometer, removing the roast from the oven to rest when the thermometer reaches 140\u00b0.\nChutneys are the easiest thing to make. All you do is toss some fruit in with sugar, spices, lots of ginger, and some vinegar or citrus juice, in this case, lime juice. Chop everything up, bring to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for about one to two hours so all the substance is cooked down to a thick liquid. These are ingredients in this chutney. This makes about a cup of chutney.\nJust about any slaw will work, a mix of crunchy cabbage with a dressing of vinegar is all you need.\nI suppose you can use any bread, but I am partial to rye. I spread chutney on one slice and mayonnaise on the other. On the side with mayo, I put the cabbage slaw and I put the pork on the chutney side. I spread a bit more chutney over the pork. This helped hold it all together when I put the pieces together and cut it in half.\nThis is a delicious sandwich with the crunchy freshness of the cabbage with the bit of tang of vinegar and lime. The chutney adds the unctuous sweet and sour. The rye lays down this hearty foundation for the meat and slaw. It\u2019s perfection.\nThe cabbage should be chopped first and left in a colander, salted to bring out the liquid so the slaw does not turn watery. Wring the cabbage out after it has sat for 30-45 minutes. Then add the carrots, onions, and tomatillos. Mix. Add dressing and shake to distribute dressing over the entire slaw. Do not serve for at least 30 minutes so the flavors begin to marry.\nThis is a very light, fresh cole slaw. Despite the Sriracha and the ginger, it is not that hot. It just has a bit of zing. The tomatillos add a tartness that is fabulous and there is the layer of lime that is right there, adding that citrusy note but it not bitter. I chopped everything very small to make it work well on sandwiches or even dropped into a bowl of chili or soup. There is just enough dressing to coat the veggies and soak in a bit, but not enough to leave a layer of liquid in the bottom of the bowl, so it does not saturate the bread and when you saut\u00e9 it with some pasta or rice, it does not add a lot of oil.\nThis is a big batch. It made 4 quarts of cole slaw and I gave half to my best friend who went with me to Harvest Share. However, the thing with cole slaw that does not have a creamy dressing, that has no buttermilk, yogurt, mayo, or sour cream, is that it will last for several days\u2026which means it is there for several meals and there is nothing more versatile.\nEat cole slaw on its own.\nUse cole slaw on a sandwich. instead of lettuce.\nIt\u2019s delicious wth some pulled pork and chili beans on a burrito.\nSaut\u00e9 lightly with some pierogies or pasta.\nThis was another easy to prepare and flavorful salad I made ahead for some company coming over for brunch.\nIn the morning, I added 1 cup of boiling water to 2/3 cup of bulgur in a one quart plastic bowl with a lid. I sealed the lid and left for later. In a few minutes the wheat absorbed all the water and it was ready. I stuck it in the fridge for later when I would mix up the salad.\nI drained a 15 oz can of black beans, rinsing all the liquid off and let them drain in a strainer while I chopped up the veggies.\nI chopped 3 green onions, 1/2 of a red pepper and a bunch of cilantro. I also quartered 8 cherry tomatoes. I mixed them all in with the bulgur, added the beans and 1 cup of corn salsa. I squeeze 2 fresh limes, added a dash of salt and pepper and 1/2 tsp of cumin and it was ready for prime time.\nIt\u2019s a flavor fiesta \u2013 spicy, sweet, crunchy and toothsome. The corn salsa adds just the right amount of heat. This made one quart of salad \u2013 all in the original container \u2013 so it also meant very little cleanup \u2013 a strainer and a knife.\nThis is just a recipe for the Wild Plum Sauce. My best friend made the stir fry that I served over the rice with the sauce and a pork chop.\nShe brought over 2 quarts of wild plums and suggested I come up with a good sauce. I love a challenge and started to work.\nI put 1 TBSP of olive oil in a sauce pan and heated to medium. I chopped on medium yellow onion and saut\u00e9ed them with 2 inches of minced ginger and about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of grated nutmeg. I let the onions cook until tender. Meanwhile I removed the pits from the plums. When the onions were tender, I added the plums and 1/4 cup of white vinegar. I let simmer until the plums broke down into a sauce. I used a potato masher to help it break down some more. Removing from the heat, I squeezed the juice of two fresh limes, added a bit of salt and pepper to taste. Then I added some sriracha to taste. I suppose about two tsps or so. Mileage may vary. If you like it hotter, add more. After it cooled, I pureed to a nice, smooth sauce.\nThis is sweet, sour and spicy \u2013 perfect for meat, for fried wontons and anything that likes a sweet-sour flavor. It\u2019s good with veggies on rice and just about anything.\nI mixed the following ingredients together and put them in an airtight storage container. I let the salsa rest for a few hours, allowing the lime juice, onions and chile flavors to soak into the cherries. This made a quart of fresh salsa. Since it is fresh, not cooked, it will need to be consumed relatively quickly, though all the acid will slow spoilage.\nI served it with a turkey burger for supper and with a bagel for breakfast. I think it would be delicious on grilled chicken breast or pork chops, added to a burrito or on top of a salad.\nThis salad is inspired by Aarti Sequeira\u2019s salad for Food Network, but I have changed it slightly.\nI cut up 1 watermelon and 1 cantaloupe into 1 inch pieces. As I cut them up, I put them into my giant colander inside a large mixing bowl so that the juice dripped into the bowl. While removing the rind from the watermelon, I set it to one side to use for a watermelon chutney. I left the fruit to drain into the bowl for an hour.\nComing back, I poured the melon juice into a glass for a lovely glass of juice. However, I took 2 tbsp of the juice and put it in a small bowl with 1 tbsp of raw buckwheat honey and stirred and stirred and stirred until the honey was blended with the juice. I then juiced two limes into the bowl and 2 generous pinches of sumac. I cleaned and chopped about 1/2 cup of fresh mint and added it to the bowl. I mixed these together and dressed the watermelon. I put it all in a plastic container to marinate a bit.\nWhen serving, I just spooned some salad in the bowl and sprinkled feta on top. I do not mix the feta in with the salad until serving because I don\u2019t want it to soften in the dressing.\nWatermelon is my favorite fruit. I honestly thought nothing could improve on watermelon. Watermelon is so delicious it hardly needs anything to make it better, but the tartness of the sumac and the bright mint and sour lemon and that hearty buckwheat honey are just amazing together and then the bit of feta. There really can be something better than watermelon.",

    "text": "MY HONEST REVIEW OF RODAN AND FIELDS | AND WHY I STILL USE TULA TOO.\nThis post was first published on October 31, 2017. Post has been updated in 2019.\nI remember when my friend from high school got off the train and I saw her skin looking better than it had in all the time I've known her. She told me she had started using Rodan and Fields and was selling it too, so being the supportive friend I am, I had to try it. There are definitely products I can't live without, but there were some I couldn't live with either. There were also some products I was using that just couldn't be replaced by one of the most sought-after products lines out there.\nI'll cut right to the chase and tell you that the Redefine line from Rodan and Fields really does work. I do think you need to use every piece for it to work its magic. My skin is more even-toned than it has ever been in my life. That said, there are some products I didn't think lived up to the hype too.\nI do love the Redefine cleanser, I think it is one of the key pieces to evening out my skin. That said, it did not remove my makeup. This could be a deal-breaker for some of you, and I don't blame you. I'm not much of a double cleansing girl either. Because of this, it was important for me to start double-cleansing, but I needed to find something super gentle so my skin wouldn't get irritated. I found a few alternatives I like much better.\nMost recently I also started using the Colleen Rothschild Cleansing Balm and it has become my holy grail cleanser. It's a one stop shop and makes my skin glow. I don't even need my Clarisonic! Use code SUNSETS20 to save 20% off.\nThis is another one of my favorite R+F products. It has helped my (and Mike's) skin become so much less red over time. I never miss a day without it and I love having it on hand when my allergies flare or when I do any sort of microdermabrasion.\nRecently I was lucky enough to try Tula's Dual-Phase Skin Reviving Treatment Pads. Tula sent them to me and asked me to use them for the first time live on Instastories. I was so excited for a company to allow me to do an honset, in-the-moment review. These claim to be an at home facial for sensitive skin, and knowing my problems with the R+F paste, I thought I'd give it a try. I've used it twice since and both times it gave me the SAME results as R+F, with much less redness. I'm actually going to make a permanent switch. \u200bYou can see a live video of me using them below!\nI acutally didn't like the lash boost. I think I might be the only one on the planet. Did it work? Yes, it did. Did I pay a major price with sandpaper eyes that were puffy and red... oh yes. I opted to discontinue use because it was truly unbearable. I've also used Neulash and had a less severe reaction. That said, since then I've started using castor or argan oil on my lashes and it is doing a nice job.\nI also struggled with the eye cream which made me sad since it is supposed to be a miracle product. It made my eyes burn terribly too. I do find now that I can sometimes use it, if I apply it correctly and put it no where near my eyes. Makes sense no? Luckily I found a few other eye products that I love that don't irritate my eyes at all.\nThis eye cream depuffs my eyes and it is amazing. Even the new R+F eye cream aimed at puffiness hasn't given me as good as a result as this does. Again, I do have sensitive eyes, so many products are just too strong. For moisturizing my eye area, I love the Tula Revitalizing Eye Cream. It makes them so soft and doesn't create the least bit of irritation.\nI also love Josie Maran's Devotion Creamy Argan Milk Eye Serum for when my sensitive eyes need a dose of extra moisture. I LOVE layering this on at night as it can be used on eyelids too. It has never burned or bothered my eyes at all.\nOne of the things I felt was missing from the Redefine line was a plumping of my skin. With Tula's Volume Defense Deep Wrinkle Serum, you see results instantly- your skin wrinkles are less noticeable right away, and I didn't see any of that with Rodan and Fields, until I bought the Active Hydration serum. This products definitely plumps skin, but it is SUPER pricey- especially when I know I can get similar results from both the Tula Volume Defense Deep Wrinkle Serum and the Kefir Moisture Repair Pressed Serum as well.\nI love the results I have gotten with Rodan and Fields but I can't say there haven't been some challenges too. I also know that R+F is an expensive investment, and I like that many of my tried and true Tula products are a great, more budget-friendly option for those who can't afford Rodan and Fields.\nIf you're going to make an investment and don't have sensitive skin, buy the Redefine four piece kit and call it a day. Then supplement with Tula or anything else you think you may need. I love doing this with Tula because it doesn't clash with any of the other products I'm using either.\nSince originally posting this review I have stopped using Rodan and Fields. I've only been using Tula and Colleen Rothschild on my skin. I can't say it is as even overall but it is much less irritated which is worth it to me!\nJust wondering how long the Tula discount code is valid. You listed a couple of different code options sunsets20 and sunsetsholiday20 and neither seem to work. Any ideas? Thanks!\nHi! The Tula codes just changed with November and the new code is SUNSETSHOLIDAY. That one should work throughout the holiday season- let me know if you still have any trouble!\nHey girl! The Redefine Daily Cleansing Mask is NOT meant to remove make-up. It's best to remove make up with a make up removing cleanser or a make up removing wipe.",

    "text": "Recipe: Easter Lamb: a different Raffaello-Strawberry Cake \u2013 Recipes. Simply delicious.\nEaster is this week! It\u2019s not easy to find visually pleasing and tasty food that has an Easter feel to it, so we decided to take a classic and delicious Raffaello-Strawberry Cake and transform it into a cute Easter lamb. \u263a If you\u2019re planning not to concentrate on the Easter Bunny and Easter Eggs theme, but on the original theme here is an easy recipe for something totally yummy: have fun with this Raffaello delight.\nOutside of Easter, the Raffaello-Strawberry Cake in its original form is easy to make and remains just as delicious: a wonderfully creamy dessert and an impressive cake for on the coffee table.\nSeparate the eggs and beat the egg whites with the salt to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl beat together the egg yolks and \u00bd cup of the sugar until foamy. With a spoon, carefully fold the egg whites into the egg yolk foam. Finally, stir in the flour, cornstarch and baking powder, a bit at a time.\nPut 14 of the Raffaello balls aside for the decoration and cut the rest of the balls into small pieces. Wash the strawberries and set about 10 of them aside also for the decoration. Cut the rest of the strawberries into small pieces. Now beat 1 \u00bc cup of the whipping cream together with the vanilla sugar and 3 tsp. granulated sugar until firm peaks form. Carefully mix in the Raffaello and strawberry piece and your filling is ready.\nSpread the Raffaello \u2013 Strawberry Filling onto one of the cake layers and carefully place the other layer on top. Whip the remaining 1 \u00bc cup of whipping cream to firm peaks and cover the cake with it. Roast the grated coconut in a non-stick pan on high heat for about 2 minutes, stirring continuously so they don\u2019t get to brown. Sprinkle the coconut evenly over the whole cake. Place 3 Raffaello balls in the middle of the cake and place the rest evenly around the top edge. Cut the strawberries in half and lay them in between the Raffaello balls.\nFor the Easter Lamb, do the exact same as for the normal cake, just without putting the strawberries on top of the cake. Instead, cover the whole top of the cake with the Raffaello balls. Create the head and ears of the lamb with the marzipan. Have a look at our picture to see the shape of the head and ears and it should be pretty easy to make. Make the eyes with the coffee or chocolate beans and with the end of a tea spoon make the nostril indents. Now just place the head carefully on the cake and voil\u00e0: the cute Easter Lamb is ready. For the final touch, cut the strawberries in half of lengthwise in slices and place them along the bottom edge all the way around the cake. Now your lamb is sitting on a lovely strawberry field.",

    "text": "Alfred Molina is one of the most brilliant actors of our time. The show was well written and wonderfully acted. The show was given no chance. It was at a bad time and half the times it aired it was competing with the world series. Had this show not been canceled so early in it's run, CBS would have had a huge success.\nThe first time I heard about this show was when it was canceled (which was after two episodes). I happened to look it up.\nNetwork idiocy, all the way. This show had one of the best casts a sitcom could ever hope for.\nAlfred Molina is probably Hollywood's most underrated actor. He's been in wide range of projects, good and bad, and he's always been much better than the role demanded, whether playing the effeminate Harvard professor in \"Species\" or the Mexican villain in \"Maverick\" or the nasty Greek lawyer in \"Before and After\". He finally, now, has been given a major role (as Diego Rivera, in \"Frida\") after about 25 years in Hollywood.\nTraylor Howard should be ranked with Renee Zellweger and Julia Roberts for likeable talent, but she keeps getting stuck in failing projects that don't do her any justice. At least she's free, again, to go pursue something else. She should've been given a break-out role five years ago, already.\nThe rest of the \"Bram and Alice\" cast was strong, too, although because I never heard of the show, I never saw it, so I can only guess at the chemistry.\nI've asked around. I don't know *anyone* -- in person or online -- who saw this show or even saw an ad for it. The network simply decided to waste its money and kill the show even before they canceled it. Sheer incompetence, and someone ought to be fired.\nA different, irreverent little show.\nI hadn't been expecting much from this show, but it came on after \"Becker\" so I decided to give it a shot.\nAlice O'Connor, an ambitious young writer, discovers to her shock that her real father is Bram Sheppard, famous writer and a bit of a lech. She moves in with him they try to form a relationship, with Bram's assistant, Paul Newman, offering a slightly more normal perspective on things.\nThe writing is good and very funny; one reaction shot of Bram's made me laugh for minutes. Alfred Molina totally captures Bram, and Traylor Howard does a good job as his slightly irritating daughter Alice. Roger Bart turns in an amusingly understated role as Paul, and Katie Finneran and Michael Rispoli are good stand-outs as Katie the young professional, and Michael the priest-turned-bartender. Whether these two will be recurring roles or not I cannot say, but I sure hope so.\n\"Bram And Alice\" got off to a good start. Let's hope it can sustain this level of comedy and wit.\nThe pitch for this show sounded boring before I ever watched the first episode. Alice is one more sweet, talented girl with low self-esteem looking to have her dreams fulfilled who goes to meet the father she never knew (and never knew she didn't know--that Bram was her father was news to her). The character is a cliche (though a fairly modern one) and a bit of a waste of Traylor Howard's talent. This is her third series in a relatively brief time, which tells us that she is appealing but they're not sure what to do with her. The character of Bram has potential as a laughgetter but I don't really think he has much potential to be sympathetic. I was more interested in his assistant, though the \"same name as a famous person\" gag was pretty much played out by \"The Tony Randall Show\" and \"Busting Loose\" in the Seventies. For \"Bram and Alice\" to work out, they're going to need to bring more meat to the casserole than they have so far.\nI caught the pilot of \"Bram and Alice\" and saw potential in it, but not as a network TV show. Bram is the author of one successful book, being hounded by his publisher to produce a second. He passes his days avoiding the publisher's phone calls and spending his advance money seducing pretty young women writers who come to him seeking advice or an entr\u00e9e into the writing business. Alice is a daughter Bram didn't know he had, from a years-ago indiscretion with her mother, a woman he hardly remembers. Alice wants to be a writer and journeys to meet Dad to establish herself both as his daughter and as a writer.\nFor anyone who remembers NBC's \"Buffalo Bill\" from the mid 1980s, the same principles apply here: unlikeable characters in key roles and abundant cynicism. Of course, the door is open for redemption and unexpected kindness to blossom, but the show would need to have lasted for more than a couple of episodes.\nOn one of the cable networks this show could possibly have survived, even thrived, because its thorny matters of plot and character could have been worked out. On network TV (in this case CBS) \"Bram and Alice\" withered on the vine.\nI seem to recall that James Burroughs directed the premiere episode of \"Bram and Alice\", the only one I saw; Mr. Burroughs' guidance plus the excellent cast made it memorable. But, like the aforementioned \"Buffalo Bill\", \"Bram and Alice\" died prematurely. I can't guess where this show might have gone given a fair chance.\nWhat a fantastic show! I saw the pilot and laughed out-loud! And laughing out-loud for me usually takes smart writing and great delivery by the actors. This show does that and I hope to continue to watch and laugh out-loud.\nThe series is about Alice O'Connor (Howard) wanted to be a writer in New York City and she finds out that her biological father is Bram Shepherd (Molina) a novelist and the show is titled \"Bram and Alice\" from the people of \"Fraiser\".\nThe show stars Alfred Molina as novelist Bram Shepherd with Traylor Howard as Alice O'Connor, with Roger Bart as Paul Newman (now to be confused with the motion picture star) Katie Finnerman as Katie and Michael Rispoli as Michael.\nThe show airs on CBS-TV at 8:30 p.m. Eastern/7:30 p.m. Central on Sunday Nights.\nThe pilot episode is well-written and a cast of talented actors and actress.\nI give the show 9 1/2 out of 10. Great series.\nBefore you watch it, keep in mind that just about everyone in this show is a highly underrated performer that hasn't quite found his or her clique. This show is certainly good enough to deserve at least 3 more seasons, but I predict that it will soon be cancelled.",

    "text": "Autistic young adults -- are we ready for them?\nAutism is the fastest-growing developmental disability in the United States. Those born within the first big wave of diagnosed cases in the United States are now entering adulthood, and it has become a difficult and volatile future. Some will not go to college; others will not be able to get jobs. Many autistic adults will live with their parents for most of their lives and in some cases, only if they get the proper guidance and support, they may find a part-time job.\nThousands of Latinos are part of the generation of young autistic adults. They were diagnosed in the early 1990s. The lack of information, language barriers, and the limited resources available for Spanish-speaking parents makes these young autistic Latinos more prone to difficulties in their transition to adulthood and the potential for independence.\nOur KVEA Telemundo Los Angeles audience is mainly non-English-speaking Hispanics. Due to the majority of these families not having proper support to overcome the challenges for their autistic adult children, they end up misinformed and without help or resources.\nOur 2013 California Endowment Health Journalism project studied in-depth the dark reality, and some of our findings are very concerning. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explained that from 2002 to 2008 the biggest increase in children diagnosed with autism was among Hispanics -- a 110% increase.\nAnother big eye opener was the lack of services for autistic young adults available after graduating high school. We interviewed Professor Paul Shattuck Ph.D. from the University of Washington in St. Louis and his findings are overwhelming. Shattuck notes that approximately 50,000 young adults in the U.S. suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) turned 18 in 2013.\nIn a phone interview he commented about the lack of services offered to autistic young adults after graduating high school.\n46.9% students with autism receive medical services during their high school years. This percentage decrease when they finish high school, at which only 23.5% are left with this service.\n74.6 % of students with autism receive speech therapy during their high school years, which later decreases to only 9.1%, post high school.\nThose numbers are more devastating among non-English-speaking families. Gloria Rodriguez from the organization Parents with Exceptional Kids, explained that over 90% of the families she works with do not speak English. She states that the majority of these families are afraid of law enforcement because of their immigrant status. Some of these parents strongly believe their autistic young adults born in the United States do not have rights.\nWe also interviewed Elizabeth Gomez regarding her 18-year-old son. She shared that the regional center where she lives is not helping her son with any programs. \u201cWe are abandoned; my son should have the same rights like any other human being in this world,\" relates Elizabeth Gomez.\nThis subject is very important for our audience because the majority of non-English-speaking Hispanics are looking for information and guidance in their native language. During our project we were able to connect with various organizations focused on helping Hispanics with autistic children. This project had the capacity of organizing meetings and accomplished a direct connection with dozens of families that are commonly faced with these challenges.\nOne of the most important lessons of this project was discovering help, finding the light at the end of the tunnel. We managed to find two organizations dedicated to improving the lives of these autistic young adults and their loved ones. These organizations are: Parents with Exceptional Kids and Wiley Speech and Language Center.\nParents with Exceptional Kids support parents of autistic children with many services, such designing an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for special needs students. This plan helps parents to involve the entire family into the support structure created for the autistic family member. These services are available in Spanish and are privately held on a one-on-one basis. There is also a monthly support group, which we attended, witnessing the commitment of the participants.\nWiley Speech and Language Center has a program solely dedicated to integrating autistic young adults into society. It teaches them simple life routines like working, providing for themselves and independent living. The program places these autistic young adults in a classroom as their work environment. In these classrooms, autistic young adults care for younger children with autism. Many of these students respond favorably to the program. Some of the autistic young adults in this program expressed the possibility of predicting the behavior of the younger children with autism due to their previous experiences -- something that seems almost impossible for any expert. Sadly this program is one of the few dedicated to integrating these young adults with autism to our everyday lives.\nOne particular challenge in this project is that I have an autistic young adult at home, and it was difficult not to get distracted by my personal experience. My son is soon turning 22, and that is the age when an autistic person no longer qualifies to receive government-funded education -- among other services -- directly from the public school system. His level of autism is at a moderate stage, which is considered not severe enough to get services and participate in special programs. Also, his IQ is not at a level where he can reach adult independence. Because I am able to speak and understand English, I have better access to information and programs than those parents who cannot speak English. Because of the cultural barriers and immigrant status, many Latino parents live in fear and do not engage in any social services. The project was intense and the product was positive, yet cruel for thousands of families and their special-needs children that lack the access to programs that can change the way they live their lives.\nThe reaction from the community to our reporting was very positive. We managed to accomplish various workshops, reunions, and meetings with families and their autistic young adults. The two part story was aired on Telemundo, and also posted on the Telemundo website, NBC-Latino, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\nEngaging our audience was a very important aspect of our project. This was accomplished through a strategy to connect to our Latino community. We skillfully communicated with our audience through social media and informed them about community programs created to support parents and autistic young adults.\nOur project provided comprehensive information on how to deal with the issues facing us. However, we believe this project is not complete. We need to continue with the studies to close the gap between information and the families in need of this valuable information.\nI appreciate your comments and support. Our work to improve the quality of life for young adult autistics is constant and it's possible thanks to all of you.\nThis article enlightened me on Autism. It is well researched and written. It has inspired me to do more research on the subject, which ultimately may get me involved in it.\nI knew you were a great one the first time we spoke.\nThis story was comprehensive and very well done. It was also proactive and encouraging to families. Families are their child's best advocate and knowledge is power. Thank you for using your voice and your personal experience to reach so many. Thank you also for including our center in your story. Great reporting.",

Bend the typical view of your photographs and video to the extreme with the ability to capture a full 180 degree panoramic frame. That fishbowl angle, combined with the impressive 11.8-inch focusing distance, allows an incredible depth of field making the 6.5mm the perfect addition to your bag of tricks.\nHD SUPER MULTI-COATED OPTICS - In order to assist with the common and annoying problem of flare and ghosting, Opteka's Fisheye lens has been coated with a special layer above the optics to reduce this harmful effect. Additionally, a removable petal shaped lens hood is included reducing further the amount of light directly on the lens. This provides a valuable shelter from unwanted light rays helping you to capture ultra clear and vivid images.\nCONSISTENT AND SHARP IMAGES - Because a single aspherical element is utilized in the lens, this helps to reduce aberrations while maintaining a consistent illumination for sharpness around the entire image edge. Because there is so much detail in the frame of the fisheye with its wide angle view, this welcome addition is a helpful tool to create high quality and consistent images every time.\nDURABLE HEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION - With an aluminum alloy lens mount, a super strong connection between lens and camera ensures your Opteka Fisheye will hold up against wear and tear and keep you capturing incredible images for years to come.\nThis is a manual focus lens. You can only use the lens in \"m\" manual exposure mode or \"a\" aperture-priority mode.\nthe opteka 6.5mm f3.5 fisheye lens is an excellent addition to any photographer's collection, giving users the ability to expand their creativity & capture incredible scenes from a truly unique perspective. The special fisheye design allows maximum creative expression.\nthis lens, when used with cameras with an aps-c image sensor, creates images with an expanded perspective, including images with a creatively deformed outlook & a sharp pan focus that extends throughout the entire frame. By offering a 180-degree angle of view, this fisheye lens can be used to create amazing image expressions that cannot be seen by the human eye, such as exaggerated perspective & distortion. The minimum shooting distance (just 12 inches) & large depth of field also provide amazing close-up shots.\nwhile this lens is designed for aps-c sensors, full frame users can now use it without the hood. On aps-c cameras the pictures will fill the entire frame or screen. On full frame cameras the lens will produce pictures with a semi-circular image & close images will appear proportionately large for a dramatic effect.\nopteka's super multi-layer lens coating reduces flare & ghosting, a common problem with digital cameras & also creates an optimum color balance.",

    "text": "Simple. Human nature basicaly likes a mild and tolerant environment.\nSo people who like living in the city must prefer a harsh and intolerant environment?\nI mean really. You are in the same boat as everyone else. You have your preferences and recommendations based on your experiences. When you shoot out beyond that, all you wind up doing is being less helpful to the OP because the board becomes cluttered with your preferences wrapped up in some philosophical sales pitch. Give it a rest, and allow the rest of us to contribute w/o coming under fire.\nSo fine jump in here and tell her where she is going to find a place with a yard for her dog and and a resonable commute to Blue Ash. I can back off. Only have the obligations of the OP in mind. If you all have preferential treatments please jump in here with both feet.\nKoellegirl- you owe it to yourself to look at Wilkens Blvd., 45040.\nGoogle satellite view it, street view it. If you don't like it, you've still done yourself a favor, because you've just completed 50-percent of your search, and then you can haggle out Kenwood and south.\nThat area was built for people like you (and those like you but raising families), and it is all brand new. Tons of complexes.\nPanera, Polo Grill, Abuelo's, Whole Foods Market (cooking classes, nightly get togethers), Red Robin gourmet burgers, on and on, all right next to each other and easy to get to.\nTons of green space for doggie.\nEnough to keep you interested all weekend every weekend, and if not then Kenwood mall 20min drive on weekends, and downtown 30min.\nActually, Brill, this is what she said. Room enough for everyone to make suggestions w/o having someone come along and start bashing other's points of view.\nHonestly, Hyde Park is probably a perfect fit.\n\"Patronizing\"- way to go ninja, great word.\nSimple. Human nature basicaly likes a mild and tolerant environment. That is what you find in Deer Park and Dillonvale, particularly if you find a property where that dog can feel at home. So now you are happy since the dog is happy and you have a short commute to work. Is there more you want in life? If so then venture into the City. Otherwise just be content with your mundane suburban lifestyle enjoying that dog.\nWe had dogs for about 30 years when our kids were growing up. They were great. Now we have had cats for about the last 20 years. They are different but also great. Our current one, Zoey, comes up about 6:00 AM in the morning, jumps up, and lays on me. She will stay there until I get up, go downstairs, and get her a small can of wet food. If the wife gets up earlier and feeds her she is content with that too. But she will still come back upstairs and jump on me until I get up. Pets are great in our lives and great to have around.\nJust find an environment where you and the dog can coexist. It will make your transition to Cincinnati so much easier.\nGreat point Mr. Brill makes about the dog, and he's right that it can destroy your job if you have dog problems.\nUnfortunately he gave it all back and then some with two disturbing statements (1) Is there more you want in life (2) be content with your mundane <whatever>. Very unfortunate offerings indeed. I give him benefit-of-doubt he did not mean it that way. I mean, what 27 yearold professional (or any positive person) wants to hear words like that.\nLast edited by 5thgencincy; 02-26-2013 at 07:45 PM..\nI don't wish to become involved in the tiresome arguments here, but OP, if you were my daughter I'd hope you WOULD have a look at Deer Park and the smaller adjacent subdivision of Dillonvale. Maybe it won't be your cup of tea, but rents should be reasonable and it's safe and convenient to your work. You would need to go elsewhere for your socializing, but you would likely have good neighbors, a real plus being single and in a new town. Please ignore the petty bickering going on here and add these areas to your list to consider.\nHyde Park would be more fun, but it's going to be tougher on your dog and a lot more pricy.\nDillonvale and Deer Park, more affordable, yes. Exciting, NOT, particularly for a professional 20-something single female that wants things to do.\nYou're more likely to find people your own age and interests in Oakley, Hyde Park, Mt. Adams, even Walnut Hills near Eden Park. When the weather is nice, the streets in Walnut Hills around Eden Park are crawling with young single women with dogs! Find yourself a nice apartment in a large Victorian, or sublet a small condo. There are tons of options.\nAs the discussion continues, I'd like to remind everybody to focus on actually trying to help the op, not on winning an argument. Or promoting your agenda. Or posting anything else off topic.\nFrom a driving POV, Deer Park and Dillonvale (in relation to Blue Ash) do make sense, especially since these two adjacent communities offer inexpensive rental and housing options that will appeal to a single female with a dog, who's also seeking convenience and security. Needless to say, if the Dillonvale IGA grocery can't handle the OP's basic food needs, the Taj Mahal Hunt Rd. Blue Ash Kroger store certainly can.\nAnd NOTHING more need be said about fabulous Cincinnati's \"Kenwood Town Center\" (KTC) than what's already been said; KTC's not only Cincinnati's most fabulous shopping destination, it's also one of Ohio's.\nNow here's \"the rub\" (and this is aimed at the OP's ears alone.) Deer Park/Dillonvale, in relation to her job in Blue Ash, are all they are said to be (convenient, affordable, and safe). Yet they are also two of the most bland and unexciting suburbs in the entire Cincinnati metro. No places for a young and single 27-yr. old female (even with a dog), unless she wants to expire with boredom etched all over her face. As already mentioned, the convenience to both job and shopping can't be ignored. But soon enough, the endless treks to that \"wonderful\" Blue Ash Kroger and that \"fantastic\" KTC will wear thin, and this professional 27-yr. old female OP, with her dog, will be screaming to herself: \"Is this ALL there is?\" And my answer would be: \"Absolutely not--the richness of Cincinnati is discovered the more one draws into its center--and we're not talking about convenience nor shopping, but about people and relationships.\" Let's give our OP credit for determining what's the best for her.\nLast edited by motorman; 02-27-2013 at 11:59 AM..",

    "text": "On April 3, 2018, the Superior Court of Washington for King County issued a decision affirming the use of enhanced advance notice bylaws and finding that the board\u2019s decision to reject a deficient notice is an exercise of its business judgment. The case is Blue Lion Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. vs. HomeStreet, Inc., No. 18-2-06791-0 SEA. While this is a Washington state decision, it was widely followed as Delaware courts have not yet addressed the validity of enhanced advance notice bylaws. The case is also a reminder of the importance of well-drafted advance notice bylaws, which can serve as an effective first line of defense to a hostile proxy contest. Likewise, shareholders seeking to nominate candidates should carefully review the target company\u2019s advance notice bylaws to ensure that its notice satisfies every procedural requirement, no matter how trivial.\nHomeStreet is a financial services corporation based in Washington. HomeStreet\u2019s advance notice bylaws require that any notice submission include extensive information regarding the candidate\u2019s background and qualifications, including a 52-page questionnaire, as well as any other information required to be disclosed in a proxy statement by incorporating by reference extensive SEC regulations. Blue Lion Capital (\u201cBLC\u201d), a hedge fund, delivered a 133-page notice the day before the advance notice deadline.\nOn February 23, BLC delivered a notice letter (the \u201cNotice Letter\u201d) to the board\u2014the day before the Company\u2019s advance notice deadline. The Notice Letter informed the board of BLC\u2019s intention to nominate two independent directors, and to submit two substantive corporate governance proposals.\nBLC and HomeStreet both subsequently embarked on public \u201cletter campaigns\u201d to defend their positions. On March 1\u2014six days after receiving BLC\u2019s notice\u2014the board issued a press release announcing that it had rejected BLC\u2019s Notice Letter as invalid. HomeStreet identified \u201cat least 32 instances of failures to satisfy the requirements set forth in the bylaws.\u201d1 For example, the board found that the Notice Letter failed to provide information required under the bylaws by reference to the federal proxy rules, such as BLC\u2019s estimated proxy fight cost and whether BLC planned to seek reimbursement from the Company, and failed to include information regarding share ownership of BLC affiliates. BLC sought to cure the alleged deficiencies in a supplemental submission, which the board rejected as untimely.\nOn March 13, BLC filed a complaint against the Company in Washington state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Notice Letter complied with the Company\u2019s bylaw requirements, and moved to enjoin the Company from rejecting the Notice Letter as invalid. BLC argued that enhanced scrutiny should apply to the board\u2019s decision and that the bylaw should be struck down because it \u201cunduly restrict[s] the stockholder franchise.\u201d Compl., \u00b6 78. On April 3, the court held that the Company\u2019s advance notice bylaw was valid and that BLC had failed to comply with its requirements. The court noted that \u201c[a]dvance notice bylaws like the one at issue in this case are common,\u201d and that the board\u2019s decision to reject the Notice Letter as invalid was subject to the deferential business judgement rule.\n1 HomeStreet Press Release, HomeStreet Discloses That Notice of Director Nominations and Proposals from Blue Lion Capital is Invalid, March 1, 2018, available here.\n2 \u201cNowhere in its objection to BLC\u2019s Notice does HomeStreet claim it has insufficient knowledge of BLC\u2019s intended actions. Instead, HomeStreet\u2019s Board attempts to invalidate the Notice with a novel objection: BLC not only needed to provide the information required (which it did), but BLC also needed to repeat \u201cNo Further Information\u201d or \u201cNot Applicable\u201d more than twenty-five times, to confirm that there was nothing else it needed to disclose.\u201d BLC Press Release, HomeStreet Board Reveals Disdain for Shareholder Rights, March 8, 2018, available here.",

    "text": "It is not a myth! If you buy property in Spain you can get a Spanish residency permit (this is the correct bureaucratic terminology for Spain\u2019s golden visa), which allows you to live in Europe. The only challenge is the paperwork, and you must invest at least 500.000 \u20ac. Keep reading for the details . . .\nIn 2013 Spain passed a law that gives residency permits to non-EU citizens in exchange for a property investment of 500.000 \u20ac or more. The idea is to attract foreign investment and create jobs. This will stimulate the economy and reduce public debt.\nWe have many clients that have taken advantage of Spain\u2019s Golden Visa. In this article we address their most frequently asked questions. We explain the difference between a visa and a residence permit, details about the type of property purchases that qualify, timing and more!\nQ: Can I apply for Spain\u2019s Golden Visa with more than one property if each property is less than 500.000 \u20ac?\nYes. You can use more than one property to qualify for Spain\u2019s Golden Visa as long as the amount invested is equal to or greater than 500.000 \u20ac.\nQ: Is there a certain period in which the purchases must take place? Suppose I buy one property now and another, say, a year later?\nCurrently there are no requirements on the timing of your purchases. The only potential problem would be if the Spanish Government modified the law. Please note that this type of thing has been known to occur. Spanish laws do respond to external factors. For example, the law that created Spain\u2019s Golden Visa was established in 2013. At that time there was a deep economic crisis, caused by the collapse of Spain\u2019s housing bubble. There was a large inventory of unsold properties that were seized, or slated to be seized, by Spanish banks. These weighed heavily on public and private debt. Since domestic housing demand was virtually non-existent, the country did everything it could do encourage foreign investment.\nLike any law, this one could undergo changes. For example, if the government decided it was more interested in infrastructure development, as opposed to selling real estate, it could increase the minimum floor for real estate investment and offer more advantageous programs for infrastructure investment. If this were to happen before you submitted your application, it could be negatively impacted.\nIn our opinion, this law will not suffer important changes in the next five to ten years. However, it is important to know that there is a small chance that the law could change We will tell you why we don\u2019t think it will undergo material changes in coming years.\nQ: Can the law regarding the right to have a Golden Visa be changed retroactively?\nOne of the cornerstones of the Spanish legal system is that laws don\u2019t have retroactive effects. This achieves legal stability with respect to acquired rights. Thus retroactive change is only applied in very exceptional cases.\nQ: How long does Spain\u2019s Golden Visa last?\nPlease note that there are two steps to this process. First you obtain the visa, which is a stamp in your passport issued by a Spanish Consulate. It allows you to travel to Spain, with multiple entries and exits, for one year. Within this year you should travel to Spain and apply for your residency permit. You must apply for this in Spain.\nQ: How long are the residency permits valid?\nResidency permits are initially valid for two years. After this period you can renew it. This renewal is valid for five years. You can continue renewing it every five years as long as you own properties in Spain. You do not have to reside in Spain in order to be allowed to renew your residency permit.\nA: In order to start the Golden Visa/Residency Permit process you must first purchase properties in excess of 500.000 \u20ac. You will need the purchase agreement(s) and the deed(s) to prove that you have made the investment(s). For information on how to obtain your title and other documentation, read 5 steps to take after purchasing property on Costa de Sol.\nA: Once you apply for your residence permit, it takes about 60 days. Roughly 30 days to complete the application process and 30 days to receive your ID card.\nQ: Does the Golden Visa only apply to me or can I extend it to family members?\nA: Spain\u2019s Golden Visa extends to immediate family members. As Spain is one of the best places in the world to raise children, this is an attractive option if you have a family. Spouses and dependent children under the age of eighteen years are guaranteed residency permits. For all other family members you must present paperwork proving they are your legal dependants.\nQ: Can I get a mortgage to purchase my property?\nA: Yes, but it has to be from a foreign bank. The logic is that will bring 500,000 \u20ac of foreign investment into Spain. If you borrow money from a Spanish bank, you are not bringing money into the country. Our recommendation is to either pay in cash, or have your financing lined up before you purchase. Ideally, this will be with a bank you\u2019ve done business with for years.\nQ: If I buy property through a company, can I still get a Golden Visa?\nA: Yes you can. All you have to do is prove that you, directly or indirectly, hold the majority of the voting rights and have the power to appoint or dismiss the majority of the board of directors. This needs to be demonstrated through official documents such as your company\u2019s articles of incorporation. These documents should be notarized and translated into Spanish.\nQ: Are there any scenarios under which the immigration authorities will deny renewing your residence permit?\nBasically there are only two scenarios under Spain\u2019s Golden Visa program where you would be denied renewal. First, if you sell your property or transfer it into someone else\u2019s name. Second, if you have a criminal record. If you have a criminal record you will not receive an initial residency permit.\nWhen you purchase property in excess of 500,000 \u20ac you will receive a multiple entry visa which is valid for one year. Within this year you must go to Spain and apply, in person, for your residency permit. It is valid as long as you keep your Spanish properties in your name. You do not need to reside in Spain, but will have to come here each time you need to renew your residency permit. This is because you have to personally apply for your Spanish ID card.\nIf you decide to live in Spain, you are eligible for permanent residency after 5 years. However, you have to demonstrate that you did not spend more than eleven months outside of Spain within the prior five years. Once you have a permanent residency permit you do not need to renew it. You just renew your ID card which is very fast and easy.\nAs you may heard of, navigating the Spanish bureaucracy can be time consuming, tricky and frustrating! We advice lawyers, who have applied for many Golden Visas and residence permits for our customers and can make the process very easy for you. Given the time and headache the lawyers can save you, we think you will find using their services a very worthwhile investment.\nEs ist kein Geheimnis! Wenn Sie eine Immobilien in Spanien kaufen, k\u00f6nnen Sie eine spanische Aufenthaltserlaubnis bekommen (das ist die genaue b\u00fcrokratische Ausdrucksweise f\u00fcr spanisches Golden Visa), die gleichzeitig erlaubt, dass Sie in Europa leben. Die einzige Herausforderung ist der Papierkram und dass Sie mindestens 500.000 \u20ac investieren m\u00fcssen. Weiter zu den Details\u2026..\nIn 2013 hat Spanien ein Gesetz erlassen, dass einem Nicht-EU-B\u00fcrger die Aufenthaltserlaubnis genehmigt, im Gegenzug f\u00fcr ein Immobilien Investment von 500.000 \u20ac oder mehr. Die Idee ist, ausl\u00e4ndische Investoren ins Land zu bringen und Arbeitspl\u00e4tze zu schaffen. Dies w\u00fcrde die Wirtschaft ankurbeln und die Staatsschulden reduzieren.\nWir haben viele Kunden, die diese M\u00f6glichkeit des Golden Visa in Anspruch genommen haben. In diesem Artikel beantworten wir die von ihnen meist gestellten Fragen. Wir erkl\u00e4ren den Unterschied zwischen Visa und Aufenthaltserlaubnis, \u00fcber die Art des Immobilienerwerbs, die die Aufenthaltsgenehmigung m\u00f6glich macht, sowie den Zeitaufwand und mehr!\nFrage: Kann ich ein spanisches Gold Visa beantragen, wenn ich mehr als eine Immobilie erwerbe, diese aber jeweils unter 500.000 \u20ac kosten?\nJa, Sie k\u00f6nnen mehrere Immobilien erwerben um ein Gold Visa zu beantragen, so lange das Gesamtvolumen des Investments \u00fcber 500.000 \u20ac.\nFrage: Gibt es ein Zeitlimit bis die K\u00e4ufe get\u00e4tigt werden m\u00fcssen? Zum Beispiel, ich kaufe jetzt eine Immobilie und in einem Jahr eine Weitere?\nZur Zeit gibt es keine Bedingungen diesbez\u00fcglich. Das einzige Problem das auftreten kann ist, dass die spanische Regierung das Gesetz \u00e4ndert. Wohlgemerkt k\u00f6nnte dieser Fall eintreten. Das spanische Gesetz reagiert auf externe Faktoren. Zum Beispiel wurde das Gesetz f\u00fcr das Gold Visa in 2013 erlassen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war eine schwere Wirtschaftskrise, die zum spanischen Immobilien-Crash gef\u00fchrt hatte. Es gab einen riesigen Bestand an nicht-verkauften Immobilien die betroffen waren, von Banken \u00fcbernommen zu werden. Dies war schwerwiegend f\u00fcr die staatliche und private Verschuldung. Seit die Nachfrage nach heimischen Wohnimmobilien quasi nicht mehr existent war, hat das Land alles getan, ausl\u00e4ndische Devisen und Investments zu holen.\nWie jedes Gesetz kann sich dieses ebenfalls ver\u00e4ndern. Zum Beispiel, sollte die Regierung entscheiden, dass der Ausbau der Infrastruktur interessanter ist als der Verkauf von Immobilien, dies w\u00fcrde M\u00f6glichkeiten er\u00f6ffnen f\u00fcr Infrastruktur Investitionen. Wenn das stattfindet bevor Sie Ihren Antrag gestellt haben, k\u00f6nnte dies negative Auswirkungen haben.\nUnserer Meinung nach wird es in den n\u00e4chsten 5 bis 10 Jahren keine besonderen \u00c4nderungen geben. Wie auch immer, es ist gut zu wissen, dass es eine geringe Chance gibt, dass sich dieses Gesetz doch \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnte. Wir werden Ihnen sagen, warum wir nicht glauben, dass es massgeblichen \u00c4nderungen geben wird.\nFrage: Kann sich das Gesetz r\u00fcckwirkend \u00e4ndern bez\u00fcglich dem Recht ein Gold Visa zu besitzen?\nEine der Grunds\u00e4tze der spanischen Gesetzgebung ist, dass Gesetzes\u00e4nderungen niemals r\u00fcckwirkend greifen k\u00f6nnen. Das schafft gesetzliche Stabilit\u00e4t betreffend die erlangten Rechte. R\u00fcckwirkende \u00c4nderungen fanden nur in wenigen Ausnahmen statt.\nFrage: Wie lange dauert es ein Gold Visa zu bekommen?\nWohlgemerkt ist das Verfahren in 2 Schritten zu bewerkstelligen. Als Erstes erhalten Sie ein Visa, das ein Eintrag in Ihrem Passdokument sein wird durch ein spanisches Konsulat. Dieses erlaubt Ihnen nach Spanien ein- und auszureisen, so oft Sie m\u00f6chten f\u00fcr den Zeitraum eines Jahres.In dieser Zeit sollten Sie nach Spanien reisen und den Antrag auf Aufenthaltserlaubnis stellen. Der Antrag muss in Spanien gestellt werden.\nFrage: Wie lange ist die Aufenthaltserlaubnis g\u00fcltig?\nDie Aufenthaltserlaubnis ist zuerst f\u00fcr 2 Jahre g\u00fcltig. Danach kann sie f\u00fcr 5 Jahre verl\u00e4ngert werden. Sie k\u00f6nnen anschliessend die Aufenthaltserlaubnis immer wieder um 5 Jahre verl\u00e4ngern, solange Sie Eigent\u00fcmer einer Immobilie in Spanien sind. Sie m\u00fcssen nicht in Spanien bleiben, um eine Verl\u00e4ngerung der Aufenthaltserlaubnis zu erhalten.\nFrage: Wie beginne ich mit dem Antrag?\nUm mit dem Antrag der Aufenthaltserlaubnis/Gold Visa zu beginnen, m\u00fcssen Sie erst einmal eine Immobilie kaufen im Wert von 500.000 \u20ac. Sie brauchen die Kaufurkunde zum Beweis des Investments. Informationen wie man die Kaufurkunde erh\u00e4lt und weiter Dokumente, lesen Sie die 5 Schritte die zu tun sind nach dem Kauf einer Immobilie an der Costa del Sol.\nFrage: Wie lange dauert der Antragsprozedur?\nNachdem Sie den Antrag zur Aufenthaltserlaubnis gestellt haben, dauert es ca. 60 Tage. In etwa 30 Tage um die Antragsprozedur zu vervollst\u00e4ndigen und 30 Tage bis Sie Ihre ID Karte erhalten.\nFrage: Kann nur ich selbst das Gold Visa beantragen oder kann der Antrag auch f\u00fcr Familienmitglieder erweitert werden?\nDas spanische Gold Visa kann sofort auch f\u00fcr Familienmitglieder erweitert werden. Da Spanien eines der besten Pl\u00e4tze auf dieser Welt ist um Kinder gross zu ziehen, ist dies eine attraktive Option wenn Sie eine Familie haben. Ehepartner sowie Kinder unter 18 Jahren erhalten garantiert eine Aufenthaltserlaubnis. F\u00fcr alle weiteren Familienmitglieder m\u00fcssen Dokumente vorgelegt werden, die belegen, dass es gesetzlich anerkannte Angeh\u00f6rige sind.\nFrage: Kann ich eine Finanzierung erhalten f\u00fcr den Kauf der Immobilie?\nJa, aber es muss von einer ausl\u00e4ndischen Bank sein. Logischerweise sollen 500.000 \u20ac an Fremdkapital nach Spanien gebracht werden. Wenn Sie sich Geld einer spanischen Bank leihen, dann bringen Sie kein Geld ins Land. Unser Ratschlag ist entweder die Immobilie mit Eigenkapital zu kaufen oder aber die Finanzierung in Ihrem Land vorab zu regeln. Am Einfachsten wird es sein, die Finanzierung mit einer Bank zu t\u00e4tigen, mit der Sie seit langer Zeit arbeiten.\nFrage: Wenn ich die Immobilie durch eine Gesellschaft kaufen will, kann ich trotzdem das Gold Visa bekommen?\nJa Sie k\u00f6nnen. Sie m\u00fcssen lediglich beweisen, dass Sie direkt oder indirekt Inhaber der Mehrheitsanteile und dass Sie der Bevollm\u00e4chtigte der Gesellschaft sind, der den Vorstand/Administrador benennen und absetzen kann. Dies muss durch offizielle Dokumente belegt werden, wie zum Beispiel eine Gesellschaftsvertrag/Gr\u00fcndungsurkunde. Diese Dokumente m\u00fcssen notariell beglaubigt und ins Spanische \u00fcbersetzt sein.\nFrage: Gibt es irgendwelche Szenarien, die eine Verl\u00e4ngerung der Aufenthaltserlaubnis verhindern k\u00f6nnten?\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich gibt es nur 2 Szenarien des spanischen Gold Visa Programmes, dass die Verl\u00e4ngerung abgelehnt werden w\u00fcrde. Zum Einen, falls Sie Ihre Immobilie verkaufen oder an einen Dritten \u00fcbertragen w\u00fcrden. Zum Anderen, wenn Sie mit einer kriminellen Vergangenheit behaftet w\u00e4ren. In diesem Falle w\u00e4re allerdings bereits der Erstantrag abgelehnt worden.\nWenn Sie eine Immobilie erwerben, die mehr als 500.000 \u20ac kostet, erhalten Sie ein Visa um mehrmalig einreisen zu k\u00f6nnen innerhalb eines Jahres. In diesem Zeitraum m\u00fcssen Sie in Spanien und pers\u00f6nlich den Antrag auf Aufenthaltserlaubnis stellen. Es wir so lange g\u00fcltig sein so lange Sie Ihre Immobilie in Spanien auf ihren Namen behalten. Sie m\u00fcssen nicht in Spanien wohnen bleiben, aber Sie m\u00fcssen jedes Mal, wenn die Aufenthaltserlaubnis verl\u00e4ngert werden soll, pers\u00f6nlich die Verl\u00e4ngerung in Spanien beantragen. Auch deshalb, weil die spanische ID Karte pers\u00f6nlich beantragt werden muss.\nWenn Sie sich entscheiden in Spanien zu leben, sind Sie berechtigt nach 5 Jahren die unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis zu beantragen. Hierzu m\u00fcssen Sie beweisen, dass Sie nicht mehr als 11 Monate ausserhalb Spaniens verbracht haben w\u00e4hrend den ersten 5 Jahren. Wenn Sie dann die unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis erhalten haben, besteht keine Notwendigkeit mehr zu einer Verl\u00e4ngerung. Es muss dann lediglich die ID Karte verl\u00e4ngert werden, das sehr schnell und einfach von statten geht.\nWie Sie sicherlich schon geh\u00f6rt haben, kann es sehr zeitaufwendig, kompliziert und frustrierend sein, sich durch die spanische B\u00fcrokratie zu k\u00e4mpfen! Wir empfehlen Ihnen Anw\u00e4lte, die bereits Antr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr viele Gold Visas und Aufenthaltsgenehmigungen f\u00fcr unsere Kunden gestellt haben. Dies wird f\u00fcr Sie die Prozedur erheblich erleichtern. Die Zeit und die Kopfschmerzen einem Anwalt zu \u00fcberlassen, denken wir, wird sich f\u00fcr Sie als lohnendes Investment erweisen.\nKontaktieren Sie uns gerne um einen Termin zu vereinbaren zur kostenlosen Beratung.",

The lecture was generously sponsored by Fluor Corporation as part of a special Highland Capital Management Warrior and First Responder Reunion event.\nA former sergeant and infantry squad leader, Tiegen applied his military training as a security protection contractor on missions in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. He was an essential part of the rapid response to the terrorist attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, which left four Americans dead.\nTiegen participated in the Center for BrainHealth\u2019s high-performance brain training program after transitioning back to civilian life. He knows firsthand the challenges faced by those who serve our country and communities in high-stakes roles.\nBefore the lecture, warriors and first responders were invited to a special reunion, with food and beverages, live music, and information from the Brain Performance Institute\u2019s Veteran Service Organization (VSO) partners. This event, which was conceptualized by the Brain Performance Institute\u2019s philanthropic partner, Highland Capital Management, aimed to bring awareness to the physical and emotional impact that first responders, law enforcement personnel, military veterans and many others experience.",

    "text": "Multimedia artist Joyce Yu-Jean Lee presented footage of her art installations, which exemplify how visual culture shapes notions of truth and the \u201cother\u201d on Friday, Feb. 16 in Kendall Hall as part of the College\u2019s Brown Bag series.\nLee, who teaches at New Jersey City University and the Fashion Institute of Technology, had no plans to become an artist in her early life. She attended the University of Pennsylvania as a double major in communications and psychology with plans to work in fashion marketing. Two weeks after she returned to school from her summer internship in New York City, some of Penn\u2019s Wharton School of Business alumni who worked at the World Trade Center were killed during the 9/11 attacks. This changed the way Lee saw the world.\n\u201cIf I die tomorrow, with no warning whatsoever, what do I want to be in the middle of doing?\u201d Lee recalled asking herself at the time.\nLee turned to art to process what was happening and make sense of the influx of information and images coming from the media following the 9/11 attacks.\nToday, Lee is highly selective in the way she consumes news. She does not watch or own a television. Lee believes our relationship with the media has a profound impact on the way we understand society and view others.\n\u201cWhile contemporary media washes over us, we can sometimes get lulled to sleep and we don\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening,\u201d Lee said.\nShe encouraged the audience to pause and consider how media influences their perspective of the world around them.\nLee\u2019s recent project, FIREWALL, a pop-up interactive art installation, was displayed at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway. The project compared the disparities of America\u2019s Google search engine to China\u2019s Baidu in an effort to shed insight on how internet censorship produces different results in different countries, and to create discussion about internet rights and freedoms.\nFIREWALL garnered the attention of Chinese authorities when Lu Miaoqing, the only lawyer to win two cases over China\u2019s single child policy, prepared to participate on Lee\u2019s feminist activists panel. The night before the panel, the Chinese government reached out to Miaoqing\u2019s law firm and forbade her to work with Lee or to ever speak publicly again. Miaoqing is now on academic asylum in the U.S.\nLee\u2019s latest exhibit, State of the DysUnion, is on display at NJCU\u2019s Visual Arts Gallery until March 1. This project presents a snapshot of today\u2019s journalism, advertising and the internet influenced by \u201calternative facts\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d discussed in the media.\nThe project is displayed as an eight-foot cylindrical screen.\nThe first chapter shows a variety of news clippings, that include both liberal and conservative articles.\nThe piece rotates front-page international news stories from the day Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election.\nThe next chapter of the installation shows drone footage of the first Women\u2019s March in 2017, from every location around the world, overlaid with footage from this past summer\u2019s California wildfire. The piece showcases the magnitude of the reaction to Trump\u2019s election while the wildfire footage represents how the media builds energy of its own.\nLee uses her art to help figure out how to navigate personal agency in the midst of today\u2019s confusing media landscape.\nIn her 2012 performative activist exhibition, Made in China, at (e)merge Art Fair, Lee dressed up as a Chinese factory worker with a peddler\u2019s cart who created limited edition works of art. Behind her, a screen displayed other factory workers making the products she was selling. This project served as an effort to point at the hypocrisy surrounding the U.S.\u2019 relationship with China and trade.\nLee feels that artists have a specific role in society \u2014 to function as a mouthpiece. They produce works based on the emotions and conditions of the present day, operating as a societal barometer.\nThrough her art, Lee hopes to continue to serve American culture by highlighting important issues that often go undiscussed, and by challenging our country\u2019s standards for communication.",

Some of our team are businesses that we work with every day at Offroad Design, companies like Tom Woods Driveshaft\u2019s, TrailReady wheels, PSC steering, King Shocks and Premier Power Welder have been helping keep our race and trail vehicles at the top of their game for nearly a decade! A little newer to the team but no less important are Amsoil fluids and filters, Lightforce lights, Bighorn Graphics, Nitto Tires and Stage 8 Fasteners. All of these companies are full of people that are great to deal with on an everyday basis and do their best to make our customer\u2019s vehicles and ours own rigs perform their best. Also another important addition for this race was from FOURWHEELER Magazine, Feature Editor Robin Stover. Robin joined our team to cover our effort.\nThe race starting line was in Beatty, it was the normal starting chaos, lots of cars, lots of dust, and we were passing stopped cars and being passed in the first few miles. I can say I was EXTREMELY glad to be driving a 4wd with 37\u2019s on it in the silt and hills, there were stuck vehicles all over and we just drove around everything, the entire race. We were getting behind on checkpoint closing times and had to run super hard to stay in the race and whacked a boulder at high speed and flattened a tire. We lost enough time that we didn\u2019t make the next checkpoint, and were turned back by course officials at mile 215.\nWe started Day 2 and had a pretty good run up to pit 2 where we added fuel. About 10 miles from the finish we saw the 4461 stopped and thought we finally had them but came blazing up to see a BITD race official stopping both of us with a stopwatch. The course was closed to recover another vehicle. They took our times coming in and out and even released us with the same split. We came into the checkers about a minute behind and had no idea who won the day, all we knew was that it was a great afternoon of racing. We didn\u2019t find out that we\u2019d come in first on time till the next morning when we lined up for the start.\nDay 3 started and the shocks did an amazing job soaking up the hits and we drove right on with nothing but speeding hearts and even more respect for the King shock package to show for it. That rocky summit to the finish line was mostly uneventful and we rolled through the hot finish about 45 seconds in front of the 4435. On corrected time they had the day and as the only Ultra4 to finish all 3 days they also took the overall leaving us in 2nd place for the race. We met our team at the finish, did the cool live interview and took off for the hotel in Reno for a hot shower and post race party and a little sleep before the long drive home.",

    "text": "How Long Do I Have to Purchase Car Insurance After Buying a Car?\nCar insurance can be complicated if a person does not have a good agent to help them through the process. How much do you need? When do you need to buy it? Can it be added to an existing policy? This article won\u2019t answer all your questions. It will, however, help answer the question of how soon you need to buy insurance after you purchase a car. The answer can depend on where you purchase your car, your state laws and the existence of any other car insurance policies you may have.\nMany car lots will not even allow you to drive off the lot with a car until you have insurance. This is more to protect them than protect you. They want to make sure the car is covered until it is paid in full. There is also likely to be a requirement as to how much insurance you need.\nA private owner will most likely not care whether you have insurance or not since you will be taking title of the car right away. In this case, you may have two weeks or so, depending on when the temporary tags expire. It is then likely that you will be required to show proof of insurance before you will be issued permanent tags. This is definitely the case in states that require all drivers be covered under some kind of car insurance.\nCar owners who have existing insurance policies will need to talk to their insurance agent. Some policies have a grace period during which the new car is covered under the existing policy. These grace periods vary in terms of their duration, so it is important to carefully review your policy. Other policies do not allow this at all. Your insurance agent can help you determine whether you are covered or not and how long you have before you need to get the additional car covered.\nMost states have some type of car insurance regulations in place and they may differ from the requirements of the dealer where you purchase your car. In all cases, it is better to check in advance with your state Department of Motor Vehicles to find out their requirements. Once you know the State\u2019s requirements, you will be in a better position to comply with them. Unless the dealer requires insurance before allowing you to take possession, state law is the standard, and that will likely mean you need to secure car insurance before you can be issued permanent tags for your car.\nA Business Owner\u2019s Policy (also known as a BOP policy) is a package policy, providing both property and liability coverage geared toward small to mid-size businesses. They are worthwhile because, unlike separate property and liability policies, they are bundled to contain extra coverage at a low price. Many companies now offer specialized BOP policies for home based businesses or specific classes of business, like retail stores and small restaurants. These policies offer more comprehensive coverage to business owners who may not be able to afford purchasing coverage a la carte.\nThe property section of a typical BOP policy will include but is not limited to office equipment, furniture, leased or rented equipment, and property belonging to someone else damaged while in your care. This also includes additions to your building and premises that you rent. When deciding on your limit of property insurance, don\u2019t forget to include the cost of your build-out and improvements, equipment used to maintain the building, and permanently attached fixtures. Always consult your lease agreement, if applicable, so you can include any items you are responsible for and confirm that these items are covered.\nLiability coverage under the BOP policy covers Bodily Injury and Property Damage claims that you are liable for. A claim can be filed against you for medical bills and expenses resulting from injury, sickness or death caused when you act negligently. If not covered correctly, these situations can drain your financial resources and can result in thousands of dollars out of your pocket.\nThe most common example is a slip-and-fall accident. These can result from something as simple as spilled liquids, uneven flooring, or narrow stairs. These accidents account for around 17,000 deaths in the United States each year. They are among the most frequently filed claims against small businesses, making it important to carry liability coverage in the event of such unfortunate accidents.\nSeveral key coverages are not included in the basic policy but may be added to the policy by endorsement. A few of these coverages are Automobile, Disability, Health, Worker\u2019s Compensation and Professional Liability. Each business has different needs, meaning not all of these coverages may apply to you. When buying a BOP policy, carefully review what coverages are included and what are not.\nWorker\u2019s Compensation is required by most states for businesses with more than one employee and you may need to purchase a separate policy for this coverage. Talk to your insurance representative about the Worker\u2019s Compensation laws in your state.\nBuying the right Business Owner\u2019s Policy is a first step in protecting you from the risks inherent to running a business. Carrying this policy may also be a requirement of your rental agreement or leased equipment agreements. By not carrying the right BOP policy, you may be vulnerable to lawsuits or uncovered damages. It is a low cost alternative to out-of-pocket expenses and is packed with coverages which may otherwise be costly.\nRyan Niles is an insurance advisor for NewFirst Insurors, specializing in the development and implementation of risk management strategies for small- to mid-sized businesses in the Texas Coastal region.\nRisk events can come in many different shapes and sizes, but regardless of your profession, risk management is something that can give you the edge over potentially damaging risks. For Small Businesses, there are several reasons why Enterprise Risk Management should be implemented. These reasons range from legal obligations to budgetary requirements and below, we highlight four of the foremost reasons for introducing Enterprise Risk Management to your Business.\nIn large companies, market risk covers the risk that the value of the company\u2019s assets will decrease due to a change in the value of external factors. Changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices can all negatively impact on a company\u2019s assets. Similarly, changing economic and environmental factors can negatively impact on the productivity of small businesses.\nBy monitoring market influences and assessing other external influences that could impinge on the company\u2019s market presence, you can protect against market risks and ensure the productivity of the business. For small businesses, accounting for market risks can help ensure projected growth patterns and prosperity. By formulating an enterprise risk management plan, employers can effectively address and mitigate unfavourable market forces.\nOperational risk represents the risk of loss from failed internal processes. These risks can arise out of everything from poor or inadequate employee practices to hardware malfunction. While operational risk is relevant to all categories of profession, many small businesses often overlook or underestimate the possibility of operational risk-related events damaging their business. Operational risks such as internal and external fraud, employment practices, business continuity processes can all negatively affect the overall business process of a small enterprise.\nThrough in-depth analysis, the identification, measurement, monitoring and managing of operational risk, small businesses can ensure the security and efficiency of the operating process. This involves having well-defined and organized roles, segregating duties and responsibilities, and implementing management review mechanisms that will allow employers to account for operational risks and ensure they don\u2019t threaten the business.\nReputation is one of a business\u2019 most important assets, particularly if they operate globally. That said, reputation is everything for small enterprises and start-ups as it represents the extent to which the company is meeting the expectations of its stakeholders, and this can often prove a determining factor in whether or not a small business can take off. While reputation is one of the most important assets of the business, reputational risks are indelibly difficult to protect against. Factors such as negative publicity, whether accurate or not, can compromise the business\u2019 reputation capital while marketing channels such as social media can carry a lot of risk potential.\nBy defining how you want your business to be perceived, you can begin to clearly identify what risks could negatively impact on the company\u2019s public image. Outlining an enterprise risk management strategy can greatly help a small business to actively monitor the effects of operational incidents on reputation capital and the public perception of the business. This involves an assessment of relationships with consumers, partners and the media as well as assessing the functionality of the business in terms of commitment and quality processes.\nEmerging risk accounts for any new risk that is in the process of being quantified and understood. Emerging risks have the potential to substantially impact on a business or insurance policy and significantly damage the company\u2019s reputation, reach and overall process. Emerging risks can infiltrate any part of your business or personal life and have a huge impact, and unfortunately, as there tends not to be any resolute method of predicting and protecting against emerging risks, they are considered some of the most potentially damaging risks that businesses face.\nTypical emerging risks include Cyber Risks and Social Media Risks, both of which can be reduced greatly through a comprehensive risk management plan, but other emerging risks such as changing economic factors and wholly unpredictable risks like natural disasters can have devastating consequences for unprepared businesses.\nEnterprise Risk Management is all about predicting, preparing for and protecting against the occurrence of a risk event. Each of the risks discussed in this post carry the potential to inflict serious damage on a company\u2019s reputation and overall business process. However, if a small business incorporates each of the aforementioned risks into their overall Enterprise Risk Management plan, they can significantly protect themselves against the possibility of a risk event occurring and devastating the business.\nEnsure your Risk Management Strategy is up to scratch with a free risk assessment.\nLonnie Meadows is a risk advisor for NewFirst Insurors. Lonnie specializes in developing commercial risk management plans for small to mid-sized businesses and focuses on leadership and management relationships to improve his clients\u2019 overall operations.\nAs the U.S. home market slowly recovers, builders are seeing a boost in construction contracts. New commercial buildings are being built at a rapid pace. With these surges in construction, specialized policies like Builder\u2019s Risk provide important protection against exposures that are unique to the building trade.\nThe Builder\u2019s Risk policy provides protection for homes or commercial buildings under construction, while being remodeled, or undergoing renovation. The policy covers materials like concrete, lumber, and fixtures as well as machinery and equipment used to maintain the building. The policy also covers the cost to remove debris caused by a covered accident, like a fire or lightning strike.\nIn most cases, a Builder\u2019s Risk policy is required for buildings under construction and purchased when the home or building is at least 30% complete. The limit of insurance is based on the estimated value of the project once its complete. Because the value will increase as glass, framing, and other materials are added, the limit should also be increased. Once the project is done, coverage will end when the building has been taken over by the owner, the work has been complete for 90 days, or the builder has abandoned the project.\nAccidents happen and by their nature, they\u2019re never anticipated. An accident can stall or completely stop a building project. To avoid the pitfalls of damage, there are three types of perils coverage to choose from: Limited Perils, Specified Perils, or Special Perils.\nEach has their own unique advantages but the most inclusive is Special Peril, which covers accidental losses that are not specifically excluded. While this type of coverage is the most attractive, it is also the most expensive. Though the cost may be more than its counterparts, the broad coverage pays for itself in the event of a large loss that might otherwise have been excluded.\nIt\u2019s a common misconception that all property policies replace damaged items based on their original replacement value. While many companies sell enhanced policies with special endorsements, like Replacement Cost, a great majority of policies come with Actual Cash Value.\nIn the event of covered damage to your property, claims are paid on an Actual Cash Value basis by default. This means only the depreciated cost to repair or replace will be paid. This can leave the project with a shortfall in funds and possibly halt further construction. To avoid this common mistake, check the policy and endorsements to ensure that Replacement Cost coverage is included.\nWhile the coverage provided is vital to most building projects, limitations apply. Builder\u2019s Risk does not cover Earthquake, Flood, Steam Boiler, or intentional acts of damage. Because policies vary by company, coverage for materials in transit, equipment such as scaffolding and trailers, or theft of materials may be limited or excluded. For an additional premium, separate policies or endorsements can be added to ensure coverage is in place where it is needed.",

    "text": "This Americana themed, multipurpose tote is suitable for the pool, the green market, or a fun day trip.\nChoose four strips of fabric from the jelly roll. I used the dark blue paisley, the white and blue tossed plums, the blue with white sprays of flowers, and the dark blue lattice with roses. The fabric width is already 2 \u00bd\u201d, so simply lay out each strip on your cutting board, measure out 2 \u00bd\u201d across the length, and cut away.\nUsing my patterns, cut 12 squares of the dark blue paisley, 12 squares of the white and blue tossed plums, 6 squares of the blue with white sprays of flowers, and 6 squares of the dark blue lattice with roses.\nSew right sides of two squares together using a \u00bc\u201d seam allowance. You can chain piece if you like. Use a dry iron or finger press your seam allowances to the darker side. Keep the layout photo as a handy reminder. Sometimes distractions come up and those tiny squares get jumbled up.\nNow sew the completed set of two squares into blocks of four. Make sure your seams interlock. I rub my fingers together over the joining seam prior to sewing. If they are locked in, you will be able to feel a smooth connection. Gently pull the two pieces apart to see if the join is locked. The locked joins will yield a sharp intersecting point on the face. Again press the seams to one side after finishing.\nJoin the three sets of blocks across into three rows. Press the seams to one side for each row.\nFinally, join the three rows together. It is a good idea to pin the joins for the final row of sewing to keep the intersections aligned.\nVoila! The Front Panel is complete.\nMeasure the length of the left side of your panel (mine was 12 \u00bd\u201d), and cut a solid red strip from the jelly roll the same size. Now cut the strip in half lengthwise. I ended up with two strips measuring 12 \u00bd\u201d x 1 \u00bc\u201d. With right sides together, sew the left and right borders to your panel. Now repeat these steps for the top and bottom borders of your panel.\nRepeat the steps for the front panel to create your back panel. I chose different fabrics, and used the lighter blue paisley, the white and blue tossed miniatures, the light blue and white rose, the lighter blue lattice with roses, and solid cream for the border. Cut 12 squares of the paisley, 12 squares of the miniatures, 6 squares of the roses, and 6 squares of the lattice.\nHere is the layout for the Back Panel.\nMeasure the sides of your front and back panels. They should be approximately the same size, but no worries if they are a bit off, we are going to trim the pieces before construction.\nFor each side, choose four strips of fabric from the jelly roll, and cut to the larger measurement (better too big than too small). The fabrics I chose are pictured. Straight stitch these four strips together to create the side panel. Repeat these steps to create your second side panel. I chose to use the red paisley and the tossed plum on beige for both. The variation is in the colors of the blue and white roses and lattice with roses. In one panel I used the lighter blue and in the other the darker.\nMeasure the bottom of your front and back panels. Choose four strips of fabric, cut to the larger measurement, and straight stitch together. Pictured are my selections.\nWe are going to treat each of the five panels as if they are mini quilts. Cut a piece of the 1 yard of solid navy so that it is 1\u201d larger on all sides of your first panel to be quilted. Then cut a piece of cotton batting the same size. Make a quilt sandwich by positioning your solid navy face down on your mat, followed by the batting and the panel face up. Secure your sandwich with pins. Quilt your panel as you like. I used a simple \u201cstitch in the ditch\u201d approach with each panel. Sandwich and quilt the rest of your panels.\nAfter you finish quilting, trim up each panel. This is the point where you can ensure the pieces are all the same size.\nDecide which edge you would like to be the top of your front, back, and side panels because we are about to give them a nice finish. Measure the top of the panel you are working on and cut a piece of solid navy to fit its width. My first panel measured 13 \u00bd\u201d, so I cut a strip 13 \u00bd\u201d x 2 \u00bd\u201d. Now press that strip in half, and sew the raw edge to the raw edge of the panel like a quilt binding. After adding the binding, turn the strip and hand stitch binding to the back lining. Repeat for the three remaining panels. The bottom panel does not need to be bound because it will be sewn to the body of the tote bag on all four sides.\nCut two strips of solid navy to 21\u201d x 4\u201d. This will yield a handle approximately 8\u201d in height from the top of the bag. Fold each strip in half lengthwise and press. Open up each strip and fold the sides to meet in the middle. The pressed fold will help to gauge the center.\nCut two strips of batting to 21\u201d x 1\u201d and tuck it inside flush against one side. Sew the open side closed. To keep it balanced in appearance, sew another line down the opposite side.\nMeasure 3\u201d from each end of the top front and top back panels. Pin the handle so the end of the handle meets the bottom of the solid border. Make sure the handles are not twisted prior to sewing. Simply hold it up and you will see if it is not correct. Using a \u201cstitch box\u201d, sew each handle to the top of your panel.\nWe are going to put the bag together using a binding to join and hide the exposed seams. Choose eight strips from the jelly roll, or use solid navy if you want the inside of the tote bag to be all one color.\nStart by sewing the front panel to the bottom panel. Measure the edge of the bottom panel lengthwise. Cut a binding strip the measure length by 2 \u00bd\u201d. Press the strip in half. Sew it to the edge of the bottom panel. Place the bottom panel on top of the front panel with the sewn binding on the bottom.\nTurn the two panels over so the lining side of the front panel is now facing you. Reach under and turn the binding around to the lining side of the front panel. Pin the binding to the lining side for sewing.\nSew both pieces together on the lining side. Take your time and make sure you are sewing through both panels.\nWhen you finish and open it up, you will see that the two panels are now joined and the seam is covered by the binding.\nNow assemble the back panel to the bottom using the same procedure.\nPictured is the front panel attached to the bottom with the back panel ready to be assembled.\nNext add the two side panels.\nWe are almost done. Take a breath, you are doing great!\nNow it is time to make this guy into a real tote. In order to sew the side seams to the bottom, twist the side panel and place it on the one side of the bottom panel. Add the binding as you did before. You will be constructing the balance of the seams working in a clockwise fashion.\nAfter all of the pieces are joined with seams your new tote is done. Your tote is completely washable. Since it is quilted, each wash will enhance your design.\nIf you would like your bag to stand up in a more uniform manner, add the seams to the outside of the panels instead of the inside. The photo shows the bag inside out. You will see it stands up proud and tall. By adding the seams to the outside, the bad is able to stand on its own. The seams on the inside give the face side a clean look. You are the designer. It is all up to you.\n1 tote bag. Measures 13\u201dW x 13\u201dH (excluding handles) x 7\u201dD. Machine washable.\nThis entry was posted in Bags and Totes, Jelly Roll and tagged Clermont Farms, Minick and Simpson.",

    "text": "A healthy breakfast is necessary for providing energy and satisfying your appetite. The best breakfast is considered to be the one which combines good carbs and fibres. Here is a list of some best breakfast foods for giving a kick-start to your day.\nCereals are available in many different types. However, the best combination among them can be of whole-grain or bran cereals. They are fortified with a considerable amount of riboflavin and folic acid.\nOats contain beta-glucan which is a type of fiber that helps you to lower cholesterol when the intake is regular. Apart from this, Oats are rich in folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and potassium. To have them in the healthiest way you can simply sweeten your bowl of milk and oats with a bit of honey and some fruit and nuts.\nYou can always choose to sprinkle ground flaxseed while making a smoothie or bowl full of cereal to turn it into a breakfast rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Also, Flaxseed has a nutty flavor and is rich in lignan and fiber. Lignan is an antioxidant which helps you protect against breast cancer.\nIt is a tangy and creamy yogurt which is loaded with plenty of calcium and boasts of protein nearly twice the regular yogurt. You can take it the way you like for providing yourself a healthy and tasty breakfast.\nAs little as two tablespoons can provide about 15% of the necessary vitamin E that is recommended on daily basis. You can eat it simply by combining it with any meal you want, like sprinkling it over the cereal or stirring it into yogurt or mixing it into a smoothie.\nIntake of any fruit is a good option for your breakfast. However, you need to pair them up with other eatables like cereals, eggs, oat meals etc. Among them, cantaloupe contains just 50 calories and complete recommended intake of vitamin C and vitamin A.\nAre you looking forward to losing weight? Then eating half a grapefruit before every meal can help you slim down even faster. Grapefruit is quite hydrating, filling and packed with plenty of immunity-boosting antioxidants. In order to have a complete breakfast, you can pair it with proteins like yogurt or eggs.\nKiwi is a fuzzy little fruit which is considered to have about 65 milligrams of vitamin C per serving. It is considered to be rich in potassium and copper. Kiwis are known to be slightly tart. If you are looking for a sweeter flavor then you can always try to mix them with strawberries or bananas.\nEggs are a part of the healthy source of protein and nutrients intake. However, it has been reported that eggs supply about 60% of cholesterol to your body. Therefore, if overall your diet contains lean proteins and is free of too much of fat then eggs can be great for the morning meal.\nNothing beats banana when it comes to \u201cgrab-and-go\u201d feasibility. For turning it into a complete protein-rich diet you can combine it with cottage cheese and have a whopping 28 grams of protein added to your morning meal.",

    "text": "Automation still mostly threatens those working in low or semi-skilled professions. However, the more digital technology advances, the more high-skilled labor is likely to fall prey to this process. \u201cJobs in transportation, logistics, as well as office and administrative support, are among the most susceptible,\u201d the GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions report by the Citigroup states.\nThe same goes for countries: As the chart below shows, some are more threatened by automation than others. While in the US 47 percent of the workforce is at risk of being replaced by automation, there are far more jobs at stake in China (77 percent) and India (69 percent) whose economies have big manufacturing sectors. And then there is Ethiopia, who leads the list. 85 percent of jobs are at risk there, mostly due to efforts to industrialize the agricultural sector.\nThe good news is that there is still work to go around in professions that are harder to replace by robots and algorithms. Those jobs require creative and social intelligence, including management, business, arts and media, as well as jobs in education and healthcare. \u201cImportantly, the expanding scope of automation is not suggestive of the end of work, as has been proclaimed by several commentators and scholars,\u201d the authors of the Citigroup report conclude.",

    "text": "Any place that sells goods directly to consumers can benefit from the actions of retail associates. These versatile team members do whatever is necessary to promote a positive customer experience, from maintaining an attractive environment to helping shoppers find particular items. Retail associates may work either full- or part-time. Shifts vary considerably since stores are open various days and hours, including evenings and weekends. The variety of hours available to work often attracts college students, parents, and others looking to balance a job with other responsibilities. Many retail associates are hired temporarily during the busy holiday season, and some use it as a path to regular employment.\nWhether stationed at the front of the store or in an individual department, retail associates show shoppers that they are valued by exchanging pleasantries and offering help in finding items.\nRetail associates keep an eye on what is going on both inside and outside of the facility. This may involve noticing a spill and cleaning it up, making sure enough carts are available at the front of the store, or restocking items when a display is low. The presence of retail associates throughout the store also deters theft and vandalism.\nGood retail associates know where items are located within the store. They also should possess knowledge about merchandise within their assigned department so that they can intelligently answer questions from customers.\nWhen customers are ready to pay for their purchases, retail associates perform actions such as scanning items, bagging them, totaling the bill, collecting payment, and issuing a receipt. If someone needs assistance getting a purchase to a vehicle, the retail associate will notify the appropriate staff member.\nEmployers may assign their retail associates common tasks necessary to keep operations flowing and safe. This might involve picking up trash, putting discarded items back in the correct place, restocking shelves, or mopping an entrance way.\nExperienced retail associates may be tasked with getting new hires up to speed and looking over their work.\nRetail associates typically have a high school diploma or are in the process of obtaining one. New hires should expect a period of on-the-job-training where colleagues and managers teach them about store policies, customer service, the location of items, and check-out procedures.\nRetail associates, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) categorizes under \u201cRetail Sales Workers,\u201d are usually paid by the hour. The national median hourly wage is $10.90. Retail associates in the 10th percentile earn about $8.55 per hour, and the highest 10 percent make in excess of $19.90 per hour.\nDepending on where they work, retail associates may get a commission on items they sell. This practice is most common at places where purchases are large, such as at a furniture store. Most retail associates receive discounts on merchandise sold by their employer. Full-time retail associates may be eligible for benefits such as healthcare and paid time off.\nAccording to the BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook, job prospects for retail associates should grow 2 percent between 2016 and 2026. The popularity of online shopping has decreased the number of brick and mortar stores. However, some retailers are upping their game in terms of customer service, which creates jobs for retail associates. And because turnover in this field is high, a good number of openings for retail associates often can be found at any given time.\nIf becoming a retail associate sounds like a great job for you, check out the following resources for further information.",

    "text": "Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick has resigned citing burnout, just six months after taking charge of the Bundesliga club. The 53-year-old suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and has struggled to maintain the energy levels required for the job.\n\u201cAfter a long and deep reflection, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I need a break,\u201d Rangnick said in a statement on the club website.\nPrior to taking the Schalke job, Rangnick had enjoyed a successful four-and-a-half-year spell with Hoffenheim during which he took the club from the third tier to the top-flight.\n\u201cThe decision of Ralf Rangnick deserves the highest respect,\u201d Schalke general manager Horst Heldt said.\nBarcelona and Real Madrid are doing their bit to refute suggestions that Spanish football is turning into a predictable two-horse race. Both sides dropped points last night, with Barcelona fortunate to secure a 2-2 draw at Valencia, while Madrid were held to a goalless draw at Racing Santander. The results leave the reigning champions in 4th spot in La Liga while Jose Mourinho\u2019s Real sit uncomfortably in 7th spot.\nNaturally, Mourinho was magnanimity personified after watching his fail to win or score for the second successive match.\n\u201cIt\u2019s less worrisome to draw a match in which you\u2019re the only side that tries to play and win, said Mr Charm.\nFollowing Sunday\u2019s defeat to Levante, Mourinho complained about the opponents\u2019 underhand tactics. True to form, he levelled the same accusations against Racing.\nBarcelona boss Pep Guardiola has been dragged into the debate concerning the club\u2019s decision to accept a shirt sponsorship deal with the Qatar Foundation. There is a growing opposition to the deal with thousands of Barcelona fans signing an online petition urging the club to revoke the agreement.\nPart of the opposition to the shirt sponsorship deal stems from the lack of democracy in Qatar, but there is also a principle at stake, with may fans believing commercial shirt sponsorship is incompatible with the club\u2019s lofty ideals. A few seasons of mid-table obscurity while they chipped away at their \u20ac442 million debt would certainly test those principles.\nGuardiola, who knows all about the lure of the petrochemical dollar, having played in Qatar for played Qatar\u2019s Al Ahly between 2003 and 2005 and acted as an ambassador for the country\u2019s successful World Cup bid, has defended the regime.\n\u201cI can tell you that I lived for two years in Qatar and my family and I received wonderful treatment,\u201d the 40-year-old said.\n\u201cQatar is opening up to the Western world and I know the efforts that the Foundation is putting in to do some really good things. I think that we often don\u2019t understand the Muslim world \u2013 nor they us.\nThey need time and Barcelona need money. It\u2019s a perfect fit.\nIsrael international made his first start for Palermo and he didn\u2019t have to wait long to impress his new supporters.\nAfter The Miss comes La Falta, and a huge sigh of relief from Fernando Torres when he saw Valencia\u2019s Roberto Soldado somehow miss the target against Barcelona.\nUruguayan side Nacional\u2019s match Copa Sudamericana game against Universidad de Chile was abandoned early in the second half after a linesman was hit on the head by a toilet roll thrown from the crowd. Mercifully, it was unused.\nThe game was the second this week in the competition to be called off, after crowd violence also marred the previous night\u2019s match in Ecuador between Emelec and Olimpia.\nInter have appointed Claudio Ranieri as their new coach, and the 59-year-old has already vowed to \u201cwake up the team\u201d.\nRanieri told Domenica Sportiva: \u201cInter are a great team. They have had a bad start to the season and I will have to talk to the team to understand why that was.\nRanieri\u2019s managerial cv is as long as your arm, and includes spells at Roma, Juventus, Parma, Fiorentina and Napoli as well as overseas stints at Valencia, Atletico Madrid and Chelsea, where he earned the name the Tinkerman for the frequency with which he rotated his players.\nA day after FIFA confirmed that Issa Hayatou had been installed as head of its London Olympics football organising committee and GOAL Bureau chief, football\u2019s governing body says his appointments were just a \u201ctechnical error\u201d.\n\u201cDue to a technical error, appointments for FIFA standing committees have appeared on the FIFA website,\u201d said the FIFA statement released to media at 19:00 CET on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe appointments for the chairman and deputy chairman of the FIFA standing committees will be communicated in due course.\nHayatou like most people who have been involved in the running of the sport in the past 20 years, has been the subject of corruption allegations and is currently under investigation following Panorama claims last year that he received kickbacks in the 1990s scandal that engulfed FIFA\u2019s now-defunct marketing partner ISL.\nGiven that Hayatou is currently the subject of an International Olympic Committee investigation, the decision to appoint him as the replacement for Mohammed Bin Hammam as head of the 2012 Olympics organising team, did seem a little remiss of FIFA.\nLike appointing Bernie Madoff to replace Nick Leeson, with the whole process overseen by Arthur Anderson.\nSamuel Eto\u2019o has demonstrated that millions of roubles deposited into his bank account following his summer move to Russian side, Anzhi Makhachkala, have not dimmed his competitive edge.\nThe Cameroon striker was involved in an unsightly incident with Dynamo Moscow\u2019s Argentinian defender, Leandro Fernandez, after heading over the bar from close range.\nI can\u2019t lip read and my Spanish is no more than rudimentary, but I suspect that Fernandez might have been saying something about the size of Eto\u2019o\u2019s wage packet and his failure to hit a barn door.\nEto\u2019o appears to have taken to life in Dagestan quite well and has enthused about the welcome he has received from the Anzhi fans.\n\u201cMy team-mates and I personally are very thankful to them. Owing to our supporters we never feel lonely in away matches.\nWhat? They fly in from Norway each week and most of them are living in a mythical past?\nIt\u2019s not often that one gets to share some good news, but there will be few football fans who would begrudge Owen Hargreaves his comeback goal on Wednesday night. The Manchester City midfielder has suffered so many setbacks in recent years that the term injury-plagued doesn\u2019t really do justice to his travails. Dead, would seem more aposite.\nHaving played just six minutes in the past three years, Hargreaves made his debut for City and opened the scoring in their 2-0 Carling cup victory over holders Birmingham City.\n\u201cThe last three years have been a learning curve for me,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cI could never have anticipated myself being in that position which was trying to make the most of a difficult situation.\nOn his overall fitness, Hargreaves was cautiously optimistic, even envisaging a return to the England side.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got to take it step by step,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to get back in training, consistently playing.\nSteady on now Owen. Don\u2019t run before you learn to walk. And in your case, I mean that literally.",

The location for us was wonderful as it was out of the hustle of the city and yet close enough to do anything in the city. The rooms were spacious, clean and well appointed. The property was nice.\nI wish Jaisalmer had a direct flight, just so that I can visit Suraygarh again. Beautiful property with exceptional service. Specially the buffet and the serving staff. Property was full, still there was enough space and service was good. Seems like good service is build into the culture and everyone was really good. Staff brought out breakfast items that were not on the menu, which was great. Would like to call out Manjeet for great seevice. Only thing that was lacking is giving us info on activities provided by Suraygarh. Like safari or dinner at dunes, I asked for infor repeatedly but no one reached out. Rest was great and I will definitely recommend anyone who is going to Jaisalmer.\nWe spent 2 wonderful nights at Suryegarh. It is a little outside of city center of Jaisalmer in the middle of the desert. A charming renovated fort, you arrive there and never want to leave. Service is great, breakfast is a highlight, the rest of the food was good but way overpriced. Pool is under renovation but overall the hotel is still an amazing experience!\nThis hotel was absolutely amazing, perfect for our family. From the numerous reading nooks and gorgeous old artifacts to sublime gardens and exceptional service, we loved every minute of our stay. The animals at breakfast enchanted our 11 and 9 year old kids. The only disappointing thing was that the main pool was out of service having repairs, so there was only a very small (but nice) pool to dip in (it was very hot, so the pool was necessary). I would highly recommend it to anyone. Note that it\u2019s 15 minutes drive outside the craziness of the main town but this was a good thing!\nThe facilities are immaculate. The staff caters towards all your needs, but sometimes it felt that someone is babysitting you. Some personal space without interruption during meals would be a welcome change. Overall, I would recommend the stay at this location.\nTo visit Suryagarh Jaisalmer is atleast once in a lifetime place to visit. We were here for our first anniversary and it was a experience to remember. They have given the feel of Old traditional fort with modern touch. The peace, joy and serenity you feel and absorb at thai place is just beyond words. I will for sure come here many more times in near future.\nWe stayed at the signature suite at suryagarh which were very comfortable and retained the perfect heritage charm. Despite a few glitches here and there the overall experience at the hotel was great. The personalized service at the hotel made us feel at home. Special mention for the staff. They are pros at taking really good care of their guests. Food quality was good.\nGreat stay in a lovely hotel away from the pollution in the city, yet close enough since it's just a 20 minute drive to the fort. The property is beautifully laid out, the colours are restful, there's nothing that jars and the 'chudail trail' late at night is great fun - you mightn't see any ghosts but it's a delightfully spooky experience, and of course, the desert stars are awesome.\nThe hotel is spread over vast property and have all the amenities. The highlight is the breakfast time when you have peacock, dove, tortoise running around in the lobby and you can even feed them. The children will definitely have great time playing with animals and listening to live folk songs. Staff are courteous and will ensure that you have pleasant stay. I would like to thank Mr Sagar for helping us to plan our stay and also upgrading our rooms to ensure children have direct access to lobby. A definite place to stay.\nimpressive building and extensive grounds 6 stars service and attention to detail encountered only in other few 5 starsL world-famous hotels massage to die for think I went to heaven and back a few times in only 75 minutes would have gladly stayed another few days just mooching around well done guys!\nLoved the entire property and the food preparations by Chef Megh Singh Rathore.\nexcellent property and ambience. loved it!\nThe hotel is beautiful, the food is amazing and overall we had an excellent stay. Highly recommend it.\nits a fantastic hotel with best off beat location. one can easily spend about two days just enjoying hostel amenities. staff is so profession al and coperative.\nGreat staff, sublime hotel, delicious food! We will go back.",

In this Creative Sequencing, Seth a car and sport enthusiast, begins the first part of Lexus\u2019s extreme sport series \u201cRide with the Other Me\u201d on one screen, then is able to follow a progressive story of adrenaline-pumping adventures, including sky diving, cliff jumping, and stunt driving, across different devices throughout the day, each time picking up where the series left off. The campaign culminates in a full-screen experience where Seth can watch more videos and explore the high-performance Lexus F Series. Take a look!\nLexus used this innovative multi-screen campaign to build relationships with millennial men and succeeded by increasing awareness for their sport vehicles, reaching their target on a broader scale. The most effective content are based around a story that gets the attention of others to engage with your brand longer. All the high impact content led to an above benchmark click-through rate of 1.3% and 2.1% user interaction rate. The online video ad played a crucial role for Lexus to reach their audience wherever they are and extend the impact of their integrated campaign.\nWith consumers constantly switching between desktop and laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, wearable devices, and connected TVs, it\u2019s difficult to target users with relevant ads. However, a multi-screen strategy is the future for marketers. According to an October report from eMarketer, U.S. adults are expected to spend 22.9% of their time in 2014 on mobile devices (non-voice), compared to desktops/laptops at 17.7%. The average time spent on mobile per day has jumped from 3.7% in 2010 to 13.4% in 2012 and now to 22.9% for 2014 (per the chart below).\nThis increase signals that consumers are quickly taking hold of more screens, and marketers should follow. Marketers should understand the role of each device in order to know how to evaluate the performance of the campaign and the performance by platform. Streaming media is appealing to marketers because it represents a seamless way to integrate audio and video into a website and it allows companies to speak directly to current and prospective customers and to promote their products in a visual, interactive manner.\n\u201cTechnology is putting consumers in control of what, where, when and how they consume content, so it\u2019s incumbent upon marketers to go find their audience and aggregate meaningful impressions across multiple video screens,\u201d said Andrew Ward, group VP of national advertising sales for Comcast Media 360.\nEver since I noticed the buzz around ABC network primetime show Scandal via social media I have been hooked. ABC and the writers are selling an experience and engaging millions of people with weekly do not move from your seat episodes. ABC aired their fall finale of Scandal Season 4 on November 20th, 2014 with a return date of January 29th!\nScandal, a phenomenally popular television show on ABC, has much to teach the social media marketer. Scandal stars Kerry Washington as the fearsome and formidable Olivia Pope, a former White House staffer and professional \u201cfixer\u201d who spends her time managing the crises of Washington\u2019s elite, dodging attempts on her life, and thwarting the advances of her former lover (the President of the United States, no less). There are plenty of conspiracies to unravel and backs to stab, so it\u2019s no wonder that critics and viewers were slow to take to the show when it first aired. Yet by the conclusion of its second season (2013), the show was a bona fide hit, regularly drawing almost 9 million viewers. It\u2019s up even more in the key demographic Adults 18-49 +43% compared with last season, according to Nielsen.\nSo how is emerging media affecting today\u2019s marketing efforts?\nScandal has become a live event where the DVR is not an option. People are spending time in front of the TV with digital and mobile devices and from my experience Twitter is the main way people are interacting with the program followed by Facebook.\nWith over 500,000 Twitter followers and 4.3 million tweets last season ABC succeeded in growing \u201cScandal\u201d brand following.\nUse specific hashtags and existing fans or (#gladiators the label devotees have adopted for themselves) to drive new fans to the show via Twitter. The network, ABC, actively drives viewers to the live-tweeting using both on-air hashtags and promos tagged with voice-overs such as \u201cto tweet with Kerry Washington, use #AskScandal.\u201d After the star Kerry Washington finished live tweeting she gained more than 16,000 followers in one night.\nBy using Twitter and Facebook in just a few creative ways mentioned above, the network has enhanced their traditional ways of advertising in attracting viewers to the show. The combined social network and ratings growth from season one (2012) to season three (2013-14) is truly an overnight success.\nTweet with @kerrywashington and @KatieQLowes tonight at 7PM ET and ask all of your questions using #AskScandal!",

    "text": "The Centre for the Development of Christian Ministry @ Trinity Theological College (TTC) which organises courses to equip Christians for lifelong learning, personal growth and ministry will be offering two evening courses from September to November 2016.\nThis is an historical survey of the Reformation. The course traces the circumstances that gave rise to the Reformation and the different religious, political and cultural forces that coalesced in birthing the Protestant church. It will examine the lives and legacies of some of the prominent reformers and the implications of Karl Barth's comment that \"the church is always to be reformed\" (Ecclesia semper reformanda est) for our present times.\nInstructor: Rev. Dr. Andrew Peh is a faculty of Trinity Theological College and lectures in the area of mission and mission history. He is an alumni of the college (TTC) and Asbury Theological Seminary and his interests are in the history of Christianity in Asia and mission trends in the 21st century. He also serves in the Chinese Annual Conference of the Methodist Church in Singapore as a diaconal minister appointed to Charis Methodist Church.\nVarious ethical issues challenge Christians today: some as a result of the increased sophistication and pervasiveness of technology, others are dilemmas which arise because Christian values are at variance with the world\u2019s. Since these issues are often contentious and divisive, Christians need to develop a theological framework so as to be able to be salt and light in society, with a posture of humility and grace articulating the Christian view. This course will give us the opportunity and to grow in this knowledge and develop these skills.\nInstructor: Dr. Kwa Kiem Kiok teaches at East Asia School of Theology in the areas of Intercultural Studies as well as ethics. She has worked in both para-church organisations as well as her home church, Trinity Methodist Church. When she's not working, she enjoys listening to classical music and reading detective novels.\nFor more information, please visit www.ttc.edu.sg or contact Esther Lee at telephone +65 67613624 or Email cdcm@ttc.edu.sg.

    "text": "Catastrophic storms and an overall depressed economy have forced many Puerto Ricans to migrate to Florida. Over the past few years, over 100 people have made the journey to Florida every single day. The numbers might only be increasing. Once safely settled in the U.S. however, these residents often need vital records documents, such as birth certificates, which have proven hard to get from Puerto Rico.\nFortunately, as the Orlando Sentinel recently reported, Puerto Ricans can now get their vital records at a new office that has opened: the Integrated Services Center (CSI) in Orlando. Typically, Puerto Ricans could only order their vital records by mail or online, and they often had to wait up to 45 days before the records arrived. Now, the records will be issued immediately, which makes things much easier.\nWhy Might You Need Vital Records?\nThere are many reasons you might need them. If you are applying for a job or government benefits, you will most likely need a birth certificate. If you are divorcing, you most likely need a copy of your marriage certificate.\nA death certificate can help you close financial accounts and handle a loved one\u2019s assets. It might also be necessary to show that you are the true owner of property, if the deceased was once the owner.\nAlso, if you are sued for failing to pay child support, you can use a certification to show that you have remained up to date. Without the documentation, a judge might enter an order against you for arrearages and garnish your wages.\nThe CSI office is located at 6925 Lake Ellenor Drive, Suite 100. Its hours are Monday through Friday, 11:30am to 3:30 pm.\nThe new CSI should make things much easier on our state\u2019s new residents. Before, Puerto Ricans living in Florida had to travel back to the island or give a family member a power of attorney to request the documents. These options were impracticable for many people. Now, thankfully, Puerto Ricans can get reliable records in a timely manner.\nWe are a prominent criminal defense law firm located in Orlando and have represented hundreds of people involved in criminal matters in both state and federal court. If you have been accused of a crime, please reach out to us today. We offer a free consultation, which you can schedule by calling 407-377-0150. You have no time to lose.",

    "text": "What Does Peter Mean By Jesus Preaching to the Spirits in Prison?\nThis is among the most difficult verses in the New Testament to understand and preach. The following is shared primarily for the sake of other pastors researching this fascinating verse and wrestling with the challenge of understanding how v.19 fits into the verses before and after.\nThere is a different between teaching and preaching. A sermon must involve teaching the text without getting bogged down by exegetical details. Expository sermons must lead to the heart, not only to the mind. Therefore, passages like 1 Peter 3:19 should not be avoided (lest we unintentionally teach the congregation to be scared of hard Bible passages), but we must not allow them to completely derail the sermon.\n1. When Jesus died his spirit went to the souls of men and women who died in the generation of Noah (referred to in v.20) and preached to them. Other variants of this view allow that he more generally preached to the souls of the dead and not only to Noah\u2019s generation.\n2. Jesus preached to those who were \u201cspiritually imprisoned\u201d through Noah. The difference between this view and the first has to do with time. In the first view, Jesus preached to the souls of those who died. In this view, Jesus preached to them prior to the flood. The two schools of thought here can either mean that the Holy Spirit preached through Noah, or the pre-incarnate Christ preached to that generation in some way.\n3. The spirits in prison are not spirits but angels. These may be demonic spirits since they are in prison or angels of the \u201cguardian angel\u201d variety who oversee humanity. It is not immediately obvious exactly who these spirits are, or what Jesus preached to them.\nExegesis is the process of digging into the biblical text and drawing the meaning out of the text, rather than coming to the text and reading your preferred interpretation into the passage.\nThere are three crucial exegetical details in this one short verse that provide great insight into the meaning of the verse. We\u2019ll look at them in order of how they appear in v.19.\n1. \u201cPreached\u201d not \u201cEvangelized.\u201d There are different Greek words for \u201cpreach\u201d and \u201cpreach the gospel.\u201d The first word is what is used in 1 Peter 3:19. If Jesus was preaching the gospel and providing these spirits an opportunity to believe and repent and be saved, Peter would have used evangelize (as he did in many other places throughout 1 Peter and 2 Peter). Therefore, it seems most reasonable to conclude that the content of this preaching was not an invitation to be saved, but some form of instruction or announcement.\n2. \u201cSpirit\u201d does not mean \u201csoul.\u201d There is no place in the New Testament where the word \u201cspirit\u201d refers to a human soul. I did not personally double check ever single instance throughout the NT, but I\u2019m relying on the many commentaries which point this detail out. If spirit does not mean human soul, then it must refer to either angelic or demonic spirits.\nI prefer not to mix too much interpretation into the translation, so allow me to flesh this out below.\nThere remain outstanding questions, primarily regarding the disobedience mentioned in v.20. I wish I had time to study the accuracy placing a period at the end of v.19, thus rendering the \u201cBecause they formerly did not obey\u201d as the grounds for Noah\u2019s generation being judged through the flood rather than serving as the grounds for the spirits being imprisoned. This exegetical issue aside, I continue to believe the interpretation below is the most reasonable I have been able to discern.\nThe angels in watch are those who have been commissioned by God to watch over humanity. This is widely accepted throughout church history, that there are certain classes of angels who guard and protect humanity.\nJesus preached and declared to them that a new hour of their watch had arrived, where the waters would no longer be a means of judgment (as in the days of Noah, v.20) but of salvation through baptism (v.21). It is a new chapter in Salvation History. The Old Covenant has been fulfilled through the New Covenant, bringing salvation through faith alone in Christ alone. The nations are no longer under condemnation, but salvation is offered to all who believe.\nIn 1 Peter 3:21, Peter clarifies that baptism is \u201can appeal\u201d (ESV) or \u201ca pledge\u201d (NIV) for a good conscience. Baptism is not salvific, nor does it bring salvation the same way water washes away dirt. Instead, it is symbolic of the saving grace of Jesus Christ and reminds the believer of his living hope because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nThrough this interpretation of v.19, there is greater continuity throughout the chapter than with any of the other interpretations. I must confess that while many scholars affirm the \u201cspirits are angels\u201d view, I could not find any who clearly articulated it in this same way. The closest is John Calvin who writes in his commentaries, \u201cIt seems to me that \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u1f74 rather means a watchtower in which watchmen stand for the purpose of watching, or the very act of watching.\u201d He simply states this without clarifying why he prefers this translation and does not fully explain the significance of translating the passage in this way.\nWith that said, I humbly submit the above interpretation and trust that it may help others who are looking to understand 1 Peter 3:19.\nI have often said, \u201cIf you ever preach an original sermon, you\u2019re probably a heretic.\u201d I think the same stands for biblical interpretation. So it is with self-doubt that I offer this interpretation, though it does appear that I\u2019m standing with John Calvin and simply clarifying something he wrote which has gone largely unacknowledged.",

    "text": "My best friend said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the flea market,\u201d and I agreed because there is not much else to do in Brownsville, Texas if you are not doing something that you are doing that is not on the TOP 100 THINGS TO DO IN THE SOUTH PADRE ISLAND/BROWNSVILLE AREA list. Someone recently implied that it must be a sorry place that announces fresh produce as one of its major things to brag about. I beg to differ. This place is paradise. My best friend has lost 150 pounds and if it weren\u2019t for the fresh fruits and vegetables that are so plentiful here, her diet would have been outrageously expensive or so bland it would have been impossible to stick to. My best friend looks beautiful and is now doing some modeling.\nI absolutely love my BFF. She is awesome!\nShe has invited me on her trip into Checkmeoutnowland and I have lost 3 inches at my waist and 15 pounds so far. I want to look good on the beach this summer. I have begun on my New Year\u2019s Resoluting already because I can\u2019t afford to waist time waiting for the 1st of the year. (I figure I need a headstart with all I gotta go.) My new resolution is to get in shape and stay there awhile instead of just look good at the event I aimed for and then go back to my regular lifestyle of eating popcorn while I watch exercise tapes, riding my bike to the nearest ice cream shop, asking the nurse to weigh me again AFTER she takes a blood sample to see if it makes the number lower, ordering a bacon cheeseburger, fries and shake with a DIET Coke and so on. If there were not such a proliferation of fresh fruits and vegetables to choose from, I would not be succeeding as well as I am now on this self-imposed deprivation or as you call it, dieting. These are some of the vegetables we have available here now a week before Christmas.\nA friend whose moniker is Sunclay informed me about what it is like up north and told me the ground is frozen up there. I can\u2019t comprehend that. Frozen dirt? WTH?\nI haven\u2019t traveled anywhere really and never up far up north so I can\u2019t comprehend cold or the seasons of fall or winter. The seasons we have in Texas are: almost summer, summer, late summer, and winter where it may go down into the 30\u2019s for a day or so.\nWe are thankfully NEVER at a loss for incredibly sweet, luscious fruits.\nJuicy citrus is the norm here.\nThere was an episode of Gilligan\u2019s Island where a crate of radioactive vegetables washed up on shore and the vegetables had extraordinary effects on the person who ate them. Mary Ann ate the carrots and could see for miles. Seeing the size of these carrots, bought today \u2013 Dec. 20th, at the local flea market reminded me of that episode.\nI placed the salt and pepper shakers next to these fruits so that your mind could be blown too when you find out that these are Valley lemons not oranges.\nThese fruits reminded me of that catalog I loved to look at so much, Gardener\u2019s Choice, where you can buy freak trees and plants such as this. I always suspected that the genetic engineers there came up with their freaky ideas after work at the lab while sharing a bottle of Jack.\nAgain the Rio Grande Valley has the lowest gas in the nation. People in other parts of this great country are still paying over 3 dollars a gallon in some places.\nWe were in Harlingen trying to get a Halloween costume for our daughter where I was again hit by the \u201cWorst Mom in the World\u201d syndrome. This syndrome is common among parents who are first-timers and discover that if you wait too long to get something you may deem yourself a loser in the parent game. It has happened to me twice at Easter time when I could not for the life of me find an Easter basket in the whole town of Brownsville, apparently I had waited too long and the good parents went and bought them all from all the stores in all the town. I said to myself, \u201cWell, I learned my lesson.\u201d Then it happened to me again the very next year.\nThis time it has happened again but on Halloween. All Walmarts, the specialty Halloween shops, Kmart and Targets are dangerously low on Halloween costumes and I am afraid that if you have not bought yours yet for your little one you are going to be doing the crafty make-your-own this year. I was searching for butterfly wings and was disappointed store after store in town after town in this beautiful valley then only after purchasing a replacement headband that had little ears on it, (I figured she could be a kitty if we painted whiskers on her) did I have the blessed luck to look in a shopping cart of mismatched and miscellaneous items where I found the elusive wings. I almost cried from relief and I said, \u201cThank you, God,\u201d at least ten times thanking Him for the wings and for the bottles that a girl gave me that will allow me to do my art project for the upcoming Mercado on South Padre Island. I did my first bottle already and it looks AWESOME!\nThis guy was smart and got his costume early.",

At these camps, we are enlightened by a number of Alim's and Speakers who give talks and workshops around a central theme for each camp. We also have a number of activities for the youth to participate in all within a friendly, scenic and islamic environment.\nThis year we will be holding a camp between on the 10th-12th July in the beautiful village of Eyam in the peak district. The theme will be centred around Leadership and Imamate.\nWe aim to take 60 people charging \u00a389 per person which leaves us with a shortfall of approximately \u00a31800. We hope that your generous support will allow us to continue with this project.

    "text": "Unlike other Medical text, Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are written by doctors in a clinical setting. As EMRs are relatively new themselves, they lack well defined standards for input and doctors usually write them in free-form dictation These form of text lack proper sentence structure and contain numerous acronyms that only appear in such context, making it difficult to apply current parsing techniques to discover semantic meanings of the text. In this project, methods to identify unknown acronym terms in EMRs and disambiguate their meaning are explored and developed. To better apply automated processes, the EMRs are first pre-processed to restructure their text into a more defined format. Finally these unknown acronym terms are marked up for future use. Results obtained from the formatting of the EMRs showed a precision of 100% and a recall of 67.93%. Initial extraction of acronym-value pairs from the EMRs resulted in 2329 extracted terms with 68.14% true positives, the implementation of an exclusion list, consisting of recurring false positives increased the true positives to 90.99%. While the automated disambiguation process of these true positives could not be implemented, distinct patterns for 31 acronyms were identified which can be used to disambiguate their occurrence in EMRs.",

    "text": "The SCIM has been developed to address three specific areas of function in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI). It looks at self-care (feeding, grooming, bathing, and dressing), respiration and sphincter management, and a patient\u2019s mobility abilities (bed and transfers and indoors/outdoors). Additionally, the SCIM can also be used to help guide clinicians in determining treatment goals and objectives for patients with a SCI. By helping clinicians determine areas of limitations for their patients with spinal cord injuries, both therapists and patients alike will be benefitting from this functional measurement tool.\nThe SCIM has been developed, validated, and found to be highly reproducible for patients with spinal cord injuries.\nEquipment is not needed to perform and utilize this outcome measure.\nThe SCIM takes approximately 30-45 min to administer and score.\nThis outcome measure is very user friendly. Its scoring system is self-explanatory; therefore there isn\u2019t a manual to instruct the clinician in the scoring process. Scores range from 0-100, where a score of 0 defines total dependence and a score of 100 is indicative of complete independence. Each subscale score is evaluated within the 100-point scale (self-care: 0-20; respiration and sphincter management: 0-40; mobility: 0-40).\nThe newly revised SCIM produced by Catz-Itzkovich is a valid and highly reproducible measure of daily function in patients with spinal cord injuries.\nCriterion Validity: difficult to establish due to a lack of \u2018gold standard\u2019 to measure the SCIM against.\nThe SCIM and the SCIM III were found to be more responsive than the FIM.\nThe newest version of the SCIM was preceded by two previous versions. The SCIM I and II were both found to be valid and reliable but did not take into account intercultural differences. Therefore, the SCIM III was developed in 2002 as an international version of the prior forms.(1) Catz et al designed this version to encompass patients in every walk of life, regardless of their culture.\nClick here for an example of how to use and score the SCIM.\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Catz A, Itzkovich M.

    "text": "The Raiders have clearly turned the page from their dysfunctional 2018 season. They have gone about their offseason in an aggressive, win-now mindset that has propelled them on the cusp of competing for the division. The front office of Jon Gruden and Mike Mayock connection seems to have gone well so far, as they have been one of the busiest teams during free agency.\nBefore free agency kicked off, Gruden and Mayock acquired WR Antonio Brown, in exchange for a third and fifth-round pick. Shortly after, they signed OT Trent Brown, making him the highest paid offensive tackle in NFL history. The Raiders stayed on the offensive side of the ball, by signing WR Tyrell Williams and WR J.J Nelson. Defensively, they have signed S Lamarcus Joyner, LB Vontaze Burfict and DE Josh Mauro.\nThe Raiders have addressed both sides of the ball, but still have way more holes on defense. They do hold possession of four draft picks within the first 35 draft selections, so they will look to draft four NFL starters with those picks. Those picks are expected to be defensive driven, to help uplift Paul Guenther\u2019s defense.\nIt\u2019s perfectly clear that Gruden is an offensive coach, but it\u2019s also clear that the Raiders defense is still a ways away from being complete. Since the Khalil Mack trade went down, the Raiders have had no answer to generate a pass rush.\nThe biggest hole on the roster is still an impact edge rusher, who can get after the quarterback. The Raiders ranked dead last in sacking the quarterback last season, and they haven\u2019t done anything to change that narrative. Suitable options to fill that role through the draft are Ohio State\u2019s Nick Bosa, University of Kentucky\u2019s Josh Allen and University of Michigan\u2019s Rashan Gary.\nAnother need on defense for the silver and black is an every down linebacker, that can go sideline-to-sideline. The Raiders have been missing a fierce linebacker to patrol the middle of the field for almost a decade now. Players to target in the draft are Louisiana State\u2019s Devin White, University of Michigan\u2019s Devin Bush and Alabama\u2019s Mack Wilson.\nWith today\u2019s NFL being such a passing league, teams need more than two corner backs that can cover the opposing team\u2019s recivers. The Raiders currently have Gareon Conely and Daryl Worley who are the two staring corner backs. Though, they could use another corner back to complement the defensive back group. Corner backs to target in this year\u2019s draft class are Louisiana State\u2019s Greedy Williams, University of Washington\u2019s Byron Murphy and University of Georgia\u2019s Deandre Baker.",

After a brief hiatus in the mid-90s, The band regrouped in \u201997 and have been dominating Saskatchewan\u2019s live classic rock stages ever since.\nToday, Riff Raff still features original founding members Rory Lawford (lead vocals/guitar) and Brian Kendall (guitar). For the past decade or more, they have been accompanied by the incredible rhythm section of Dave Denowski (bass) and Kevin Sick (drums).\nPerforming with the cohesiveness that can only come from playing hundreds of shows together, a Riff Raff performance is a hard-rocking party with your favourite classic hit songs played with skill, style and fun.\n\"... the most consistently awesome retro live show that you\u2019ll see in this city!\"\n\"Awesome guys !! You are the best in stoon for sure!\"\n\"You guys rocked. You kept the dance floor packed and had everyone dancing and singing\"\nWow! You guys are number \u201cone\u201d in Saskatchewan.

    "text": "The City of Madras has submitted a proposal to COIC for the Daimler Heavy Truck Testing Facility to be considered a regional large lot industrial site through the Regional Large Lot Industrial Program.\nThe City of Redmond has submitted a proposal to COIC for the \u201cSouth Redmond Tract\u201d to be considered a regional large lot industrial site through the Regional Large Lot Industrial Program.\nIn 2008, Central Oregon leaders recognized the economic advantages of an inventory of large lot industrial sites in order to recruit large, traded-sector industrial firms to the region. The Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) funded Deschutes County to do an Analysis to determine the extent of the regional large lot land need in Central Oregon. The Analysis was performed by Johnson-Reid LLC and overseen by representatives from Central Oregon cities, counties, Economic Development for Central Oregon (EDCO), Central Oregon Intergovernmental Council (COIC), 1000 Friends of Oregon, Central Oregon Realtors Association, DLCD, Division of State Lands, and Business Oregon.\nOne 200+ acre site located in the geographic center of the region \u2013 the north side of Bend or the south side of Redmond.\nThe Analysis also noted that current state land use statutes make it difficult to examine land needs at the regional scale \u2013 communities assess land needs on an individual basis \u2013 but that Central Oregon is in reality an integrated regional market for industrial recruitment. The Analysis called for a regional process to identify suitable sites while safeguarding resource lands. COIC, as the region\u2019s Council of Governments, is uniquely suited to coordinate this process.\nDeschutes County\u2019s adoption was challenged by 1000 Friends of Oregon; the challenge was negotiated and settled without appeal.\nThe DLCD agreed to amend, through rule-making, Oregon Administrative Rules Chapter 660-024 (sections -0040(1) and -0045) to limit the applicability of the program to Central Oregon jurisdictions which have entered into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) to allocate the parcels as indicated by the Analysis.\nDeschutes County prepared a Lessons Learned Report, highlighting the process to date.\nCOIC is now responsible for administering the Large Lot Industrial Program, including a site submission and review process. COIC\u2019s role is not to make a land use decision, but rather to a) ensure that candidate sites meet basic criteria identified in the OARs, b) ensure a regional distribution/allocation of sites; and c) review the effectiveness and need for the Large Lot Industrial Land Program over time.\nOn August 29, 2013, COIC hosted a stakeholder Forum to discuss the outcomes of the Program to date and to get stakeholder input on the submission process. The notes of the forum are available here.\nThe final process and submission guidelines can be found here.",

    "text": "Many athletes seek chiropractic care, whether they are professionals or weekend warriors, to enhance their sports performance or help them return to pre-injury status.\nWhether it is musculoskeletal sprain-strains or repetitive stress types of injuries due to sports, at Grant Chiropractic Life Center, P.C. we are focused on our patient\u2019s well being and recovery.\nThrough the use of highly specific and safe spinal and extremity adjustment techniques, therapeutic exercises and stretches, and correction of biomechanical faults, athletes can experience increased performance and reduced risk of injury.\nIn a recent study a group of asymptomatic university baseball players were split into 2 groups; one group received spinal manipulation while their counterparts acted as controls by receiving no care. Vertical jump, broad jump, standing broad jump, muscle strength, blood pressure, pulse rate, microcirculation (nail bed capillary counts) and stress test were evaluated in all athletes prior to the study, as well as a 5 & 14 week follow- up.\nThose receiving spinal manipulation experienced significant improvements in muscle strength and long jump distance at 14 weeks. The spinal manipulation group also experienced improvement in capillary counts at 5 and 14 weeks follow-up. Additionally, the spinal manipulation group had decreases in resting blood pressure and pulse rate following treadmill activity.\nAnother study conducted by Nansel, PhD., found cervical adjustments improved neck range of motion in a group of asymptomatic individuals who had differences of more than 10 degrees in lateral flexion of the head, (Nansel, PhD. JMPT 1989; 12(6):419-27. Schwartzbauer J, DC, Schwartzbauer M, DC, Hart J, DC, Zhang J, MD, PhD. J Vert Sublux Res).\nStrains, tendonitis, muscle soreness and stress fracture of the bone often occur with excessive or repetitive activity. The warning signs can be aches and pains which gradually get worse as one continues with the activity. The most vulnerable parts of the body are knees, back, wrists, neck and shoulders.\nRepetitive strain injuries cannot usually be exercised away, neither does resting resolve the injury. Following an extensive orthopedic and neurological examination, our doctors will assess each case and determine what type of chiropractic care and physical medicine is appropriate for each patient.\nReady to recover your mobility and increase performance?",

Dance to live music performed by the Hey!Makers with Luke Abbott on fiddle, Craig Mitchell on clawhammer banjo, and Lor Larson on guitar. Claire Takemori will be calling the dances. All beginners should be sure to show up at 2 for active lessons!\nThere's no \"cultural starvation\" in our little part of the world. We're a welcoming haven for artists, musicians, poets, authors, dancers, actors, scientists and teachers of the arts and sciences for our children. We are indeed fortunate for these sweet moments of beauty that are available in schools, private studios and often for free in our streets and parks. How can we share that? And, Moms, Dads, are you nourishing yourselves?!\n\"Children need art and stories and poems and music as much as they need love and food and fresh air and play. \"\nChildren need art and stories and poems and music as much as they need love and food and fresh air and play. If you don't give a child food, the damage quickly becomes visible. If you don't let a child have fresh air and play, the damage is also visible, but not so quickly. If you don't give a child love, the damage might not be seen for some years, but it's permanent.\nBut if you don't give a child art and stories and poems and music, the damage is not so easy to see. It's there, though. Their bodies are healthy enough; they can run and jump and swim and eat hungrily and make lots of noise, as children have always done, but something is missing.\nIt's true that some people grow up never encountering art of any kind, and are perfectly happy and live good and valuable lives, and in whose homes there are no books, and they don't care much for pictures, and they can't see the point of music. Well, that's fine. I know people like that. They are good neighbours and useful citizens.\nBut other people, at some stage in their childhood or their youth, or maybe even their old age, come across something of a kind they've never dreamed of before. It is as alien to them as the dark side of the moon. But one day they hear a voice on the radio reading a poem, or they pass by a house with an open window where someone is playing the piano, or they see a poster of a particular painting on someone's wall, and it strikes them a blow so hard and yet so gentle that they feel dizzy. Nothing prepared them for this. They suddenly realise that they're filled with a hunger, though they had no idea of that just a minute ago; a hunger for something so sweet and so delicious that it almost breaks their heart. They almost cry, they feel sad and happy and alone and welcomed by this utterly new and strange experience, and they're desperate to listen closer to the radio, they linger outside the window, they can't take their eyes off the poster. They wanted this, they needed this as a starving person needs food, and they never knew. They had no idea.\nThat is what it's like for a child who does need music or pictures or poetry to come across it by chance. If it weren't for that chance, they might never have met it, and might have passed their whole lives in a state of cultural starvation without knowing it.\nThe effects of cultural starvation are not dramatic and swift. They're not so easily visible.\nAnd, as I say, some people, good people, kind friends and helpful citizens, just never experience it; they're perfectly fulfilled without it. If all the books and all the music and all the paintings in the world were to disappear overnight, they wouldn't feel any the worse; they wouldn't even notice.\nWritten by Philip Pullman for the tenth anniversary of the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in 2012. More from Philip Pullman here.\n\"Hear that change jingling in my pocket? Good. I have two little questions for you.\nWhat can be better than seeing a classic movie with good friends?\nSpecial Instructions: To make sure that everybody has comfortable accommodations, please RSVP by emailing or via the Event Facebook page.\nOur third film is Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936), with Freddie Bartholomew in main role. This is perhaps the best screen adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's early masterpiece, which was much more popular during her life than Secret Garden, for which she is better known now.\nIs the boy so kind and earnest because of his low EQ, which prevents him from reading \"real\" feelings of those around him, or because of the strength he derives from his mother's love and integrity? Is his mother self-sacrificing or just is secure enough to do exactly what she reckons to be right? Is it possible for a heart of the old worldly, crusty, and selfish aristocrat to thaw and start believing in the goodness of his grandson and its ability to better this world?",

    "text": "Post has been edited 2 time(s), last time on Mar 27 2010, 2:55 pm by poiuy_qwert.\nSeems a bit redundant since there's already MacroTriggers to do basically the same thing, or am I wrong and there's stuff in this that MacroTriggers can't do?\nIt's much less strict of a language than MacroTriggers, and since it's built on Python, anything allowed in Python goes, which means a lot more open coding. My only complaint is that the style of the code, although efficient once you understand it, doesn't seem very user friendly. I'm currently writing Mystic Islands RPG in MacroTriggers, but when that's finished, I may try this one out for working on Fort Ethanios and see how they compare.\nyoonkwun: Well actually I wouldn't have made this since MacroTriggers is there, but I actually started this a while before MactroTriggers and it has been sitting on my USB, 30 minutes of coding away from being done (and a few people have been asking me about it). You are correct for most of the things you need to do, MacroTriggers can do it, but there are a few things ProTRG can do that MacroTriggers cant. Also, as Falkoner said Python is a much more open language (its also dynamic and not strongly typed) and has a large backend if you so happened to need something from it. I've also released the source code, and since its written in Python it can be use on Mac and Linux (like MacroTriggers i believe).\nDoes it actually make triggers into data structure representations or is it simply a collection of functions that print to trigedit text?\nEverything is custom classes. Trigger is a class, every condition is a class that inherits from the Condition class (which inherits from the Raw class), every action is a class that inherits from the Action class (which inherits from the Raw class as well). The way it works is there is an internal list of triggers (which can actually be manually modified), when you create a Trigger object with the add keyword parameter set as True (which is default) or use the addTrigger method on a Trigger object, that object is added to the end of the list. When the script is done the Triggers are printed in order they are in the internal trigger list. Some more info can be found in the Coding section of the readme or original post.\nEdit: Ah neat, just finished reading. I'll see if I can't learn me some Python later to try it out.\nAlso: Does it validate condition and action field types? It'd help a lot to not have to dig through compile errors in trigedit to find out I accidentally put a unit where a location was supposed to go in some random trigger (an annoyingly common mistake for me, alas).\nPost has been edited 4 time(s), last time on Jan 11 2010, 7:38 am by Tuxedo-Templar.\nDoes it validate condition and action field types? It'd help a lot to not have to dig through compile errors in trigedit to find out I accidentally put a unit where a location was supposed to go in some random trigger (an annoyingly common mistake for me, alas).\nThere is a little bit of compile checking, but the scenario you stated could happen, since the parameters are meant to be as accepting as possible.\nI'm glad it can be of use to you!\nI can print hello world in python. I think (if you do decide to release an update) that you should automatically add conditions and actions comments.\nI definitely will be updating ProTRG, but I don't know what you mean by condition and action comments.\nAnd it will be able to tell myUnit is not meant to be a LOCATION and throw an exception.\nEdit2: I knew i forgot something! EUD support! Which parameters of which conditions does SCMDraft support extended units and extended players?\nPost has been edited 3 time(s), last time on Jan 12 2010, 11:22 pm by poiuy_qwert.\nAlso, what about compiling multiple source files into a single project? Don't say \"just run it for each file\" because I like to do stuff like put variable declarations and code into separate files.\nAlso, what's a good way with Python in Notepad++ to make foldable blocks for hierarchically organizing large groups of triggers? I couldn't live without something like that.\nPost has been edited 5 time(s), last time on Jan 15 2010, 9:01 am by Tuxedo-Templar.\nI didn't quite think this one through when making it. You can use Pythons built in import command but that only lets you import files with Python extensions (not .txt or .protrg). I'll add a specific pre-processor for ProTRG imports in the next version, which should be out fairly soon.\nThis is my one problem with Notepad++, custom highlighters cant use a Python based system for foldable blocks, which means using the ProTRG user defined highlighter will not give you the folding blocks. The only way to do it is to switch to using the built in Python highlighter. The problem in this case is the ProTRG specific keywords and stuff will no longer be highlighted and/or give autocomplete hints (unless you can add the ProTRG stuff to the Python stuff, i'll look into that the next time I can), but the reference.txt can be used in its place.\nI'd be glad to know that at least someone is using it!\nHmm. MacroTriggers uses a custom highlighter and managed foldable blocks by using block openers and closers within line comments (//> to open, //< to close). Would doing something like that be an option?\nDoes your autocomplete let you fill in each of a function's parameters one after the other? If not, then it's nigh useless anyway. I rarely use autocomplete with MacroTriggers since I can only autocomplete condition or action names; not parameters. I use NP++ macros bound to numpad keys + Ctrl for the most common condition and action types, though, which is just about all I need.\nPost has been edited 4 time(s), last time on Jan 15 2010, 11:40 pm by Tuxedo-Templar.\nAh yes I forgot about that option. I'll add that for the next release.\nThe autocomplete is the same for any Notepad++ language API, there's not really any way around it.\nI can print hello world in python.\nThis is just perfect. I'm spending my time today learning to use this.\nOh yeah, this should be more flexible than MacroTriggers, which I've been semi annoyed with due to Wormer not working on it, but since this is built on Python, there should be very few things that are annoying, comparatively. Also, make sure you add the collapsable comments (//> //<) because those really allow you to do serious organization, splitting trigger systems into functions, that can be tucked away neatly once finished, I can't begin to explain how wonderful making Mystic Islands has been with that ability.\nWell there is one thing that annoys me about APIs versus custom languages: Readability takes a major hit. Not that there aren't ways to compensate, and through them, perhaps even improve readability... but at a cost. Doing that ventures into a territory solidly away from trigger making and into near-full fledged scripting. The complexity involved stands to become amped up significantly.\nStill. It is the 'right' approach, if it's trigger abstraction we're going for. Though I'd probably revert back to MacroTriggers if it were just upgraded a bit (or maybe not; I am starting to enjoy having regex again, now ). Trigger making can (and should) be handled in only so many advanced ways, really. No matter how much scripting you wrap it with, triggers can't (or shouldn't, I should say) be turned into a scripting language themselves. You could get pretty darn close, though. A lot of Starcraft's functions need to be handled much too intimately for proper abstraction, though.\nSimplicity and readability are still important goals, therefore.\nPost has been edited 6 time(s), last time on Jan 18 2010, 4:11 am by Tuxedo-Templar.\nSo I messed a little bit with this today, and here is one of the things I made. What this does, is it defines the function Hyper() as a hyper trigger. Now, within the code I can call the function Hyper and it will output a hyper trigger for me. I can also use loops to call multiple amounts of hyper triggers. Here is my code that goes into the input .protrg file.\nJust thought I should share this, as some people might find it useful.\nPost has been edited 4 time(s), last time on Jan 18 2010, 7:41 am by CecilSunkure.",

That harm sometimes comes because of his chosen course is what makes it a dilemma. He HAS to make a decision, knowing that harm will come about whatever he does, and he does his best, with the knowledge he has at hand, in the circumstances in which he finds himself, given the obligations he is ethically bound to live up to, to make the most moral choice.

    "text": "Here is where we finally talk about Born Again. I\u2019ve intentionally avoided talking about any comic-book source material thus far \u2014 I generally prefer to talk about the show for what it is, and not compare it against whatever it may be adapted from. But, more than any season before it, Daredevil season three is working from a single comic-book story \u2014 perhaps the most famous Daredevil story, Born Again, by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli.\nAs far as seminal graphic novels go, Born Again is an oddity. It\u2019s considered a quintessential Daredevil graphic novel, but Daredevil is barely in it. Instead, it\u2019s a story about Matt Murdock hitting rock bottom, as Wilson Fisk (not imprisoned, and operating with impunity as the Kingpin of Crime) learns Murdock is Daredevil, and uses his power and influence to ruin him. There\u2019s little in the way of action, and it\u2019s not great for getting a good sense of what Matt Murdock is like \u2014 he spends most of it paranoid and destitute, living on the streets and barely keeping it together.\nOne of the fascinating things about the third season of Daredevil is how it\u2019s translated the narrative of Born Again to make sense in this version of the Daredevil story. Entire scenes are re-created in new contexts (Matt being sent to the bottom of the Hudson in a taxi), story beats large and small are rethought (literally everything involving Karen Page), and new elements (most notably, Agent Rahul Nadeem, and this show\u2019s version of Bullseye) \u2014 are folded in. It\u2019s an interesting thing to take apart, if you\u2019ve read the comic.\nIn many ways, it improves on the source material, making more thoughtful choices than the original comic did. (I really can\u2019t stress enough how Born Again\u2019s subplot wherein Karen Page, who has become a strung-out junkie who sells Daredevil\u2019s secret identity for another hit needed reworking.) In others, it\u2019s a little less satisfying, namely in the service of being a TV show. A big part of what makes Born Again work is its unbearably sharp focus on Matt\u2019s descent \u2014 something that Daredevil knows would make for unbearably grim television, but it also meanders too much in its efforts to ratchet up a comparable level of dread and despair across its entire cast.\nThe show\u2019s compromise, then, is Rahul Nadeem, the good cop with just the right amount of zeal and arrogance to facilitate his own undoing, and give Wilson Fisk a clear path back to power. If you\u2019ve been frustrated by the focus on Nadeem, \u201cRevelations\u201d hopes to prove that it\u2019s all been worthwhile. And for the most part, it works.\nIn \u201cRevelations,\u201d Nadeem finds out he\u2019s been so thoroughly and completely rolled that there\u2019s nothing to do but gape in horror. This moment comes just as he\u2019s about to try and right himself, bringing the Office of Professional Responsibility\u2019s Agent Winn to Hatley\u2019s home so he can tell her, safe from prying ears, about the vast conspiracy he\u2019s begun to suspect he\u2019s played into. But as soon as Hatley opens her door and apologizes for renovations, I knew it was over. Renovations means tarps everywhere. Tarps everywhere means that Hatley can shoot Winn in the middle of Nadeem\u2019s taped confession with the gun that he handed over to her, record herself screaming as if Nadeem killed Winn, and give the recording to Fisk\u2019s fixer, Felix Manning, who\u2019s been waiting in the wings.\nIt turns out that Hatley has been in Fisk\u2019s pocket from the start, doing her part to try and dissuade Nadeem from involving himself too much, or crossing a threshold like this one where she had no choice but to blackmail him and bring him fully under Fisk\u2019s control.\nNow, there are no more pretenses. Dex, now Fisk\u2019s willing stooge and also a fully reinstated FBI agent, becomes Nadeem\u2019s shadow, intimidating him at home, making him call Daredevil to lure him into a trap, taking him to his first meeting with law-enforcement officials who are also completely in Fisk\u2019s thrall, doing his bidding, calling him by a code name: Kingpin.\nI realize that, while I\u2019ve done it casually as I know these characters from the comics, Daredevil has never actually used Wilson Fisk\u2019s comic-book alias \u2014 mostly because it\u2019s kind of silly. A crime lord as clever as the Fisk of this show, working so effectively from the shadows, giving himself a nickname? Poppycock. Being a person who generally prefers comic-book adaptations to fully embrace their comic-book roots, I disagree with that decision, but it\u2019s redeemed here: Wilson Fisk has, from captivity, managed to achieve a level of influence that supersedes the reach he had when free. That\u2019s a whole new level of power. That\u2019s an ascent to supervilliany, complete with an honest-to-God supervillain name.\nIf there were any doubt about this, it\u2019s solidified when Dex and Nadeem accompany Fisk to a meeting with the last remaining major players in the underworld. It\u2019s a moment where Fisk fully flexes his power to both Nadeem and the assembled bosses, showing the former that his house arrest has been a fiction this whole time, and the latter that Fisk has the FBI under his sway.\nThis was also meant to be a performance for the benefit of Matt Murdock, but Matt, suspecting Nadeem is setting him up under duress, doesn\u2019t show up to the meet. He really, really wants to though. He\u2019s spiraling further due to the revelation that Sister Maggie is his mother, but instead of confronting her in the sanctuary, he finds Father Lantom, who spends his free time in a dive bar shooting pool with people who have no idea he\u2019s a priest. And all he had to do was remove the white collar!\nMatt, quite reasonably, feels betrayed by Father Lantom for all of the years he knew Sister Maggie was his mother and did not tell him, even though he was an orphan who thought himself alone. Lantom has little to say for himself, other than how we often aren\u2019t willing to see our parents as people.\nSo we get a flashback, where we see exactly that. A young Maggie, as a nun who hasn\u2019t taken her vows yet, sneaking off with her friends to see a boxing match where Battlin\u2019 Jack Murdock is fighting. How she falls for him when he asks her to be his cutman, because a nun wouldn\u2019t slip anything into his water. How she goes home with him, they have a child, and she slips into postpartum depression, believing herself to have betrayed God.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether or not Lantom told Matt any of this \u2014 but he\u2019s hearing his father\u2019s voice now, haunted by his apparition as he breaks back into the old gym where his dad used to fight and starts to rope his hands up, with the intention of taking Nadeem\u2019s bait and fighting his way through Dex to kill Fisk.\nThroughout, Jack Murdock\u2019s voice is telling Matt that he\u2019s playing himself, that Daredevil is just a way for him to feel better about being a violent man. And soon, his dad\u2019s voice becomes Fisk\u2019s, taunting him until Matt fantasizes about beating Fisk bloody, breaking his neck. He arises from the bench he never got up from, calm, and leaves to carry out his plan.\nFor a few minutes, Daredevil lets us think that Matt has completely fooled himself into thinking that he can take Dex and Fisk, despite their trap. But it turns out the building that we see Matt breaking into isn\u2019t the restaurant where Fisk is meeting, but the hotel where he\u2019s supposed to be under house arrest. Matt finds Fisk\u2019s secret room, and the woman he\u2019s blackmailed into monitoring every feed when he\u2019s not there and wearing his ankle bracelet when he\u2019s not around. He also learns that Fisk\u2019s people have found Karen Page at the Clinton church he\u2019d been staying at, and that they want her dead.",

    "text": "From June 10th- June 27th I woke up in a guest room, on a futon, or on an air mattress and smiled. I smiled because I was actually doing it. Taking a chance on myself and following the plan I set to get to my goal of becoming the first African American female professional road cyclist. I had the opportunity to race Tulsa Tough, The Harlem Skyscraper Classic, and the Final three days of The Tour of America's Dairyland. First up, Tulsa Tough!\nI've been listening to the Hamilton Soundtrack on repeat, I believe Washington summed up my emotions the best. I felt \"outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered, and outplanned.\" Regardless, I was there, I was exactly where I'd asked to be, so I was going to get the job done.\nThe first day was tough, but I did it, despite getting caught up behind a crash, I got back into the race and finished 29th. The rest of the weekend didn't go as well.\nThe second day came with a super high, and a super low. This was the first day of my life that I saw the very front of a pro bike race. Me, Ayesha Rosena Anna McGowan was sitting second wheel. I wasn't clinging to the back, I wasn't getting lapped, I WAS IN THE FREAKING FRONT!!!! Sometimes I can't remember if I'm tired or excited. Bike racing is a bit of both most of the time. Unfortunately, my glory moment was short lived. I overheated, lost everything I ate that day, and ended up in an ambulance cooling off trying to stop everything from spinning. That was the opposite of fun. Despite my stomach issues, I was so amazed that I'd actually seen the front of that race. It was the first time I felt like I belonged. Like I wasn't just trying to be a part of it, but that I WAS a part of it. I was dizzy, and hot, and felt pretty awful, but I was also super excited for that glimpse of my progress.\nOn the third day I was determined to crush. I lined up in the front, and prepared to make Crybaby hill beg for mercy. First time up, my exact thoughts were \"well that wasn't so bad\". Little did I know that it wasn't the climb I should've been worrying about. About fifteen or twenty minutes into the race, I was moving up before turn four and before I knew it, I was donating my skin to the Tulsa pavement. It just so happened to be right next to my newest pals at the medical tent. The medic asked if I wanted to go on. My adrenaline was PUMPING. I recall saying \"if my bike is okay, i'm going back in\". He sent me to the pit, and while they checked over my bike, I started to throw up. The official asked, \"are you going back in?\" I said, yes! Then I threw up again. So I said, \"nope, I'm done\". And that was that. I felt so deflated. I was confused, and sore, and upset. I found my phone, called Will, and started to cry. There might not be crybabies in bike racing, but I was definitely crying. I'm not ashamed of it either. All I could think was \"I was doing so well\", but I also knew that I didn't want a repeat of the previous day and it was better that I not over do it. While I was on the phone bawling like a disappointed child, the very kind gentlemen at the Saris Cycleops tent handed me a pair of socks and put this very peculiar \"naked baby on a bicycle\" necklace around my neck. I probably looked beyond pathetic. I appreciate his efforts to console me.\nDespite having very little success at Tulsa, I actually learned a lot from the experience. I perfected the race day timeline necessary to get a good spot at staging, and I learned about pantyhose ice packs. Mid summer races are brutally hot, it's little tips like the pantyhose ice pack that keeps you cool and competitive! I also learned that I am strong, and capable, and making progress. So sweeeet!\nThank you so much to Katie, Scott, Rascal, and Gracie for welcoming me into their home. Thanks to the city of Tulsa for being so kind. Thank you to the Tulsa Tough organizers for putting on a spectacular series of events. Thank you to the medical tent for taking care of me when I wasn't at my best. Thanks to SRAM NRS for always dealing with my clinks and clanks despite my refusal to use real bike terminology. Thanks to News 6 for this impromptu interview, and to the old lady who asked for my autograph and made me feel like a superstar. Thank you to Hatchmap, Cannondale, and Starlight Custom Apparel for supporting me on this endeavor. And thank you to all of you who bother to read this blog and/or share your support and kind words with me. It really keeps me going, Thank you!\nThis one didn't have such a happy ending, but that's fine. I learned a ton, and didn't break anything. Always look on the bright side of life! Enjoy this gallery of photographs. You've probably already seen many of them if you follow me on the instagrams!",

    "text": "Paul Krugman on Twitter: \"Are people noticing that the Trump economic team is shaping up as a gathering of gold bugs?\"\nThe gold standard was invented to constrain government spending. Nations that agreed to exchange money for gold thought twice before printing more money. And lately, Republicans have found themselves yearning for such restraint.\nThe gold standard is a topic that, for reasons that Ip notes, is likely to recur during the presidential primaries and general election. It is a complicated one and one which it really is valuable to get the nuances right. And it fully deserves return to the mainstream.\nHis third element is sound money, which, he said at Boulder, would \u201cideally\u201d mean a dollar tied to gold. That would make it harder to fund a socialist government, reduce the need for vast financial hedging, and focus investment in productive directions.\n\"The COMEX gold futures market in New York and the Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades cleared through the London Bullion Market Association do set prices which are followed most widely in the world. They are also markets dominated by a handful of huge players, the six London Bullion Market Association gold clearing banks \u2014 the corrupt JP MorganChase bank; the scandal-ridden UBS bank of Zurich; The Bank of Nova Scotia \u2014 ScotiaMocatta, the world's oldest bullion bank which began as banker to the British East India Company, the group that ran the China Opium Wars; the scandal-ridden Deutsche Bank; the scandal-ridden Barclays Bank of London; HSBC of London, the house bank of the Mexican drug cartels; and the scandal and fraud-ridden Societe Generale of Paris,\" Engdahl narrated.\nDeutsche Bank AG Tuesday raised its outlook for gold and silver prices in 2013 and 2014, citing support from stimulus measures by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nThe bank raised its 2013 gold forecast by 3% to $2,113 a troy ounce and its 2014 outlook by 11.1% to $2,000/oz. Next year, the price of gold could exceed $2,200/oz, it said.\nSimilarly, Deutsche Bank increased its 2013 outlook on silver by 3% to $44/oz and its 2014 forecast by 11.1% to $40/oz.\nA major support for precious metal prices are the recent moves by central banks to expand their balance sheet, said the bank. Since gold is often sought as a hedge against currency weakness and inflation at times of loose monetary policy, such moves tend to boost its appeal to investors.\n\"We believe central bank action to stimulate growth, avoid deflation and reduce systemic risk is unambiguously bullish for the precious metals sector and specifically gold,\" said Michael Lewis, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\"While we have targeted gold prices moving above $2,000/oz since the beginning of 2011, we believe the Fed's open-ended program of QE announced last month increases our confidence that a surge in the gold price above this level is only a matter of time,\" he added.\nOne of the most commonly held beliefs among gold investors is that the market for gold is heavily manipulated.\nIs Russia Moving to a Gold-Backed Currency?\nRussia is probably not going to issue a gold-backed currency. It's not going to overtake the U.S. economically in any way. However, the Russians can set a good example of smarter economic policies moving forward for some of the other big players such as China and Japan. That includes exchanging U.S. government debt for gold.\nFrench paper Le Parisien didn\u2019t mince words in the headline: \u201cLa chasse au cash est lancee\u201d. Basically \u2018hunting season on cash is launched\u2019.\nBarely months after gold import rules were eased, the government is looking to re-impose curbs as the country's insatiable appetite has led to a surge in the yellow metal coming into India, threatening to undermine the improvement in external balances.\nThe trade deficit worsened to an 18-month high of $14 billion in September following a 450% rise in gold imports as importers rushed to take advantage of lower prices. \"Gold imports have risen since the norms were relaxed.\nAre We Going To See Massive Confiscation Of Wealth By Banks!?\nRussia and China need to ensure their gold and currency reserves are secure, Russia's President Vladimir Putin told foreign journalists at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin plans to open the door to Chinese money as U.S. and European sanctions over Ukraine threaten to tip the economy into recession, according to two senior government officials.\nThe Chinese won\u2019t be welcome in all areas: Russia plans to set \u201cred lines\u201d around significant gold, platinum-group metals, diamond mining and high-technology projects, the officials said.",

    "text": "Now more than ever, kids are in need of healthy skills to manage stress and cope with difficult emotions. Increased school workloads, heightened expectations, even social and political adversity can increase a child\u2019s stress level. Integrating yoga and mindfulness practices into their lives not only helps kids to relax when they feel upset, discouraged, or depressed; but it also helps them to live in a state of higher awareness and put their stresses into perspective. Just like adults, kids who practice yoga are more likely to be focused, less reactive, and live happier, healthier lives.\nFlow and Grow Kids Yoga Teacher Training is ideal for educators, clinicians, childcare workers, parents, and anyone who loves working with children and teens. The weekend training teaches participants how to create a dynamic curriculum that stimulates, empowers, calms and strengthens our next generation. Learn child development, classroom management, the impact of praise, and other relevant theories and practices regarding yoga and education. Graduates will leave with the tools to empower children to become strong, mindful, balanced individuals and leaders!\nParticipants receive a training manual by Lara Hocheiser that is full of invaluable information to further your professional development and to encourage your collaboration with others.",

Can you define it?\n-- Aet Tunissoo (tonissoo@ra.gov.ee), November 18, 1999.\nMy magic is being able to fade into the background, to be unnoticed, and just *observe* people and things.\n-- Tree (pmanzella@hotmail.com), November 18, 1999.\nA few things come to mind, which makes me think I don't have a good grip on it, but I'm in that rambling-all-over-the-map kind of place today, so here I go anyway.\nResilient courageousness - I seem to keep coming back to face [difficult] things, to embrace them for healing and growth.\nAccepting what is, with loving-kindness.\nAnd these days I feel the stirrings of a deep joyfulness and celebration. I think it will take a while for that to be a part of my magic, though.\n-- Shimon Walner (usemyfirstname@technologist.com), November 18, 1999.\nPaying close attention to people or things.\n-- Chris (chris@clatimer.freeserve.co.uk), November 18, 1999.\nMagic - the use of charms to contol events; the art of illusion. What's my charm, then? How do I spin the everyday into gold? I have no clue. The thing I like most about myself is that I try - I wade in, I worry a problem like a dog with a bone, I wrestle it into submission - I fall back and pant and get revived and try again. I slog, I plod - I don't give up until I'm damn good and ready. Doesn't feel very magical, though.\n-- Catherine (hinesc@mindspring.com), November 18, 1999.\n~AWARENESS~Being able to go beyond the everyday dribble.The ability to survive based on my own personal belief system set up by that very awareness, that this is not all that is and everything is possible.I am blessed with the ability to see through the eyes of an artist,hear with the ears of a musician,smell with the scent of a coonhound,play guitar with the hands of my ancestors,and speak with the honesty of a child.On a heightened day I travel worlds beyond this one and all those senses merge into one hell of a spiritual experience. Over all, \"MAGIC is my MAGIC!\"\n-- Donna Carter (DeeJaye53@hotmail.com), November 18, 1999.\nan extreme curiousity, to learn, to meet, to understand something other than the norm. this leads to a dedication, motivation.\n-- a grasp on the \"inner child\".\n-- El (eparkins@mail.coin.missouri.edu), November 18, 1999.\nThe ability when I write -- when I *really* write instead of jot -- to tune in to something bigger. Witness last night's magic: I was really pushing, pulling, coaxing, stroking it ... waiting ... trying ... to say something worthwhile and wah la! Synchronicity.\nIf that ain't magic, I don't know what is.\n-- Nancy Birnes (turret@mediaone.net), November 18, 1999.\nMy magic, I think, is comfort. I can sit quietly with those in pain. I know if someone needs an old soft blanket, a dirty joke, or a listening ear. I know how to change the feel of a sad or angry room. My spells are filled with candles, wind, cats, strong coffee, homemade soups, books and cinnamon. They are dusty but strong old spells, and I hear them weaved into Catherine's writings and that makes me smile. I wish at times I had a wild, intense magic! I can't sing or dance, and I don't turn mens heads when I walk down the street...but thats okay. I think my magic element is earth.\n-- Eloise (tiss57@hotmail.com), November 18, 1999.\n-- special k (specialk@asarian-host.org), November 19, 1999.\nCreation is my magic. Whether the fathering of children to imagining worlds, creation is king.\nAl, who is alive and well and at Nova Notes.\n-- Al Schroeder (al.schroeder@nashville.com), November 19, 1999.\ni've been thinking about this, over and over again, since you posted the questions. i can't see my magic. i have this deeprooted disbelief that it exists. sure, there are moments when i feel like the queen of the world, spinning around, stirring people up with crazy ideas and open eyes.\nmaybe it's just that i'm too dazzled by the magic of others, the magic all around me.\n-- heyoka (katie@heyoka.com), November 19, 1999.\nMy magic is a secret world I spin around myself. Gossamer silk that encloses a places, captures many ideas, impassions creativity and lets me be who I am outside the give and take of ordinary life. Secret thoughts, secret visits, secret writing...even a very few secret people. If everything we have is an open book, then there is no place to retire to when the weight of the day grows too heavy. My secret world is also my Achilles heel, because when things go wrong within this private place I can't tell anyone, can't even express my distress to those around me. Like most magic, secrets cut both ways.\n-- Michele (michele@excerpta.org), November 19, 1999.\nOccasionally (far from usually), I just... *shine*. People are attracted to me on sight. Sometimes sexually, more often just curious to know me better. But it's not a glow, or a sparkle - we're talking 200W incandescent lightbulb here. S'been a curse as often as a blessing. And it only happens occasionally. I think it's related to the manic part of my SADD, though not directly related. Anyway.\n-- marianne aldrich (marseillaise@hotmail.com), November 20, 1999.\nHeyoka said: \"maybe it's just that i'm too dazzled by the magic of others, the magic all around me.\"\nBut I say, that IS your magic, Heyoka! That you are AWARE of all that beauty, grandeur, quiet simplicity, and so forth! THIS is what I claim too, as my magic. The awareness of the magic, both within those private moments with self, when I am simply awed for beauty's sake, and in communion with others. That I can capture just a small part of this in my creations gives me joy.",

In such a darkish abyss, fish are drawn to the light delay by the organ and as soon as they are shut sufficient the fangtooth fish catches them in his numerous giant teeth. For more about alpaca 2014 have a look at our own website. He seems to be like an underwater vampire. One other carnivorous sea animal is the deep-sea lizardfish. These interesting fish look virtually like a brief snake in water. Their mouths are covered with harpoon-tipped teeth that grasp their prey and don't let go, just like a fish hook. These teeth are hinged so that they can flattened down when prey is going in and stand up when resisting. They don\u2019t even must actively swallow; the struggling prey just ratchets itself inside.",

    "text": "Below is a letter in response to the recent decisions made by the Israeli government written by the Rehovot and Minneapolis Partnership2Gether steering committee members. This letter will also be published in the Rehovot newspaper.\nWe, the undersigned, Israeli citizens from Rehovot and members of the Jewish community in Minneapolis (Minnesota), voluntarily serve as members on the steering committee of Partnership2Gether within the framework of the Jewish Agency.\nOur partnership \u2013 along with its 46 members of this global network of communities \u2013 connect Jewish communities in Israel and around the world, with an emphasis on deepening our Jewish identity and Jewish Peoplehood awareness, community building, and leadership development. We run a variety of programs for children and youth, college students, educators, and social entrepreneurs. Our activities are funded by the Jewish community in Minneapolis, the Jewish Agency, and the Rehovot Municipality.\nFor us, the citizens of Rehovot, our personal acquaintance with our friends in Minneapolis revealed the rich diversity of the Diaspora Jewry, in which Jews from different streams manage to maintain a cohesive community, to address issues, to respect each other and at the same time strengthen the common values, culture, and awareness.\nThis exposure enriched both our own world as well our Jewish identity and deepened our commitment to fight for Jewish pluralism in the State of Israel. We are dismayed and concerned with how the persistence of one particular interpretation of Judaism in the Jewish state achieves the exact opposite of what is intended, and even contradicts the Declaration of Independence. It distances many Israelis from the Jewish component of their identity rather than uniting.\nFor us the Jews of Minneapolis, who see firsthand (as a result of our partnership with Rehovot) the challenges in the Israeli society, the June 25th government decisions are yet another slap in the face with the ongoing saga of non-recognition and humiliation towards us, in the Diaspora. We are shocked that the Israeli government has chosen to cancel a historic agreement that was reached with great effort amongst representatives of the various Jewish streams: to establish a dignified area at the Western Wall to be run by the government and the liberal streams. We are equally appalled with the Conversion Law, which reinstates the monopoly of conversion to the Chief Rabbinate and affects thousands of Jews who have been converted in recent years placing them into alternative tracks that the Israeli establishment does not recognize.\nThe decisions of the Israeli government are equivalent to turning a blind eye to the strategic challenge of connecting Diaspora youth to the Jewish people and the State of Israel. These government decisions directly affect the ability of the young to view Israel as their home. Needless to say, government decisions also undermine the efforts to recruit and train Jewish students to protect Israel from BDS supporters on campuses.\nThe media frequently indicated the potentially damaging effect on the level of support from the Diaspora Jews through their donations, however, in our opinion, this is not the main thing. The unfortunate government decisions on June 25th directly affect our common future as a nation, the security and economic interests of the State of Israel, and the original purpose of the State for the Jewish Nation.\nWe stand a few days before the seventeenth of Tammuz, and it is our duty to remind you that because of hatred, the Temple was destroyed twice. We stand before you, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu and every member of the government, demanding that you recognize the seriousness of this matter and act decisively to cancel the government\u2019s June 25th decisions.\nTo celebrate Shabbat during 100 Days // 100 Ways, we asked fifth graders at Bet Shalom and their \u201ctwin\u201d classroom at the Hadarim school, in our sister-city of Rehovot, Israel to draw us images of Shabbat.\nBelow view a gallery of images from the Bet Shalom students. Stay tuned for more images, this time from Rehovot!\nMinneapolis Jewish Federation is paired with the city of Rehovot, Israel as part of the Parntership2Gether program through the Jewish Agency for Israel. This partnership is in its second full year and has recently begun implementing exciting programming in both the Minneapolis and Rehovot Jewish communities.\nOne program of the Minneapolis/Rehovot P2G is a school classroom \u201ctwinning.\u201d Twinning programs promote the sense of Jewish Peoplehood and shared responsibility. Students have the chance to meet each other and have dynamic conversations around issues such as Jewish identity and social responsibility.\nYou\u2019ll see these and more on our Facebook page every Friday. Be sure to check out the rest of our 100 Days events and posts on Twitter as well as on our website.\nThanks to technology, we are able to bring two synagogues, with a deep love of learning, together.\nBeginning November 17, Congregation Darchei Noam in St. Louis Park will begin simultaneous study sessions with synagogue The Berman Shul in Rehovot, Israel.\nThe six classes will be held on Tuesday evenings, the Minneapolis group meets at Darchei Noam at 7PM and on Sundays at 11AM. The following Sunday the groups will gather via Skype in Minnesota and Israel to discuss what they learned and share insights.\nThese classes are free and open to the community. The schedule is below, and we hope to see you there!\nThe #\u200eMomentummn\u202c delegation of the\u202a#\u200eMOMentumtrips\u202c of women visited Rehovot on Tuesday, October 27th as a part of our Partnership2Gether program through the municipality of Rehovot, the Jewish Agency and the Minneapolis Jewish Federation.\nThe visit was hosted and sponsored by Rehovot\u2019s Deputy Mayor, Zohar Blum, and David Ashkenazi, Rehovot\u2019s Chief of Staff and Head of Foreign Relations Department.\nThe group spent the day touring the city (Weisman Institute and the Ayalon Institute), visiting kindergartens and early childhood care facilities in Kiryat Moshe as well as a little bit of shopping.\nThe highlight of the visit was dinner at the Minkov Citrus Orchard Museum along with Rehovot members of the partnership\u2019s Steering Committee which is Co-Chaired by Dr. Yoram Blachar.\nThe meeting between members of the Steering Committee and the women from the Minneapolis community was successful, exciting and left a taste and desire for further development of the relationship.\nFun fact: Melanie Ginsburg, a MASA Israel student from Minneapolis on a Teachers Fellows program in Rehovot, spoke with the group while they were there about how Federation supports Masa (which is also a Jewish Agency for Israel program), and about what she is doing in Rehovot.\nDozens of members of the Minneapolis Jewish community are scheduled to visit Rehovot in the upcoming months to continue establishing relationships and friendships with the residents of Rehovot.\nWe helped to build Israel. Today we help keep it strong.\nFor more than six decades, we\u2019ve helped strengthen the State of the Israel. And our commitment continues. Unwavering.\nFederation is dedicated to ensuring that all of Israel\u2019s citizens have equal access to educational and economic opportunity. And we work tirelessly to deepen connections between the Jewish State and the global Jewish community.\nDespite Israel\u2019s economic success, one in five Israeli families lives in poverty. We provide a safety net for the most vulnerable, and we advocate for those in distress.\nWhen Israel is threatened, we mobilize our networks at home and overseas to come immediately to her aid.\nThat global connection is fostered by immersive experiences for young Jews and programming that brings Israel to life in communities throughout North America.\nFederation has helped millions of immigrants move to Israel and start new lives\u201426,000 in the past year alone.\nThousands of elderly benefit from innovative services they receive right in their homes. Thousands of poor families know their children will have a brighter future thanks to our Federation-supported programs. Job training programs tackle high unemployment among the one million Israelis with disabilities.\nThe money we raise during times of crisis helps keeps Israelis safe during conflicts and funds post-trauma counseling for tens of thousands living on the front lines.\nAnd we\u2019ve helped hundreds of thousands of young Jews forge a personal connection to Israel through programs like Taglit-Birthright Israel, and built strong relationships between communities in Israel and North America through Partnership2Gether\u2014 including our partner city, Rehovot.\nWe stand by Israel\u2019s side. Always.\nWhile you can\u2019t prevent further escalation in the violence in Israel, you can deliver swift assistance to the victims through the Jewish Agency for Israel\u2019s Fund for Victims of Terror.\nBecause of your gift, victims of the horrifying terrorist attacks happening throughout Israel will receive assistance quickly\u2014often within 24 hours\u2014so they can start the process of healing.",

    "text": "The Siemens Drive Technologies Group in Elk Grove Village, IL, introduces the Simotion PAC machine controller, designed to handle the entire monitoring and control process, including PLC logic, motion control, drive control, motion safety, robotics control and PID control for elements such as force and pressure regulation. Not only does this greatly minimize panel space and wiring, but it also simplifies (and sometimes eliminates) field-bus configuration.\nProgramming in an object-oriented environment allows Simotion to convert from running a third-party drive to running a Siemens Sinamics drive with no changes to the user-code. All that\u2019s required is to reconfigure the axis object to communicate with the Sinamics drive for quick, easy retrofitting. Additionally, metalformers need not direct hardware addresses, as everything is referenced by name and Simotion handles the hardware-address allocations automatically (I/O is optional).\nAnother benefit of handling all machine control functions in a PAC is that the metalformer need not synchronize multiple hardware components. For example, there is no need to pass information such as axis position to the PLC to calculate new setpoints that then must be sent back down to the drive. This simplifies the user code and improves machine response times. Metalforming applications for the controls include transfer presses, blanking lines and hydraulic and mechanical presses.",

    "text": "Stumped here... I have carpet moisture at the interior corner of my LR slide on my 2005 Essex. @ The storage drawer under the U dinette closest to the TV hutch. Nothing underneath the drawer, nothing under the dining table. Just a 12\u201d area. Checked for bathroom leaks as it backs up to the hutch. Nada. No moisture in basement. Slide topper intact. Rubber slide seal in good shape. No visible water accumulation under the slide exterior mechanism. Thanks in advance for any thoughts!\nIn the slide out? Do you have a fridge on that side? My icemaker water line goes thru the slide and there is a shut off valve below in the basement storage.\nIf you have a window in that area it may be that the window has a bad seal (the seal/adhesive when it was installed) and water is getting into your interior wall and depositing on the area in question.\nI had the same thing happen. It was a loose water line connection under the sink which was quite a bit away, but water travels.\nWhich floor plan (model number)?\nThanks for the replies! Model is 4502 Somerset. Sink area dry.\nSo, you have the dinette on the driver side slide and kitchen on the passenger slide. Reefer in the hall passenger side....correct?\nSo, is your wet spot under the hutch (fixed/not on slide) or within the slide dinette corner?\nOur 4502, when I bring in the driver slide after/during a rain, will drain water that was dumped on the slide roof onto the floor which will cause the water to flow under the hutch. The water appears shortly after driving away due to acceleration ... the water that was trapped on the slide roof flows off the slide end (which is now inside the RV). If I brake hard, the water will go the other way and shows up between the forward slide end and the driver's chair. We just mop with a paper towel since it only occurs under the described circumstances. BTW, we have full tile flooring and the funky \"nightclub\" dinette.\nThe other thing to check is the floor drains ... they are located under the base of the \"columns\" at the ends of the slides. You can see them when the slide is pulled in. Sometimes they will have debris.\nWill check it out\u2026 Thanks!",

This bluff offers hiking trails with stunning views as well as Rainbow Trout up to 3 pounds and Bull Trout up to 10 pounds.\nThe jagged mountain peaks of the Chilcotin are covered in vast ice fields and wide alpine meadows, gradually softening into large valleys, gently rolling foothills, pine covered forests, lakes and rivers and the grasslands of the Chilcotin Plateau.\nThis is essentially backcountry at its best complete with some of the best fishing lakes and rivers to be found in North America. The expansive Chilcotin lies between the Fraser River and Coast Mountains, a 5,000 square kilometre plateau of rangeland, where thousands of cattle roam unfenced land.\nHistory : History on the Chilcotin area can be found on the Visit the West Chilcotin website.",

    "text": "As a Cardinals rookie in 1962, first baseman Fred Whitfield was one of the best power-hitting prospects the franchise had produced in years.\n\u201cHe has a quicker bat than anyone on the Cardinals and he can reach the roof at Busch Stadium,\u201d coach Vern Benson told The Sporting News.\nThe Sporting News hailed Whitfield as the Cardinals\u2019 \u201cbiggest surprise of 1962\u201d and Whitfield was selected by big-league managers, coaches and players as the first baseman on the 1962 Topps all-star rookie team.\nSigned by Cardinals scout Mercer Harris, Whitfield was a standout in the minor leagues. He hit .309 with 23 home runs for Keokuk in 1958; .285 with 28 homers for Winston-Salem and Tulsa in 1959; .310 with 22 homers for Tulsa in 1960; and .301 with 18 homers for Charleston in 1961.\nHe was batting .323 and leading the International League in home runs (eight) and RBI (28) when he was promoted to the Cardinals on May 26, 1962.\nThe Cardinals were seeking a right-handed batter to replace injured outfielder Minnie Minoso. Because of a weak throwing arm after he hurt his shoulder as an American Legion pitcher, Whitfield only could play first base. Unlike Minoso, he batted left-handed.\nAccording to The Sporting News, it was Cardinals business manager Art Routzong who convinced general manager Bing Devine and manager Johnny Keane to promote Whitfield.\nIn his first five pinch-hit appearances for the Cardinals, Whitfield produced three hits and a walk.\nWhitfield finished the 1962 season with a .266 batting average, eight home runs and 34 RBI in 158 at-bats for the Cardinals. He hit .333 as a pinch-hitter and .412 with two outs and runners in scoring position. He was especially effective versus the Phillies, batting .313 with 13 RBI in 12 games.\n\u201cFred did an exceptionally good job, especially as a pinch-hitter and part-time player, jobs usually handled by older, experienced men,\u201d Devine said.\nHowever, Whitfield became expendable because White, who batted left-handed, was entrenched at first base, and the Cardinals needed pitching.\nOn Dec. 15, 1962, the Cardinals dealt Whitfield to the Indians for pitcher Ron Taylor and infielder Jack Kubiszyn.\nWhitfield hit 20 or more home runs three times for the Indians (21 in 1963, 26 in 1965 and 27 in 1966). In a nine-year major-league career (1962-70), he played for the Cardinals, Indians, Reds and Expos, batting .253 with 108 home runs.",

    "text": "Investing money has been a source of debate among Christians for centuries. Some say that investing is unbiblical and any extra surplus should be given to the needy, while others argue that investing must be a part of every Christian's financial plan. In this post, we will address these and other issues concerning Christian investing.\nThe first topic that needs to be considered is whether investing is or is not scriptural. As in many cases, the answer depends on the situation. Anyone investing because of greed (Luke 12:15), to get rich quick (Proverbs 23:4-5), or to massage his ego (Proverbs 29:23) is not participating in biblically-based investing. On the other hand, those who are acting as good stewards as in Luke 19:12-27 or those who are saving for future needs such as college or retirement (Proverbs 6:6-8) are participating in biblical investing. In the end, it all depends on the attitude, which is ultimately determined by God. Remember, \"All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord.\" (Proverbs 16:2).\nThe greater the potential return, the greater the risk. (Proverbs 27:12) This is a fact of economic life. If someone has a \"no risk\" investment that generates 25% each year, stay away from him. Either he's deranged or lying.\nDiversify your investments. (Ecclesiastes 11:2) Diversification is essential to long-term stability. If one investment goes down, another you have can offset it by going up. In short, this is just another way of saying \"don't put all of your eggs in one basket\".\nBe sure you understand the investment you are considering. (Proverbs 24:3-4) You are God's steward, and you need to understand how it will be used. If you don't understand, then don't invest.\nDon't risk money you can't afford to lose. (Ecclesiastes 5:13-14) If losing the money your are investing would cause financial ruin, family stress, or any other major problem, then do not invest it in a risky place. A safe investment such as federal government bonds would be more appropriate in this case.\nDon't make a quick decision -- take time to think and pray. (Psalm 37:7) Stop and consider what you are doing. Once again, you are God's steward, and you need to handle His money appropriately.\nIn addition, you'll need to determine your goals -- what you want to accomplish -- before you invest. Since this is different for every person, it is impossible to provide specific direction that will apply to everyone. However, there are some general topics that you will want to consider. These include your age, income, and temperament. See the investment section of this blog for articles that may help you in this area.\nMy advice is to find a successful, Christian advisor who can not only recommend good investments but add biblically-based advice. If you can't find a good Christian advisor, go to a good non-Christian advisor (of course, you'll have to weigh his advice in accordance with biblical principles). While some may scoff at this suggestion, think if it was a brain surgeon instead. Would you rather have a top-notch non-Christian or an average Christian operate on you? I think you get the point.\nEither way, you need to get good counsel from a variety of sources as \"plans fail for a lack of counsel, but with many advisors they succeed.\" (Proverbs 15:22). Rest assured that if you need wisdom in this area, you can ask God, and He will provide it. (James 1:5).\nI find it odd that none of your mentions of Christian investing discusses the morality of the investments you make. I don't think that it is important to use the bible to decide investing strategies. However, I think that the bible has much to say about supporting immoral companies. Investing in Altria may be a good dividend play, but I can't make money from something that causes death. Other companies, such as Caterpillar or pay-day loan companies, may operate in gray areas. With these companies, it is up to you, during your stock research to decide if the moral line has been crossed. In the end, Christian investing is about finding companies and ventures that don't violate your values, not investing strategies.\nGood to find this site. There isnt all that much on out there on the relationship of our faith to business.\nDo you mean how do you subscribe to this blog?\nThis just goes to Prove the saying \"...you can Prove Anything with a misquote/misuse of the Bible\". If YOU want to know how to survive without cash, day-to-day, you Have to be Realistic...Not as the World Sees it; but, as Christ said it. The Short-cut Is: 1.Give it all away; and then 2.Ask the Father to show you/support your needs; and then 3.Wait for His directions to you. It is easier if you First learn as a child, how to wait on Him; and, how to take orders (obey) from Him. This Proceedure has Nothing to do with Religion and nothing to do with Any Preacher. It is Christian. But, prior to being Christian, this is how the Ancients' survived...by obediance to the Almighty Creator of the Universe. By the way, since He knows your needs Better than you do, you will be very surprised. Others, who don't know your 'secret' won't believe you either. AND, the less you 'fret' about your situation, the richer you get and richer you appear to be. You do pay Income taxes on any income....such as a job, or inheritance.\nThank you so very much for this article and for your blog. I need a lot of help with financial things and being a Christian, I would like to ensure I am handling my finances, etc. biblically! This is wonderful! May God continue to bless you!\nvery sound biblical info! It's good to know that individuals still use the scriptures to please God in all they do when it comes to non-moral issues such as investing. I want to start investing in some mutual-funds and any wisdom I can get will be beneficial in this process as I seek to leave an inheritance for my children. Thank you!\nHi, I own a mortgage cmpany and I'm haveing a diffcult time getting people to embrace doing there job in more of a servant attitude than a profit attitude. Do anyone have any pointers on how to refocus the mindset of my office.\nPeople make choices every day - where they work, where they spend and donate money...yet many do not consider the moral implications of invetsing. Do your investments match your values? If you are a Christian, do your investments oppose your Faith? Through your investments, you may be supporting the adult entertainment industry, abortion industry, or supporting the homosexual agenda. Take the time to find out where you are invetsing and make changes.\nhi. well lets see, profiting from mortgages is sin. Let me explain...the Bible says that the borrower is the slave to the lender. when you issue mortgages, you are affectively enslaving people til death...and you want God to bless that?",

Neither do they deny that he was released without any charge.\nMrs Chigodora said the police officers confirmed knowing Mr Mbofana prior to the arrest and where he stayed, hence there was no justification in raiding him at midnight.\n\u201cMore so, if defendants wanted to interview the plaintiff, I see no reason why they had to take him at midnight considering that they admitted they only looked for him once in the afternoon and failed to find him,\u201d she said.\nThis comes after Constable Tafara Depute of Zimunya Police Station, who brutally assaulted a villager and subjected him to unlawful arrest and detention, will, for the next 10 months, have $100 deducted from his monthly salary to pay up damages of $1 007.\nA Mutare man Mr Samson Jackson, who was once arrested at Zimunya Police Station for insulting some Zanu-PF officials, sued the policeman after being brutally assaulted.\nIn a related case, a Bindura University student Mr Luckson Munyai is suing the police for $51 503 after he was assaulted and broke an arm.\nHe sued then Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi, Commissioner General Augustine Chihuri, Inspector Mutizwa and Sergeant Nleya in their official capacities.\nThe case is yet to be set down for hearing at the High Court.",

The country is politically very unstable.\nThe Reform message entered the country in 1939 with Pastor Carlos Kozel\u2019s visit; and one year later, in 1940, two Peruvian missionaries (Brothers Jos\u00e9 Carmen Le\u00f3n and Heraclio Begazo) were sent to work in the country. By 1943 there were 30 interested souls attending church services. After the first church was organized in the capital city of La Paz, the message was taken to most cities. On December 23, 1963, the Bolivian Field of the Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement was legally registered as a missionary fields of the General Conference with its headquarters in Germany at the time.\nIn 1975, the General Conference put the Bolivian Field under the management of the Peruvian Union; and then in 1986 Bolivia once again became a missionary field under the General Conference.\nFrom January 1992 to 1995, when there were already 324 members, the church had a collapse that brought about great difficulties. Only 205 members remained firm in the true faith. Due to this problem, the work started over with three churches, one vehicle, and 10% of the publications of the publishing house. The situation was very precarious.\nBut now, thanks to God and the sacrifices made by local and foreign Bible workers and pastors, the Bolivian Field has 317 members and was recently organized as a Union. Although it is weak financially, some donations and the cooperation of our brethren have made it possible for the Union to purchase a piece of land measuring 1,700 square meters (18,299 square feet) in the city of Cochabamba for the purpose of constructing a headquarters building.\nWe appeal to all the believers in the world to help us carry out our construction plans, for we cannot do this by ourselves. As it is written, \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d Acts 20:35. \u201cSelf-denial will bring into the treasury of God the means necessary to advance His work. Thus we may act in copartnership with Christ.\u201d \u2013In Heavenly Places, p. 300.\nMay your offerings be very special for the work of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We pray that He will multiply what you generously give for His cause in this place.",

Because of their height, the windmills reflect other radio and television signals towards the Lofar station.\nMinister for economic affairs Henk Kamp has a year to decide whether to continue with the project. The plan has already been criticized by local residents and municipalities.\nThe Dutch telecom agency is currently looking into whether windmills interfere with radio telescope operation in Drenthe.\nMinister Kamp gave the project the go-ahead based on a study by a British company, which found that the operation of the telescope would not suffer if windmills were placed nearby. However, Astron argues that the British researchers didn\u2019t have sufficient knowledge to make that claim.\nAstronomers at the Lofar site would prefer if the windmills were at least 15km away from the telescope. The current plan would see seven of the fifty turbines placed within a 15km radius of the Lofar site.\n\u2018It might not sound like too much of a difference, but going from a few kilometres to fifteen really makes a big difference when it comes to the strength of the reflected signals,\u2019 said Garrett.",

    "text": "Siemens has developed a navigation system with a three-dimensional map display. These true-to-life images of entire streets and intersections make it easier for drivers to find their destinations even in unfamiliar urban areas. The system will be launched on the market in mid 2008.\nIn contrast to systems commonly used today, this new navigation system from Siemens VDO Automotive displays different levels at highway interchanges. To ensure better orientation in cities, digitized images of eye-catching structures will be integrated into the system. With just the push of a button, users will also be able to call up on their displays tourist information, such as the opening times, admission prices and telephone numbers of museums, theaters and other attractions. By the planned start of mass production, this information service will cover 100 of the largest cities in Europe.\nRegarding the large volumes of data, the system runs from a hard disc. Superimposition of four different digital maps makes this three-dimensional navigation possible. The basis is formed by a digital terrain model that gives the gradient of the land with its high and low points. Superimposed over this model are digitized satellite photos. Another layer consists of digitalized 3D-buildings and contours of buildings which the system uses to generate three-dimensional views of cities. Finally, a digital street map \u2013 like today\u2019s navigation maps \u2013 completes the picture.\nAnd the system will also be a hit with drivers of off-road vehicles: The terrain model also displays areas away from the main road network, so the system can calculate routes through wooded areas and fields. The navigation process automatically takes this data into account for cross country drives. An advanced version of the system is already in the planning stages. Soon, a camera installed on a vehicle\u2019s front will record and digitize images of traffic lights and traffic signs, which will appear in synchronization in the navigation display.",

    "text": "Music | Delmarie Hines: My Journey. My Story.\nI must ask you to stick with me on this one. It\u2019s a bit of a winding road.\nMusic has always played a major role in my life and the life of my family. My memories of my childhood are full of music. Lately, I have been enjoying vivid memories of the songs my parents sang to me as lullabies. I am the youngest of 4 children. My older siblings were all involved in music. Someone was always learning a song, a solo, an audition piece, practicing for band rehearsal, choir rehearsal, ensemble rehearsal, piano lessons, or just jamming some 8-track, 45, LP, or tape. Mom was preparing music for Sunday morning worship. Dad was singing some hymn that was in his heart. I was just singing, singing, singing. I loved singing more than talking and that\u2019s saying a lot because I LOVED to talk. I had a terrible stutter as a child. I had to attend speech therapy sessions in elementary school. I had to learn to slow my mind down so that my mouth could catch up. Singing is what my therapist and parents used to help me learn to slow my thoughts down. Stuttering never got in the way of singing. I could close my eyes, see the beautiful colors and patterns and just siiiiiiiinnnnnnnggggg my little heart out. Another trick was that my father would put his hand on my chest and tell me to breathe and then we\u2019d sing together. Dad had a great big tenor voice. I learned to remember that feeling when I would get frustrated or stuck on a word. To this day, putting my hand on my chest forces me to breathe deeply. Dad would often have me read something to him, slowly. He had me convinced that I was reading slowly because he needed to hear it slowly. My mother would gently put one hand on my forehead and her other on my back. That would make me stop, breathe, think and try again. Mom\u2019s trick was to have me read something from her medical journals. That forced me to slow down because I had to sound out all of those complicated medical words. Now I just put my hand on my forehead when I need to stop, breathe, think and try again. My brother, David, would hold me and sing to me or read to me when I got angry or upset. Music and reading were my safe places. My family made them so. My sister, Charmaine, who was my arch enemy in childhood, was also one of my favorite singers. My brother, Milton, my other childhood enemy, could sing like Stevie Wonder and I loved it. I tried not to let it show but I think they both knew that I LOVED to hear them sing.\nMy mother made everything she sang sound sweet. She was THE alto\u2026.one of those people simply born to sing alto! Hearing her sing in the kitchen was one of my joys in life. Even way back then, we connected through music in ways that needed no words.\nPeople would come to our house to practice their parts and solos with my mother during her years of directing the Sanctuary Choir and serving as the Minister of Music at church. Seeing my mother\u2019s beautiful smile when they sang correctly was everyone\u2019s goal (that arched eyebrow when the part wasn\u2019t right was to be avoided at all costs). One thing she knew for sure. I was going to know my part and be able to tell her who was in my section and not singing correctly. As the youngest child, being a snitch was sort of an art form for me. LOL. My mother and I did a lot of talking. There was a lot to learn. She taught me how to cook\u2026and especially how to cook for Dad. She taught me how to assist Dad and her in their careers and the work they did in partnership. She taught me how to be a lady and a woman. She taught me how to read, write, and edit with an eye for detail and thirst for depth. She taught me how to be a woman in a leadership role especially when I was the only woman and/or the only person of color in the room. She taught me about the power of words and the need to tread lightly at times\u2026never as a sign of weakness but as a sign of strength, wisdom, maturity and submission to God.\nHere we are at 2017 and my mother is slipping away from me and I\u2019m grasping at straws to hold on to her. The woman whose counsel I depended on heavily can no longer have a meaningful conversation with me. The woman whose dry wit could make me laugh hard is now difficult for me to understand. I find myself approaching conversations with her as I did with my nieces, nephews, and godchildren when they were little. My mother\u2019s facial expressions let me know that in her mind she makes perfect sense, so I do my best to figure it out. She still makes me laugh. At times she gives me that look that lets me know that she no more understands what she is saying than I do. She also has her moments of clarity when she\u2019ll hit me with one of her witty zingers. I give her the side-eye and we both giggle. My mother, a brilliant, deeply spiritual, witty woman with a vocabulary that often sent me running to the Oxford Dictionary (some of the words could not be found in Webster\u2019s dictionary) is slipping away. That ferocious insatiable beast called Alzheimer\u2019s is annihilating her beautiful mind. We are now 5 years into her diagnosis and the years are taking their toll. Since words are difficult for us, we share music\u2026often. We especially share music in the still of the wee hours, when sleep escapes both of us and she calls out for her mother. We hum, listen to music, connect in ways that do not require either of us to try to understand the other. We simply share our love of the vibrations and power of music. I want to keep the music playing. I want to keep connecting. I need to keep the music playing. As a child I learned to turn to music when words were difficult for me to utter. Now I turn to music as an adult as words are becoming difficult for my mother to utter. Music\u2026it\u2019s been there for me my whole life and I pray that the music never ends.\nThis song is about two lovers but with the change of just a few words, it\u2019s applicable to my relationship with my mother. This may seem weird to some, but it\u2019s perfect for Mom and me.\nEach time you hear her name?\nAre you brave enough to confess that you are afraid to trust God? Are you beat down enough to admit that you are afraid to trust God? Are you afraid to trust God? I confess that I have been, I am, and I am hoping to stop this cycle. Trust has been a major issue for me overall. As I\u2019ve stated before, my trust issues went into overdrive when my father died suddenly. I clung to the belief for YEARS that God had made an error and was simply too embarrassed to admit it. I can kinda laugh about that whole way of thinking now but there is still a part of me that is open to accept God\u2019s apology for ruining my life! LOL I let that pain fester and grow into a deep lack of trust for anything that made no sense to me, that could not be documented, or that materialized outside of what I found logical even if not my taste. All along though I still acknowledged God, loved God, and kinda sorta served God (insert side-eye here). There is no way to fully serve God without trusting God. There is actually no way to be engaged in a healthy loving relationship with ANYONE without trust.\nTrusting God requires passion and commitment. I\u2019m not just trusting God to hold my hand as I cross the street. I\u2019m trusting God to BE THE PATH. I\u2019m trusting God to reveal my future and guide me as I do what God says do. I\u2019m trusting God to be my everything. The trick though is that I have to give up all of my notions of who and how I should be. THAT\u2019S MAJOR! This must be why God sent His Son, Jesus, to be our example. This trusting God thing takes sacrifice and not just giving up Ben and Jerry\u2019s for Lent. It requires giving up your life so that you can live. It requires seeing God in everyone. It requires knowing the will and Word of God. It requires embracing a love that is not always cuddly, but a love that disciplines, that corrects, that cuts to the bone, that sheds blood, that comes with HIGH accountability. That kind of love demands and breeds passion and commitment. Now that I think about it, the question is not just will I TRUST God, it\u2019s also do I LOVE God. Do I love God enough to TRULY surrender all of me to all of Him?\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve blogged. There are many reasons for that but we can discuss those later. Today I just wanna talk and hopefully hear back from you.\nThis whole exploration of trust started here. There is a note in my mother\u2019s medical file that states: \u201cFailure to thrive\u201d\u20263 little words\u2026just 3 little words. Her doctor mentioned the possibility of cancer being the reason she is failing to thrive. If I didn\u2019t have a tight budget I would have SMASHED my phone to make her and her words disappear. PLEASE NOTE: To those of you reading this who know my mother this is not a confirmed diagnosis. At this point it\u2019s just an exploration of what is causing her \u201cfailure to thrive.\u201d The tears came quickly\u2026tears of anger, confusion and fear all at the same time. Have you ever been there? It\u2019s a painful place to be. It\u2019s a lonely place to be. It\u2019s also an easy place to get off track in every way possible. This question quickly came to mind, \u201cWho and what will I trust?\u201d I am a Christian so that question more specifically for me is will I trust God to be God?\nTHAT IS A HUGE QUESTION!!!\nI knew that I needed to run to God but it was more like confront God. I was angry. I wanted to let God know a thing or two about the way my journey is playing out. My prayer time was not focused on miraculous healing for my mother. I have laid her at the altar before God and I am caring for her to the best of my abilities. There is nothing more that I can do than that. God is a healer and that remains true no matter what. I heard or read this recently, \u201cEveryone who God heals also eventually dies!\u201d With that in mind, I was ready to let God have it. Unexpectedly though, my prayer time was not focused on my anger or my list of grievances against God. My prayer time was focused on trust.\nThe question I wrestled and am wrestling with is will I trust God no matter what? This is not some undefined trust. I\u2019m talking about a trust that shows up as an unconditional yes to whatever God asks of me. A trust that shows up as unconditional and full surrender to God over what I want. A trust that shows up as obedience to God. A trust that shows up as complete, irrevocable, absolute submission to God. I am clear that I\u2019m using words that many like to steer clear of these days. I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s now. My need for popularity and to be one of the cool kids ended a LONG time ago! I want an intimate and powerful relationship with God\u2026a relationship that gives God glory. I want to be a disciple of God. Those goals require trusting God.\nAnyone who knows me knows that I am a fan of embracing reality. Today\u2019s challenge was to embrace the reality that God\u2019s will can be and at times will be painful for me. This pain is in direct correlation to my desire to have what I want, the way want it, when I want it. God\u2019s will is my joy only if I die daily and in Him alone live, breathe and have my being. We get to heavy blowing, running, shouting, dancing, speaking in tongues and whatnot when we declare that. The truth of the strength and courage of this conviction though is revealed when life smacks you in the face with a brick or your own choices lead you to run at full speed into a brick wall. Well I\u2019ve been smacked and I got angry with God. That anger surprised me. I went all the way back to things that happened in high school and went down the list of the times I felt that God had disappointed me, forgotten me, abandoned me. When I stepped into the Prayer Room today the anger left and I was left to struggle with trusting God. I cried\u2026and I\u2019m still crying. I recited scripture. I talked with God. I heard from God. I listened to music. I sang. I cried some more. The thing that I am most clear about is that my mother will be fine. The work I have to focus on is me and my relationship with God.\nIt\u2019s not over. I\u2019m still processing. What gets you through your battles in life? How do you let go of anger? How do you turn life\u2019s circumstances into opportunities to grow closer to God? Do you trust God to be God? What does that question mean to you? Let\u2019s pray for each other as we navigate through this thing called life. Let\u2019s talk about trust.",

    "text": "Report for 1870--The old \"gym\"--Continued financial stringency--College journalism--President Twombly elected--Report for 1871--Ladies' Hall opened--A plea for the land-grant--First tax levy--Raising the standard--Report for 1873--Resignation of Dr. Twombly.\nIn their report for the year ending September 30, 1870, the regents express regret for their non-success, thus far, in filling the vacant presidential chair; but \"it is extremely gratifying to be able to say, that the place has been most ably filled temporarily, by the honored Vice President,\" Professor Sterling. There has been a slight diminution in the aggregate attendance of students, which \"finds abundant explanation in the stringency of the times, and the low price of farm productions. Many sons and daughters of farmers have been compelled, from this cause, to omit for a time their course of studies. Another cause may be found in the higher requirements for admission to the preparatory department and the more thorough examinations for admission, from which have come many rejections of applicants. The inability of the University to furnish rooms is still a drawback--for the price of board and rooms in the city is beyond the reach of many excellent students.\"\nThey further state that a frame building for \"drill and gymnastic exercises,\" containing as well an armory, and an office for the military instructor, has just been completed on the brow of the hill, northwestward of the main hall, at a cost of about $4,000; 1 which leaves at our disposal much room in University Hall, before occupied for military drill.\" It seems that this separate provision for the military department was \"made on the urgent recommendation\" of Col. Walter S. Franklin, the army officer detailed to fill the chair of military science and engineering; but Colonel Franklin had, after that, been withdrawn, and the board, feeling that the exigencies of the army service threaten to keep the military school in a state of uncertainty, are considering the advisability of paying \"the expenses of this professorship from the funds of the University, in order to secure permanency in instruction.\"\nAs fast as these lands are called for, they are sold at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre and the working of this system has no other effect than to realize for the University the lowest possible price for its endowment lands. We wish authority to withhold a portion of the best of these lands from market until the development of the regions where they are located will enable us to dispose of them at a far greater price. Had such a course been adopted on the organization of the University, we should now have had an ample endowment, and been saved the necessity of begging at the doors of the State Councils for the meagre sums necessary to make the institution one of even reasonable usefulness.\nAn important event of the year 1870 was the issue, in June, of the first number of The University Press, of which George W. Raymer and James W. Bashford were editors and publishers; its columns were to be \"always open to scientific, literary, and general news articles, written by the students, the professors, and the friends of the University.\" The Press was a monthly throughout 1870, and then appeared semi-monthly until September, 1882, when it became a weekly, continuing as such to the close of its very useful career. Its first rival was the weekly Campus appearing in October, 1881; after two months of existence, the Campus became the Badger, which was merged in the Press in September, 1885; that in turn was merged in the Aegis, October of the following year. The Aegis, at first a weekly, became a bi-weekly in September, 1892; and the literary monthly of the University, in October, 1895. The Daily Cardinal first appeared in April, 1892, and enjoys the reputation of being one of the best college dailies in the country.\nAt the opening of the University, in September, 1839, two new college publications made their first appearance. The Sphynx, an illustrated humorous bi-weekly, upon the plan of the Harvard Lampoon and papers of that character; and The Wisconsin Alumni Magazine, an illustrated monthly edited by Charles E. Allen, '99, Florence E. Baker, '91, and others--it is to be sent free to members of the Alumni association, and \"will be devoted to the dissemination of knowledge in regard to life at the University.\"\nAt the annual meeting of the regents in June, 1871, Rev. Dr. John H. Twombly,3 lately superintendent of the public schools of Charlestown, Mass., an educator and a Methodist divine of some note, was called to the presidency of the University, and to fill the chair of mental and moral philosophy. He entered upon his duties here at the beginning of the new college year, in September. In their annual report, the regents say that \"His high character, and long experience in collegiate and educational management, with his energy and practical knowledge, lead the Board to congratulate themselves and the University upon the good fortune which enabled them to place him at the head of the University.\"\nThe annual report of the regents for 1871 announces the election to the professorship of military science and civil engineering, of Maj. William J. L. Nicodemus,4 U. S. A., retired, at a salary of $1,200, paid by the board. This election, together with that of the new president, enables them to \"announce every department of the University in complete working order.\" The attendance of students in September of this year is greater than ever before, thus fully taxing the labors of the corps of instructors. \"The Regents have great satisfaction in reporting the utmost harmony in the Faculty, from highest to lowest, and a cordiality between teachers and students which has called forth a marked energy and progress in studies, and a general good conduct on the part of the students. * * * The college classes are above the average of former years, both in numbers and scholarship, while an unusually large number of the preparatory students are fitting for the regular courses. Every feature of the present points to a steady growth in numbers and widening usefulness.\"\nLadies' Hall was opened at the beginning of the school year 1871-72. \"The growing conviction in the public mind for many years back, that very many avocations might be fairly opened to women, who had thus far in the history of the race been debarred from them, has borne fruit,\" say the regents, \"in a liberal acquiescence to woman taking her place in the acquisition and practice of some of the scientific professions. Instructions have been given to carry out a system of education for the Female College, which, while it opens every department of the University to both sexes alike, yet leaves to the choice of the lady students as ambition or taste may dictate--to pursue in their own college under lady teachers--or with the regular college classes, the studies in which they desire full accomplishment * * * a conservative course, midway between the theories of those who would ride a hobby to personal popularity, and that of fogyism which yields nothing to the demands of a growing public opinion.\"\nA plea for the land-grant.\nThese lands amount to something over 200,000 acres, and are located almost entirely in the northern portion of the State. The present and prospective development of the northern counties, by the building of a network of railroads, will tend greatly to enhance the value of these lands. Must these lands all be sold at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre, when a few years will so immensely increase their original value? If from the original endowment grants by Congress, there had been reserved until now, ten per cent of the lands, we should have had an endowment second to no college in the country. If we can now reserve twenty-five percent of the lands that remain of the grants, for a period of twenty years or so, a future generation of students will be able to reach all of the prosperity which the most sanguine friends of the University have ever hoped for it. Let not our posterity have to say of us that we ignored for them all the powers this generation holds in its hands, to lay broad and deep foundations for our University.\nWhereas, The university fund has suffered serious loss and impairment by such sales of its lands, so that its income is not at present sufficient to supply its wants, and cannot be made so by any present change of policy, inasmuch as the most valuable lands have already been sold; therefore, etc.\nThis was the first State tax levied for the benefit of the University. We shall see that in 1876 it was increased to a tenth of a mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of the state; and still farther increased, in 1883, to an eighth. In their report for 1872, the regents naturally express gratification at this promise of continuous state aid; they declare that the grant has \"met with such cordial approbation by the people * * * that no doubt now remains that a hearty and generous support by the State, in future, will meet with the earnest approval of all friends of education.\" There were, indeed, evidences on every hand that the people of Wisconsin had at last risen to an adequate appreciation of their state University. Nowhere in the newspaper press of the time do we find any note of dissatisfaction at the initial tax levy of 1872. The attendance had now grown to 600, including the preparatory department, and naturally the expenses of administration and instruction were growing. The timely appropriation had enabled the regents to purchase long-needed apparatus, books, laboratory conveniences, \"and what was of no less importance, the salaries of the hard-working professors and teachers were increased, placing them upon an equal footing with those of other colleges. This increase of salaries was necessary in order to retain some of our ablest professors, whose services were sought by higher salaries offered elsewhere.\"\nThe board report that they \"have had in view a gradual raising of the standard of admission and of scholarship, to such extent as eventually to do away entirely with the preparatory department. This result is steadily in progress of attainment, but must be done so gradually, without too greatly diminishing the number of students, as to give full employment to all professors and teachers.\" The regents have therefore secured the passage by the legislature of a law providing, conditionally, free tuition in the University to all graduates of high schools. \"The examination for admission to such students is such as must tend largely toward raising the standard of scholarship in these schools, and thus in great measure answer the purpose of preparatory schools. It also makes University education a prize within the reach of all high school students, and brings the University more completely before the people.\" During this year (1872), ten students have availed themselves of the privilege, and been admitted to the college classes. The following year, forty-eight students came from this source, with a corresponding diminution in the attendance on the preparatory department; in 1877 came the system of accredited high schools, now in vogue, and three years later (1880) the time had arrived for the abolition of the preparatory department.\nIn 1873, the board finds little of special moment upon which to report. The University is making good progress. \"The pressing demand for increased accommodations will soon compel the Regents to ask for increased income, or to rest content with an institution of limited facilities, following behind others in character and usefulness in sister States, whose patrons look with deeper interest upon the advantages which are offered for the education of their youth.\"\nThe past year has been one of substantial progress. The resignation of J. H. Twombly, as president, was accepted by the Regents on the 21st of January last. President John Bascom was invited to occupy the place, and entered on the discharge of his duties with the beginning of the spring term. The Regents are more than satisfied with the change, and do not hesitate to predict from it an effectual increase of good in the management of the University, and a far higher position for it among the colleges of the country.\nThe passing of President Twombly signalized the close of the childhood of the University. With the entrance of President Bascom, 6 the University may be considered as having come into possession of the full vigor of early manhood. No longer was it \"open to the charge of being little more than a respectable high school for Madison.\" 7 Henceforth it was not to be seriously affected by such vicissitudes as it had experienced in the past; it was at last felt to be a power in the State, the true head of the educational forces of the commonwealth, and with a splendid future before it.\n1 The old \"gym,\" an illy-constructed and poorly-equipped building, was destroyed by fire on the night of June 12, 1881.\n2 Professor Irving, a grandnephew of Washington Irving, was born in New York City, April 27, 1847. He graduated from Columbia College in 1866, and spent three years in post-graduate work in the school of Mines connected with that institution. For a time he was assistant geologist on the State survey of Ohio, and then metallurgist in smelting works at Greenville, N. J. He was holding this latter position when called to the University of Wisconsin. In 1873 he was appointed assistant geologist on the Wisconsin State survey, holding the position for six years in connection with his University chair. He was special agent for the 10th federal census, as expert on Lake Superior explorations; and in 1882 was placed in charge of the United States geological survey in the Northwestern States,--a position he held, also in connection with his University work, at the time of his death, May 30, 1888. He had won great distinction in his profession, being the first of the faculty of the Wisconsin University to attain a position among leading men of science. See an appreciative sketch of his character and career, by President Bascom, in Badger, 1890, pp. 187-190.\n3 Dr. Twombly was born in Rochester, N. H. He obtained his early education with difficulty, having to intersperse his studies with labor of various sorts-- carpentering, farming, and teaching. Finally, he graduated from the Wesleyan University at Middletown, Conn., in 1843. Being ordained a Methodist preacher, he at first taught in seminaries of his denomination; but from 1846 to 1866 was in charge of large congregations in different parts of Massachusetts. In 1855, he was chaplain of the Massachusetts senate; 1855-67, one of the overseers of Harvard College; 1857-71, secretary of the New England Education Society; 1868-69, director of the American Institute, and engaged in founding Boston University, of which he was a trustee. He had been upon the school boards of Worcester, Lynn, and Chelsea; and in 1866-70 was superintendent of the Charlestown public schools. Called to Wisconsin in June, 1851, he resigned January 21, 1874, and resumed his work in the ministry, going to Westfield, Mass.; later, he was at Springfield, and closed his career in charge of the Broadway Methodist church in Boston. His alma mater gave him the degree of M. A. in 1846, and D. D. in 1871.\n4 Born at Cold Springs, Va., August 1, 1834, graduating from West Point in 1858. As lieutenant in the Fifth Infantry, he took part in the Utah expedition, and again (1861) in the Navajo expedition. Commissioned captain in the Twelfth, in October, 1861, he was engaged until the following June as acting assistant adjutant-general of the Department of New Mexico. At the battle of Valverde (February 21, 1862), he was brevetted major. In October, 1862, he was commissioned colonel of the Fourth Maryland Volunteers, and guarded recruits at Baltimore. In February, 1863, he was assigned to the signal service, having charge of the communications between Harper's Ferry and Washington. Promoted major in that service for gallant conduct in pursuing the enemy through Maryland, he later became lieutenant-colonel. He was in charge of the signal bureau at Washington from October, 1863, to December, 1864, and in 1865 was made inspector in the corps, being finally restored to the Twelfth Infantry. During 1865-68, he was in garrison at New York, Richmond, and Washington; then for two years gave military instruction at Western University Pittsburg). Being honorably discharged in December, 1870, he afterward came to Wisconsin University, where he was soon appointed on the State geological survey, in addition to his duties as teacher. He died in Madison, while still a member of the faculty, January 6, 1879.\n5 The regents (Report 1872, p. 9) say that the legislature, \"through its committees on Education,\" made a thorough examination of the conditions and wants of the University; investigated the manner in which its grant of lands had been located and sold, and said committee arriving at the same conclusion [as ourselves] as to the cause of the waste of its productive fund ['that it was more important that these lands should be sold, and the country settled as rapidly as possible'], prepared and introduced a bill * * * [which], after due deliberation, was passed by both houses of the Legislature.\"\n6 President Bascom was born in Genoa, N. Y., May 1, 1827. He graduated from Williams College in 1849, and in 1855 from Andover Theological Seminary. In the same year he was chosen professor of rhetoric at Williams, and was holding that chair when called to the presidency of U. W. Resigning this post in 1887, he returned to Williams, of whose faculty he is still a member. Dr. Bascom has published numerous books, magazine articles, and addresses, and contributes largely to the leading critical reviews, his special fields being political economy and mental and moral philosophy. Amherst gave him the degree of LL. D. in 1873, and Grinnell (Iowa) that of D. D. in 1875.\n7 \"Board of Visitors' Report,\" 1874, in Report of Board of Regents for that year, p. 13.",

    "text": "Midweek Walks \u2013Wednesday 19 Sept 2018. Next walk: Thursday 18 October Askrigg.\nTaking heed of the long term weather forecast I had sent out a warning of my own to say that the walk to Bowlees- High Force and Low Force was probably not a safe idea. I did suggest that a low level walk might be a better option and with that in mind I planned catching the bus from Broken Scar, alighting at Gainford and then walking back to Broken Scar. I was not too surprised that there was nobody else at ED Walker Homes at 10.00 as several of my regulars had phoned to say that they had other arrangements. I decided that rather like The Windmill I would not close and consequently caught the X76 at 10.19 to Gainford. Several other walkers got out at Gainford but nobody seemed to be going my way. The Post Office in Gainford has closed so my thoughts of buying some Murray Mints to accompany me came to naught.\nI set off past the Doctors Surgery having noticed the mileage indicator on the wall near the bus stop \u2013 had not noticed that before \u2013 wonder which way they went to London ? perhaps over the Bridge at Piercebridge? Turning onto the Teesdale Way I passed the field were our friend \u2018Tom\u2019 kept his horses but no Tom nor his horses, just the little pony with diabetes \u2013 I hope that all is well ? The notices on our gates are well and nice and clean. The track beside the river has received some attention and it is now rather boxed in with fences on both sides all the way to Piercebridge. There seems to have been some clearing out of the undergrowth on the river side and the river views are really exquisite at times. Saplings have been planted and these are protected with sacking \u2013 they do not look to have taken very well \u2013 perhaps the dry weather ? I had hoped to have my elevenses at \u2018the seat\u2019 \u2013 you know the one opposite Snow Hall but there was a guy sitting there reading his paper \u2013 he said that he had been there for an hour \u2013 must have been a slow reader because his paper was the Daily Mirror!\nJust before Piercebridge there was evidence that some trees had been blown down but not with this storm because there were men cutting up the bigger branches. I crossed the road just before the bridge and walked down to where there are the remains of the Roman Town \u2013 I was going to have my elevenses in the town ruins but there was another man sitting on a seat here (No sign of the Daily Mirror) so I had to make do with a stone which was part of the walls. English Heritage have placed some information boards around the site and around the fields surrounding the site. I have never had time to read these before but spent time amusing myself looking at the writing and the illustrations. The pictures of the town and also the latrines were quite amusing.\nI have never had any problem getting from Piercebridge to High Conniscliffe before but today I could not find any route which did not have new notices claiming \u2013\u2018No Through Road \u2013 No cars\u2019. It was getting a bit windy so I decided to cut my losses and I accessed the road which was not too pleasant as there was a lot of traffic and a lot of dust being blown around. I am sure that there used to be the outlet to some sort of water pipe below the road at this point but I also failed to find that !! The clouds were building as I reached High Coniscliffe and I decided to lunch in the Church Lych-gate. Church of St Edwin \u2013 only one in England dedicated to this Christian King of Northumbria who was killed in 633 AD \u2013 well at least someone remembered him. It started to rain as I left High Coniscliffe so I put on my waterproof trousers and top \u2013 always difficult to get on trousers whilst wearing boots. No sooner had I got my trousers on than it stopped raining but the same cannot be said for the wind. The river beside the track was beautiful as it raced its way down towards the east coast. The track is also quite firm because of the long period of dry weather and I made quite good progress. The wind was really gusting as I went through the trees which are a feature of the walk at this point and falling leaves and small branches rained on me as I hurried along. I wonder why I met nobody \u2013 possibly because of the windy conditions. To my left I could see the A67 in the distance and there was Merrybent and at last the bridge below the A1(M) \u2013 I hoped that nobody would throw a bottle out of their car window as it passed \u2013 there did not seem to be much protection from the road.\nJust before Low Coniscliffe there are some woods and several of the trees have notices \u2013 one from the Darlington Trout Club declares that \u2018No Grayling to be killed\u2019 seems a bit extreme for a Government Minister of Transport. The wind was getting more damaging and the final bit of track before Low Coniscliffe was almost impassable because of fallen trees. Fortunately I knew where I was and I emerged through the final recently fallen tree just where the steps go up to meet the road in Low Coniscliffe. Just a couple of fields and then to the \u2018Baydale Beck\u2019 and then the main road back to Broken Scar not forgetting the Pumping Station which will open one weekend soon.",

    "text": "One of the remaining open challenges in Standard Model phenomenology is the formation of bound states of quarks in the strong coupling regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This is true in particular for the excited states of baryons (qqq-states). There is still room for improvement of our understanding, which is seen once predictions from constituent quark models or lattice QCD are confronted with information on baryon resonances extracted from experiment.\nFrom the experimental side, one studies baryon resonances by impinging strong or electromagnetic probes coming from manufacturable beams (pions, photons, electrons, . . .) on target nucleons in order to produce excited states. Then, the decay products are studied in order to infer the resonances. Thus, generally many different reactions are important for baryon spectroscopy.\nThe main currently accepted method to determine physical properties of resonances (masses, widths, quantum numbers, . . .) from data are so-called energy-dependent (ED) fits. Here, reaction-theoretic models construct the amplitude as a function of energy, and the model-parameters are (loosely speaking) varied in a fit. Then, the resulting amplitude is analytically continued into the complex energy plane to search for the resonance-poles. In almost all ED approaches, many reactions are analyzed at once in so-called coupled-channel fits.\nAn alternative Ansatz consists of trying to extract maximal information on reaction-amplitudes from the data, without introducing any kind of model-assumptions. For reactions involving particles with spin, e.g. \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c0N , \u03b3N \u2192 \u03c0N , eN \u2192 e'\u03c0N , . . ., generally n complex spin amplitudes are necessary to model-independently constraint the full reaction T-matrix. Furthermore, the data for such reactions consist of n2 measurable so-called polarization observables (or -asymmetries), which in general have to be measured in order to obtain information on amplitude-interferences. Thus, the question for an optimization of the measurement effort arises and one searches for so-called complete experiments. Those are minimal subsets of all measurable polarization observables sufficient in order to maximally constrain the underlying amplitudes. The complete experiment problem is most commonly treated as a purely mathematical problem, i.e. for idealized data with infinite precision.\nThis thesis treats the problem of complete experiments for the photoproduction of a single pseudoscalar meson \u03c6, with a recoil-baryon B in the final state: \u03b3N \u2192 \u03c6B. In this case, 4 complex amplitudes are accompanied by 16 polarization observables. The observables are again divided into the unpolarized differential cross section \u03c30, 3 single-spin asymmetries and 12 double-polarization observables which are again subdivided into the classes of beam-target (BT), beam-recoil (BR) and target-recoil (TR) observables.\nIn an earlier work, W.-T. Chiang and F. Tabakin deduced completeness-rules according to which 8 carefully selected observables are sufficient in order to determine the 4 amplitudes up to one overall phase. However, these rules are again only valid for idealized data. One point which is troubling about the complete experiments according to Chiang and Tabakin is that they enforce the measurement of the double-polarization observables with recoil polarization (BR and TR), a task which is very hard to accomplish experimentally.\nThe goal of this thesis was therefore to study the analogous problem, however not for extraction of the full spin amplitudes, but for the photoproduction partial waves ('multipoles') in a truncated partial wave analysis (TPWA) up to some maximal angular momentum cutoff lmax. The extraction of partial waves in such analyses proceeds on each energy-bin individually, thus one refers to them as single-energy (SE) fits. The work has been triggered initially by a paper from the author V. F. Grushin, which investigates similar questions for quite low truncation orders (lmax = 1). Here, a promising aspect of Grushin's work was that he has been able to infer (almost) unique multipole-solutions without using any double-polarization observables at all.\nThe early concept for the thesis consisted of approaching the complete experiment problem for the TPWA from two sides. Those consist of the purely mathematical, or algebraic, side, which should then be complemented by numerical investigations on TPWAs. The present document collects the results of the project.\nA review and further development of an earlier work by A. S. Omelaenko, which discussed linear factor decompositions of the polynomial amplitude, partial wave zero's (akin to so-called Barrelet zero's) and discrete ambiguities in TPWAs, is shown. This approach allowed for an identification of candidates for complete sets in a TPWA, although it was not fully clear up to which lmax such candidates hold up.\nA welcome by-product of the formalization for the photoproduction TPWA performed in this work was the possibility of doing so-called moment-analyses on the angular distributions of the observables alone. A survey of such analyses for observables in \u03c00-photoproduction is presented.\nLastly, the completeness-rules postulated in the algebraic part of the thesis had to be checked using model-independent numerical methods for the extraction of multipoles. Complete sets in TPWAs are thus studied numerically for synthetic idealized model-data, pseudo-data with errors of variable size and then, finally, also for real data. The influence of errors on the precision of extracted multipoles, as well as on the stability of the fits in general, is studied using the bootstrap.",

    "text": "Philly has great trails around the city, but the areas where the trails and car infrastructure meet, cross, or mix are often problematic. We provide some infrastructure for bikes, but that infrastructure disappears completely when we come to intersections.\nI recently read Kidicalmass organizer and Philly Pedals author Dena Driscoll\u2019s blog post, Last Half Mile Home. Dena lives in a big bikey area. She lives between the Schuylkill River Trail, the trails of the Wissahickon Valley, and nearby Manayunk Towpath, all sections that draw many cyclists. This same area is also has a regional rail station and bus transfer station. Heavy traffic also comes to the area from I-76, City Line Avenue, and Kelly Drive. Rail commuters, heavy buses, pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers come together in a congested space where cars move fast, hills are steep, sidewalks are narrow, and there is no designated bike lane.\nImage via Google Maps Traffic conditions: drivers are moving fast. Also note, the dark green line indicating the trail looks like it has a separate bridge crossing. In reality it is a narrow sidewalk along a bridge. Ah, Google Maps, you are a prankster!\nOne of the few signs for cyclists. Dena had to drag a cargo bike through the snow to cross to the other side to reach Ridge Avenue this winter. Photo credit: Dena Driscoll.\nI talked to Dena about what she has experienced and observed and then I took a ride up there to get a feel for the intersection. She said (and I would agree), The confusion is high! On the first nice days it gets confusing. I have had run-ins with other bikers biking wrong way in the street trying to figure out how to get to the towpath.\nI asked Dena how she learned how to navigate the trail end. She said, I learned how to do it by watching other bikers and going with what feels safe. I know from stroller usage that the westbound sidewalk is too narrow for that, let alone bike. I know cars will run the light and I need to wait longer to cross. It\u2019s even worse with the bad weather. They don\u2019t clear the trail at the end. No curb cuts are cleared. The empty buildings don\u2019t shovel walks. It\u2019s batty.\nI don\u2019t know if the area can be made better for bikes. There is not much room to create a specific place for bikes in the road. The trail has to be completed and linked to avoid this whole mess. Plans have been in the works, for some time, to link the trail and bypass this intersection, but there is no wayfinding or temporary measures to help cyclists safely navigate this area until the trail is linked.\nBike riders use this area not because they want to but because they have to. The trail is like a highway for bikes; it is the least hilly and easiest access between suburban Philadelphia and Center City. There are some trails on the west side of the river, but they are not as direct and have more hills. Besides the trails being an access point between the city and surrounding community they are great for recreational cycling and link to fun locations and historic sites, like Valley Forge.\nFor people like Dena who live near the trail and use it to get in and out of the city, linking the trails might lengthen her route but provide a safer and less congested place to access the street network. For those who want to enjoy the trails there needs to be a safe way to get to them.",

    "text": "Before we start, this is just a note that this is a guide designed for the absolute beginners in trading. How beginner, you ask? Well, we have sat down with an experienced trader to ask the all important questions about trading to teach us, absolute novices, all about the world of trading.\nWhere does the beginner start? How much do you have to learn? Well, the answer is, PLENTY. In fact, the learnings never end. Not only do you have to keep yourself constantly researching, but you have to be on top of new strategies and possibilities all the time.\nSo, keeping this in mind, we asked the trader the basic questions that you would have to know to get into the game and how to actually make a profit out of this tricky world.\nWhy would you go into trading if you have never done it before?\nPeople go into trading for various reasons. You need to make up your mind what the exact reasons are for you wanting to enter the trading space so that you don\u2019t put yourself in a bad position.\nDecide what your reasons are for going into trading in the first place. Are you looking to make some extra money to pay for your children\u2019s education, a dream trip or to put away for retirement? Or is this the start of your new, exciting career? Being a local trader and a once a week trader are totally different animals.\nBased on your answer, you can start determining what your timeline is in trading.\nAbsolutely! There are hundreds of trading platforms out there for you to choose from, but you do need to do some careful research into it as it is quite cut-throat. There are a lot that simply assume that you will lose and take your trades.\nWhat is great is that a lot of the platforms can be accessed through desktop and mobile, and many allow you to build your own personalized trading hub.\nIf someone was launching themselves into trading for the first time ever, what would your ultimate piece of advice be?\nIf you are first starting out, the first thing you need to get sorted is a risk management strategy. You can have the greatest indicators and the best strategy on how to trade, but if your targets and what profits you are taking and stop loss orders are wrong, you can still not make money.\nSo, basically you have to look at trades and see how they have performed in the past and what their historical movement looks like. If you are capable of doing a statistical study on it, do a stat study on what you need your stop level to be and how much loss you can take. You ultimately need to, going into the trade, know what your profit level needs to be and stick to that as rigorously as possible.\nWhen you execute a trade and buy something, the market could possibly go against you. This is when you start losing money, which is absolutely normal when trading. The market goes through peaks and dips and you need to know just how much you can take.\nAt some point you have to know when to exist the trade for a loss and the loss level cannot be higher than what your take take profits are. You have to have a lot higher success rate than losing, which falls within your strategic planning.\nThis is where it comes to you getting your trading strategy right and then sticking to it. Once a trader gets a trading strategy that works, most stick to them as long as they making a profit.\nIf you are looking to take ten ticks on the trade then stick to taking ten ticks instead of having a ten tick stop loss or something along those lines. A tick is essentially the change in trading price from trade. The minimum tick size for stocks trading above $1 is 1 cent.\nSetting targets depends on the reason why you are doing the trade. If there is a technical reason for it, you have to make sure that you set your timescale and stick to it. What is a reasonable level to make profit from it to is a question you have to be asking yourself too. Setting this limit is important as obviously everyone wants to make hundreds and hundreds of ticks, but it is not always reasonable all the time.\nMarket conditions are also one of the biggest determinants of when to stay and when to exit a trade. If there are huge events globally, you will need to be taking it into account. So, for example, if there big events like nonfarm payrolls out of the US, there are usually large moves on the markets. So, if you have a trade at that time, you will need to have a larger take profit because you are risking more because of the increased volatility of the market.\nTalking about market conditions, how important is it to keep up to date with what is happening globally?\nWake up and read the news. Go to bed reading the news.\nMost of the life of a trader is doing research and keeping the research in front of you while trading in order to make good choices and decisions. Everyone is trying to stay as well informed as possible to not get caught out by buying something that happens on the global scale.\nThere are tons of accurate and up to date news wires that you can subscribe to. But they are usually quite expensive. Market Squawks have all of the major screens like Bloomberg and Reuters which is always updated. They put out daily calendars and research papers to keep you updated with global events and market movements. Twitter is also great for breaking news for you to keep an eye on, although you need to keep watching the feeds and trends to make sure that it is accurate.\nThis also depends on what type of time period you are looking at trading over. Locals in the trade arena, which are the regular traders who trade several times a day need to have an in-depth knowledge. Other strategies mean that you only trade a few times a week, and this will mean that you don\u2019t need to be quite as in depth in market movements.\nIn saying this, it is important to have a proper risk strategy in place as you can land yourself in trouble. Hence why having the risk strategy was the first and foremost most important thing to have before launching your trading career.\nIn ending, the greatest advice given, is not to follow the pack. Don\u2019t do exactly what everyone else does all the time. Take time to work on your strategy and refine it over time. Take all of the main considerations into mind. Time frames, profit margins, your ultimate risk appetite. Don\u2019t get down when something does not work out and when you see a fall in the market. Keep at it. But also be savvy enough to know when to cut your losses.\n\u2190 Stock vs. Forex Trading \u2013 what to choose?",

    "text": "Vienna the capital of Austria was our first stop on the Epic trip to Central Europe. Vienna City has some of the magnificent palaces, churches and plenty of museums. While this post covers the top places to visit in 48 hours you definitely need a couple of days more if you are going to visit each and every major Vienna points of interest.\nThe S7 train on S Bahn which covers the route from the airport to the city center is a cheaper option but time-consuming for the more stops it makes. There are trains every 30 minutes. The other option pricey but the fastest way to travel to the city center is CAT (City Airport Train). The CATs also run every 30 minutes. There are also regional buses connecting Vienna Airport with the main bus stations of the Vienna City.\nWe had booked the hotel \u201cNovum Hotel Congress Wien am Hauptbahnhof\u201d which is right across the street from the Vienna main railway station which made the commutating from airport to hotel and to the city center much easier and convenient. The room though small had a spacious bathroom equipped with basic toiletries and 24 hours hot water. The hotel also has 24 services at the reception.\nCheck Availability and the Latest Prices on Booking.com for Novum Hotel Congress.\nThe major Vienna attractions are spread across the city and cannot be covered on foot. That said the city has a very good public transport system which cmakes exploring every part of the city very convenient and easy. We wish we were aware of this before visiting Vienna. In a haste, we booked hop on Hop off bus tour which wasn\u2019t a good idea. The city center attractions (around the Hofburg Palace) had to be explored on foot as the bus does not go everywhere. We needed transport only a couple times for which the public transport could have sufficed very well. And then the time constraint, the hop on hop off buses ended by 5.30 when we had to end our sightseeing and even couldn\u2019t take the bus to return to our hotel.\nTip: If you had enjoyed riding the old trams in Lisbon then you should not miss a ride on the old trams of the Vienna City equipped with wooden seats and old ticket machines for one of its kind of experience.\nThe Belvedere Palace complex built as a summer residence for Prince Eugene of Savoy comprises of two Baroque buildings the Upper and Lower Belvedere set in a Baroque landscape garden.\nThe Upper Belvedere houses the permanent display of Austrian art masterpieces from the Middle Ages to the present including work of international artists such as Claude Monet of Giverny, Vincent van Gogh, and Max Beckmann. The Lower Belvedere and the former Orangery is a venue for temporary exhibitions. You can book your tickets online here.\nKarlskirche is baroque church located near the prominent town square \u2018Karlsplatz\u2019. The church is dedicated to the 16th-century counter-reformer St Charles Borromeo. The church has an impressive baroque edifice topped by a copper cupola with the most interesting feature being the two columns modeled after the Trajan Column of Roman Forum in Rome.\nA spiral relief on the life of St. Charles Borromeo adorn the columns. The interior is decorated with rich frescoes and paintings inside the dome and the side chapels. The church is also a popular venue for regular concerts. There is an entrance fee to access the church. You can check the entrance fee and open times here.\nThe Naschmarkt is a bustling 16th-century market in Vienna just 5 minutes walk from Karlskirche. The market popular with locals as well as tourists sell everything from fresh vegetables and fruits to spices, herbs, cheese, bread, meat, and clothes from over 100 stands. The market also has numerous small restaurants serving traditional Viennese food. Every Saturday a flea market takes place alongside the usual market. We, unfortunately, missed this wonderful market for we visited on Austrian National Day which falls on 26th October every year when most of the places including the Naschmarkt is closed. The market is also closed on Sundays.\nWe walked through the Karlplatz Station to the other side which opened up to the Vienna Opera.\nThe Ring Road is a boulevard circling the historic Vienna Old Town and stands on the location of the former medieval city walls. Several prominent buildings featuring different architectural styles of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque stand along this road including the Vienna State Opera, Vienna City Hall, Burgtheater, and Parliament building. One can wander along the road or choose to ride the Ringstrasse tram that covers this route.\nThe Renaissance style Vienna State Opera opened in 1869 is one of the first buildings to stand on the Vienna Ringstrasse and one of the busiest opera houses in the world with 350 performances of operas and ballets every season. The Vienna State Opera is also open to children with regular children performances organized in a special theatre on the roof. The visitors can take a guided tour of the building offered in German, English, and Spanish languages and walk through the history and facts of the Opera building.\nTip: When you are here you may want to taste the famous Vienna Sachertorte at the Hotel Sacher which is 5 mins walk from Opera and is said to serve the original delicacy.\nWalking further from here towards the old town the streets are lined with cafes and restaurants with most of them having outdoor seatings. You can take a break and try some delicious patisseries and desserts.\nWe came across this beautiful Baroque fountain in the old town called Donnerbrunnen located in the Neuer Markt Square.\nProvidentia, the allegory of foresight or good government stands in the middle of the fountain surrounded by four allegorical figures representing rivers while the base is decorated with four putti with water-spewing fish.\nThe St Stephens Church dominating the Stephansplatz is an imposing church featuring Romanesque and Gothic architectural styles. The facade is flanked by two towers which can be reached via 343 steps for a wonderful view of the city. The striking feature of the church is its roof decorated with colorful glazed tiles which depict the double-headed eagle symbolic of the Habsburg dynasty and the coat of arms of the city of Vienna.\nThe church interior is home to resting place of several important people like Prince Eugene of Savoy, Emperor Friedrich III in a glorious sarcophagus and Habsburg Duke Rudolph IV. One can also tour the catacombs in the basement of the cathedral which is said to hold the remains of 11000 people. The church is also one of the top concert venues in Vienna.\nThe Baroque Roman Catholic parish church of Peterskirche or the St. Peter\u2019s Church looks like its squeezed between the surrounding buildings. The Peterskirche is the oldest church building dating back to early middle ages.\nThe church has a large copper dome flanked by two bell towers and is said to be inspired by the St. Peter\u2019s Basilica of the Vatican City. The church with austere looking exterior has a rich interior with beautifully sculpted pews, frescoes, and the Baroque pulpit.\nThe church shares its Neoclassical style facade with the surrounding building is not noticed immediately if not for its towering spire dominating the skyline. The Romanesque Church of St. Michael\u2019s is one of the oldest churches and is dedicated to the Archangel Michael. The church is located in Michaelerplatz opposite the Hofburg Palace.\nThe interior is decorated with rich 15th-century frescoes and one of the major Baroque work the impressive stucco work with alabaster Rococo sculpture \u2018Fall of the Angels\u2019. The large crypt located underneath the church holds 4000 corpses including mummified corpses in a well-preserved state in coffins decorated with fineries, flowers, and paintings.\nIn between the church and the gate of the Hofburg Palace is a small excavation site where archeologists uncovered the remains of a Roman settlement which can be viewed from glass covering.\nCafe Demel located close to the Hofburg Palace is a popular pastry shop established in 1786. Before you start touring the imperial palace of Hofburg you can take a break and spend some time relishing some delicious pastries and cakes.\nAs we had visited on the Austrian National Day the Heldenplatz, the square opposite the Hofburg Palace was jam packed with locals, tourists and the soldiers with several activities going on. It was even difficult to walk through the crowd. We decided to have a look here later and first visit the Hofburg Palace museum which was luckily open.\nThe Hofburg Palace built in the 13th century is the former imperial palace of the Habsburg dynasty rulers and today serves as the seat of the President of Austria. The Hofburg Palace houses several outstanding museums which offer insight into the history and culture of the Habsburgs.\nExplore the mysterious life of Empress Elisabeth through her personal possessions at display in Sisi Museum, the Imperial Apartments walks you through the lavish way of life of the Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth and the Silver Collection has a huge collection of silverware, centerpieces including valuable porcelain and crystal glasses offering insight into the dining culture of the Habsburgs.\nThe Sisi Museum, Imperial Apartments, and Imperial Silver Collection can be visited with a single ticket which includes an audio guide. Opening times for Sisi Museum, the Imperial Apartments and the Silver Collection.\nAlso must visit are the Spanish Riding School, the tour offers its visitors with a unique experience of watching the Lipizzan horses performing their daily exercises every morning in the beautiful Baroque riding hall and the Imperial Treasury displays an awe-inspiring collection of crown jewels and precious stones in the \u2018Secular Collection\u2019 and religious treasures in the \u2018Ecclesiastical Collection\u2019.\nYou can end your Day 1 with a classical concert at the Vienna State Opera.\nNote that covering both Belvedere Palace and Hofburg Palace on a single day with this itinerary may not be possible, in that case, you may need to choose one of them. We were very much intrigued by the life of Sisi and hence Hofburg Palace had to be on our list of places to visit in Vienna.\nCafe Central is a traditional Viennese cafe opened in 1876 serving Viennese specialties, traditional coffee, and patisseries in a grandiose interior. Start your day with a hot cup of coffee or some scrumptious cakes in Cafe Central.\nThe Burgtheater is the Austrian National Theatre and one of the most important German language theatres in the world. The guided tour of the Burgtheatre lets you experience the splendor of the grand staircases, grandiose interior decorated with rich ceiling paintings, fine sculptures of notable poets and the portraits of famous ensemble members in the \u2018Gallery of Honor\u2019.\nGuided tours of the interior that last for about 50 minutes takes place at 3 pm every day. The tours are offered in German and English languages daily in July and August. From September to June the tours are offered in German and English only from Friday, Saturday, Sunday and holidays. From Monday-Thursday tours are in German with summary in English.\nVienna City Hall is a Neo-Gothic style building completed in 1883 and serves as the seat of local government and office of the mayor. The richly decorated facade reminds us of the magnificent town hall of Brussels. The building was designed by Friedrich von Schmidt, who has also been the architecture of Vaduz Cathedral in Liechtenstein. The Vienna City Hall is a popular venue for numerous events are held throughout the year including Advent Market selling traditional handicrafts and the skating rink from January to March. Guided tours of the City Hall are available on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 1.00 pm.\nThe Votivkirche is a Gothic cathedral located on the Ringstra\u00dfe some 10 minutes walk from the City Hall. The magnificent church with three gabled portals and two spires flanking the facade dominates the Vienna City skyline.\nThe Austrian Parliament Building located on the Ringstra\u00dfe boulevard is the seat of the two houses of the Austrian Parliament. Guided tours of the Austrian Parliament are offered in both English and German language.The grandiose Greek Revival style building is decorated with numerous statues of Greek Gods, paintings, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian pillars, and Pompei-style stucco is designed in the style of ancient Greece. The main entrance at the portico at the least is modeled after the gate of the Erechtheion on the Acropolis of Athens.\nOne of the famous features of the parliament building is the imposing Pallas Athena Fountain located in front of the parliament main entrance. The fountain is decorated with allegorical representations of the four most important rivers Danube, Inn, Elbe, and Vltava of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the foot of Athena and little cupids riding dolphins.\nThe Museumsquartier is located across the street from the Heldenplatz and comprises of numerous important museums housed in Baroque as well as Modern buildings.\nApart from museums the Museumsquartier also has several restaurants and cafes which makes it a great meeting place. Museumsquartier also hosts several events and festivals.\nThe Hundertwasserhaus is an apartment house in Vienna designed by prominent painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser and draws visitors for its colorfully decorated facade and unusual architecture. Though one cannot visit the inside of Hundertwasser Haus you can definitely visit the Hundertwasser Village close by which has numerous bars and shops and designed on the same lines of Hundertwasserhaus. You can also visit KunstHausWien Museum which has a permanent exhibition for the works of Friedensreich Hundertwasser.\nThe Schonbrunn Palace was the summer residence of the Habsburg as the Hofsburg was the winter residence. The Baroque palace has 1441 rooms most of which can be explored on two different tours. Experience the splendor of Habsburg on the Imperial Tour that walks you through the 22 rooms where you can visit the apartments of Emperor Franz Joseph and his wife Elisabeth and other Rococo staterooms in less than an hour. The Grand tour is an extension of the Imperial tours which walks through 40 rooms which along with the apartments of Emperor Franz Joseph and his wife Elisabeth and other Rococo staterooms also includes a visit to the Feketin Room, Gobelin Salon which houses some exquisite Brussels tapestries, and the Vieux-Laque Room. You can prices and tickets here.\nThe Schonbrunn Palace garden is opened to the public since 1779 and is a UNESCO list of World Heritage Site along with the Schonbrunn Palace. The garden is decorated with several fountains, monuments, and statues with the most beautiful feature being the Great Parterre which comprises of 32 sculptures representing deities and virtues. The park is open from 6.30 am in the morning. Though the garden is free to access, the garden attractions like Zoo, the Palm House, Desert House, Orangery Garden all have a separate entrance fee.\nThe Prater is a large public park in Vienna which offers over 250 attractions for kids as well as adults. The popular Vienna landmark the Giant Ferris Wheel is also located in Prater. A ride on the Giant Ferris offers a breathtaking vista of the Danube and the Vienna City. Other attractions include Madame Tussauds, Prater Museum, the Planetarium, adventure activities like indoor skydiving, bungee jumping and much more.\nNext to the amusement park is the \u201cGreen Prater\u201d \u2013 an extensive green space with lush trees which makes for a pleasant place for walkers, joggers, and bicyclists. The miniature train Liliputbahn covering more than three miles is a great way to explore this beautiful neighborhood.\nThe church dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi is known by several names like St. Francis of Assisi Church or the Emperor\u2019s Jubilee Church or the Mexico Church and is located in Leopoldstadt close to the Danube. The church with an imposing fairytale architecture is a Basilica-style Catholic church completed in 1910 on occasion of 50th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I.\nThe most beautiful part of the church is the Elisabethkapelle (Elizabeth Chapel) in Art Nouveau-style which has its interior decorated with gold mosaics and marble.\nOriginally built as the part of flood protection system for the city of Vienna the 21 kilometers long Danube island is a popular recreational area for leisurely and sports activities with beach, Water Playground and several restaurants, cafes and clubs.\nNote: We recommend you head to the Schonbrunn Palace after lunch and later to Prater in the evening. So the tour of Burgtheater, City Hall, and the parliament or the museums in Museum Quarter may not be practical to fit in the first half of the day. So you will have to decide and plan which one of these you would want to include in the itinerary and fits best in the first half of the day.\nThe Sisi Ticket offers a packaged entry to the three imperial Vienna attractions \u2013 Vienna Hofburg (includes Imperial Apartments, Sisi Museum, and the Imperial Silver Collection), The Grand Tour of Schonbrunn Palace (includes fast-track admission to Schonbrunn Palace) and the Imperial Furniture Collection of Hofmobiliendepot.

What is your favorite Vienna point of interest? Is there something we missed and should be on top of the list of places to visit in Vienna?\nI am lucky to have a friend in Vienna so I have traveled there many times. I love the city best in winter, when it\u2019s all dressed up with the Christmas markets, and in summer, when it\u2019s a pleasure to walk around as the temperature is quite high. I actually love Demel, I have had some really good Sacher Torte there. The Museum\u2019s Quarter is such a nice place to relax and observe the locals.\nI have spent a considerable part of my life around Vienna, but for one reason or another haven\u2019t had a chance to visit it. Vienna has long been a destination of choice for many and it\u2019s charm, although European, has a certain uniqueness to it. Thanks for such a detailed itinerary and highlighting all the special spots of the city. Some day soon i hope to use it all.\nGood to know that it is not easy to explore Vienna completely by foot. I am definitely one who loves to just walk around and get lost in a new city. But I am glad to know that Vienna has a great public transportation system so it\u2019s easy to get around. The Naschmarkt totally sounds like me! I absolutely love markets and love seeing all the local products and produce available.\nVienna just seem like a delight to visit. I\u2019ve never been but have wanted to visit for years. Like many European cities \u2013 such a shame they are so far away from me in New Zealand! I want to see all those beautiful churches and cathedrals, especially St Stephens Church. I absolutely love the architecture! The Naschmarkt sounds amazing too.",

I find that REN never disappoint with their skincare and this also rings true for the V-Cense Revitalising Night Cream. Firstly, I\u2019ve got to state that REN is one of my favourite natural skincare brands and if you\u2019re a regular reader of The Beauty Boardroom then you\u2019ll already know that I refuse to use skincare products containing any nasties; all REN products are free from parabens, sulphates, mineral oil, petrolatum, synthetic fragrances & colours, TEA, DEA, glycols, silicones and PEGS.\nNow that we\u2019ve established that the ingredients list is absolutely top notch, what makes this the perfect night cream? It pretty much does everything that you\u2019d want your night cream to do. It contains Vitamin C & Citroflavonoids that boost collagen formation and protect from free radicals, Phytosterols from Camellia and Wheat Germ that boost lipid content as well as Frankincense and Boswellic Acid that smooth wrinkles and fine lines. So all in all, it revitalises, hydrates, evens out the skin tone, combats the signs of premature ageing and keeps the skin looking plump. The only other ingredient I would\u2019ve liked to see to make this product beyond perfect is hyaluronic acid since it\u2019s my star ingredient for hydration. However, this isn\u2019t too much of an issue as I combine this night cream with a hyaluronic acid serum like Hydraluron from Indeed Labs and that right there is just perfection.\nThe scent is gorgeous, mainly of frankincense, and the texture is rather thick. This would be fantastic for the colder months, which in London is almost every month! I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a nourishing night cream that just gets the job done. It\u2019s available on REN\u2019s website here.\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Butyospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Myristyl Myristate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Triheptanoin, Oryzanol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Boswellia Carterii Oil, Carbomer, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Boswellia Serrata Extract, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Beta Carotene, Linalool, Ascorbyl Palmitate.",

    "text": "Many studies have investigated the influence of breastfeeding on child health. It is well known that breastfeeding confers short-term benefits for child health by reducing mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases. A WHO report suggests a lower long-term morbidity from gastrointestinal and allergic diseases in infants who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months in comparison to non-breastfed children. Based on these data, UNICEF and WHO current recommendations are \"every infant should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, with continued breastfeeding for up to two years or longer\". While the evidence base for the protective effects of breast feeding on early infectious illnesses is strong this is not the case for many non-communicable diseases, where several systematic reviews have reached very different conclusions.\nHuman breast milk (BM) is the main source of nutrition for a newborn, and an important factor facilitating newborn adaption to the extra-uterine environment. The major constituents of the milk are proteins, fatty acids, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. It also provides bioactive factors influencing the infant\u2019s immune maturation, physical and cognitive development and moderation of the gut microbiota. Infants\u2019 immune ontogeny is influenced by maternal immunity via the placenta and breast milk. It is clear that nutritional influences are critical to both short and long-term health outcomes in the developing child, particularly during the first year of life.\nBy understanding BM composition and its determinants, we can identify new therapeutic or environment modifiable targets to influence metabolic and immune programming in early life in order to improve short and long-term health.\nToday, there is no clear understanding of the pathways linking the intervention, its effect on BM composition and health outcomes.\nThis issue is aimed at clarifying this with the goal of proposing better strategies to improve health.",

    "text": "For more than a decade, Daveyton's Mayor, Tom Boya, was Pretoria's evidence of the legitimacy of the municipal councils running its segregated black townships.\nAs president of the United Municipalities of South Africa, an organization of black municipal officials, Mr. Boya put aside his mayoral duties and traveled as far afield as the United States and Brazil to discourse on the concerns of local government.\nBut he recently stunned a crowd of 80,000 residents of Daveyton by announcing that he was quitting his posts. He said the system with which he had become identified had no future. Whether motivated by conscience or survival, his unexpected resignation elicited wild cheers and seemed to signal the beginning of the end for black township governments.\nMr. Boya, who is 39 years old, said the handwriting appeared on the wall after the African National Congress was made legal and Nelson Mandela released in February. \"I realized there was no room any more for a person to serve in a structure created by the Government,\" he said.\nHis decision to quit, he said, was prompted by his inability to stop the state-owned power company from switching off Daveyton's electricity for four days recently because of unpaid bills. He said it illustrated the frustrations he had faced in Daveyton since joining its town council in 1978.\n\"The weakness of the black local authorities was simply lack of funds, lack of local sources of revenue,\" Mr. Boya said. But, he quickly added, \"the structures were illegitimate\" because the white minority Government had imposed them on blacks.\nTheir resources are not shared with the satellite black townships, which began as stark dormitories for blacks working at menial jobs in white areas and which suffer chronic poverty and unemployment.\nAnti-apartheid civic associations have organized boycotts of rent and utility payments to protest inferior living conditions, which deprive municipal governments of the modest revenue upon which they depend. The associations have accused municipal officials like Mr. Boya of being puppets of apartheid.\nSatisfied that the crisis had been resolved, Mr. Boya flew to Rio de Janeiro for a conference. In his absence, the deal collapsed when the Transvaal Provincial Administration insisted that most of the money paid go to pay municipal wages and only a little to the utility company. He returned home to find the electricity turned off and his constituents irate.\n\"I felt so lonely,\" Mr. Boya said. \"I felt rejected. I felt betrayed.\"\nThe electricity was turned back on after residents took the utility company to court.\nMr. Boya's foreboding about the future of black local government was heightened when he went to a United Municipalities conference recently and found only 8 of its 60 municipal councils represented.\nMr. Boya said he went to the other rally and decided to quit. \"You could have heard a pin when I went over to the podium,\" he said. \"I then offered my resignation.\"\nJames Ngubo, chairman of the Daveyton Interim Committee said that \"Mr. Boya coming out really symbolizes that the system is bankrupt.\" He said the white minority Government had set up Mr. Boya as a \"good black man\" to make black local authorities palatable. His group had pressed Mr. Boya to resign, Mr. Ngubo said, and the power cuts \"must have been the last straw for him.\"\nFour other Daveyton councillors have followed Mr. Boya's example.\nMr. Boya predicted the inevitable collapse of all township government structures. \"I think it will be very healthy when it happens,\" he said. \"From those ruins, we can build.\"\nHe said municipalites must encompass white and black communities together and pool their revenue. And municipalities, he said, should be defined by region instead of race.\n\"The Government should abolish black local authorities and white local authorities and call for an election of local authorities under one umbrella,\" he said.",

    "text": "JERUSALEM: Israel could respond to any Iranian attack on it from Syria by toppling Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government, an Israeli security cabinet minister said on Monday, hinting that Assad himself may be targeted for assassination.\nIsrael and Iran have traded blows over Syria since February, stirring concern that major escalation could be looming ahead of next week\u2019s review decision by US President Donald Trump on the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran.\nSharpening these warnings, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Monday that Assad may find himself in Israel\u2019s sights.\n\u201cIf Assad allows Iran to turn Syria into a military vanguard against us, to attack us from Syrian territory, he should know that would be the end of him, the end of his regime,\u201d Steinitz told the Ynet news site.\nThere was no immediate response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office or from Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry.\nA Ynet text story had quoted Steinitz as saying explicitly that Israel would kill Assad, but this was not borne out by a video clip of the interview.\nOn Sunday, Israeli media carried what they described as an alert by Israel\u2019s intelligence services that Iran was planning a missile salvo against Israeli military bases from within Syria.\nSome analysts interpreted the publication as a warning to Iran that its plans were known, lest it try to carry out the missile strike without explicitly claiming responsibility.\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss Syria, where Moscow wants to see Assad\u2019s rule restored.\n\u201cWhoever is interested in Assad\u2019s survival should do the honor of telling Assad to prevent attacks on Israel,\u201d Steinitz said, alluding to Putin.",

    "text": "Today: Mostly sunny, with a high near 91. South wind 5 to 10 mph.\nTonight: Mostly clear, with a low around 69. East southeast wind around 5 mph becoming south after midnight.\nTuesday: Mostly sunny, with a high near 89. Light south southwest wind becoming southwest 5 to 10 mph in the morning.\nTuesday Night: A 20 percent chance of showers. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 63. Northwest wind 5 to 10 mph.\nWednesday: Mostly sunny, with a high near 72. North northwest wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 15 mph.\nWednesday Night: Mostly clear, with a low around 53.\nThursday Night: Mostly clear, with a low around 52.\nFriday: A slight chance of showers before 1pm. Mostly sunny, with a high near 66.\nSunday: Sunny, with a high near 68.\nAnother hot one by not only late September criteria but also mid- summer standards is in store today. If 90 is reached at Chicago it would be the first time with six 90 degree days in a row since July 2012 and the first time in September since 1978.\nThe longstanding upper ridge continues across the eastern half of the country today. There is a weak short wave circulation and associated 700mb cool pocket (+5C) seen on water vapor imagery over southern Illinois this morning. This feature will drift north today in the highly amplified pattern, and patches of high/mid cloud with it as well as some more cumulus will be seen. Forcing from this wave provides an outside chance of a couple showers this afternoon mainly in northwest to north central Illinois. This is where the cap is forecast to be neared or just barely overcome -- and that is factoring boundary layer mixing of lower dew points. None of the CAM solutions are overly excited but have simulated reflectivity \"blips\" in that area.\nTemperatures early this morning are running about 1-3 degrees cooler than previous mornings thanks to lower dew points and 850-925mb temperatures down about 1C in 24 hours. Taking this into account, have high temperatures forecast around 90 which would be near or right at record. The slightly lower dew points of lower 60s keep forecast heat index readings just a degree or two above the temperature. A lake breeze again will develop by noon and advance inland in lake adjacent counties in a similar way to yesterday. Expecting downtown to peak in 80s.\nA couple small chances for rain -- which has been a rarely used word locally this month -- present themselves on Tuesday and then again late in the week. All in all though, dryness should prevail much of if not all of this week. While some locations especially east could be up to the 90 mark Tuesday, a noticeable change in temperatures will occur during this period. The first drop back to around normal is by Wednesday and the one to 5-10 degrees below normal on Friday.\nThe surface cold front over the Plains this morning will make very gradual progress into the area Tuesday evening. Overall forcing along this boundary is not impressive, especially for much or any thunder given marginal lapse rates. The speed of this boundary may be even slower than what guidance is indicating given the strength of the inherent ridge as well as the parent surface low being fairly weak in pressure (1012mb at 00Z Wed). The slightly better probability of some showers Tuesday afternoon and evening is west of I-55.\nNorthwest winds behind the front on Tuesday night into Wednesday will bring a seasonable air mass into the area, with highs in the 70s for Wednesday and Thursday. Both of those midweek days look to be mainly sunny.\nAs the upper ridge collapses, a modestly strong upper trough drops southeast into the Great Lakes on Friday. The associated cold front looks to be strengthening as it moves through, meaning breezy conditions on Friday, possibly with some showers along the front. Lake effect clouds look likely though do not see a strong enough signal for lake effect showers at this time. Highs look to dip to the mid to upper 60s for a good part of the CWA Friday and Saturday with a slight rebound into early next week.\nSimilar aviation weather to the past several days is in store today. There will be some clouds -- few to scattered cumulus and some mid and high cloud -- but all VFR. A lake breeze will develop again and likely not arrive to ORD/MDW/GYY until after 21Z. Confidence in a lake breeze arriving at the airports is medium, and confidence is also medium in the forecast specific hour of arrival.\nA similar wind pattern will be seen over the lake today as in recent days, with an onshore lake breeze developing in the Illinois nearshore and to a lesser extent the Indiana nearshore. A cold front will move across the lake on Tuesday night turning winds northwest. Small craft criteria waves on Wednesday look probable for part of and maybe the entire northwest Indiana shore. A second stronger cold front, more typical of early autumn, will move southward across the lake late Thursday night into early Friday. This has potential for some gales over the open water depending on the low strength and exact track as it dives southeast over Ontario and Great Lakes region.",

We believe in high-quality, environmentally friendly, socially conscious products, services and technology repair solutions. We believe in helping people understand their technology and overcome technophobias; to inform, educate and assist others with all aspects of their technology.\nFrom our inception, TEKEASE has provided an alternative to the prevailing big-box computer stores and unqualified independents. We have all observed the rise and fall of these big-box brands due to low-quality, low-service and low-cost methods of operation.\nTEKEASE promotes a high-quality, high-service ethic. Our technical training and approach to resolving technology problems with consistency is unsurpassed.\nShould You Affiliate with Us or Buy A Computer Repair Franchise?\nThere is power and safety in numbers! While franchising has proven to be an excellent expansion model for some types of businesses, it simply doesn\u2019t work well in technology. Implementing technology well, or producing expected results for clients isn\u2019t as simple as making a burger.\nTEKEASE is not a franchise computer repair business and it never will be. We carefully considered the franchise business model, but discovered franchise computer repair operations don\u2019t scale well. Most importantly, we determined franchising was simply inconsistent with our primary mission.\nFranchisees are often led down the primrose path to endless debt, frustration and often disappointment. The community of TEKEASE affiliates constitutes an association of highly qualified technology practitioners dedicated to delivering consistent and predictable technology solutions under the TEKEASE name. Affiliates work in a collaborative working environment. Affiliates rely on and lean on each other, not corporate. The fact is, most people go into business on their own to become the boss\u2026not to have a new one.\nToday, our affiliates see ourselves as part of a multi-front industry war. The war has many opponents: the low-quality big-box stores, the manufacturers which pander to big-box brands, and that millions of independents who operate with no standards, no insurance, no training.\nTEKEASE has revolutionized the idea of delivering high-quality, high-service technology solutions without the high cost of purchasing a franchise or association with some buying group which provides nothing more than a list of vendors.\nTEKEASE affiliation is an internet-based, grassroots movement started by TEKEASE (\u201ctechies\u201d) who want to own their own local TEKEASE operation to support their client\u2019s and communities. It is a call to those techies who want to make technology easy for consumers and small business owners alike.\nGetting started is easy, write us an essay (application), license a name, set up a website, send us photos of your operation and you will become part of a new community of TEKEASE affiliates.\nAffiliation with TEKEASE is easy.\nComplete the Request for Affiliate Information form below.\nOnce accepted you will receive official notification and your TEKEASE Affiliate Badge.\nThere are currently three TEKEASE Affiliate Levels. Affiliation levels are based upon the method of business operation the Affiliate engages in.\nTEKEASE Affiliates are independent business owners and licensees of the TEKEASE brand name. The annual fee to Affiliate with TEKEASE ranges from $3000 to $15,000 per Affiliate location.\nAccess to TEKEASE Training and Certification Programs.\nAffiliate Network to Support Marketing Efforts.\nAbility to grow your professional network with other affiliates to share knowledge.\nA successful TEKEASE affiliate is operated by someone who loves technology and thrilling people.

We provide the TEKEASE training programs to give the affiliate knowledge of TEKEASE methods.\nThe TEKEASE affiliate program is designed for experienced technology professionals. Unlike a computer repair franchise system, we are not a no experience required program. Only affiliates committed to being involved in the program on a day to day basis will be considered.

    "text": "Every homeowner considers renovating their bathroom at some point. With a bathroom remodel, you can easily overspend and easily overdo it. You need to set a realistic budget before you start. Here, we will provide bathroom renovation tips covering upgrades that are expensive and unnecessary.\nSo, you invest in a fancy whirlpool but use it only ever so often. It sounds like a great idea to relieve stress and aches and pains. Yet whirlpool bathtubs are expensive, not to mention noisy and prone to developing mold. They can harbor bacteria and other pathogens as well. Therefore, a whirlpool is not a wise financial investment and should not be your main focus when considering bathroom tub and shower replacement.\nAside from bathroom tub replacement, another area where people overspend is flooring. Marble equals luxury, and luxury equals high costs. However, marble tends to be slippery and cold to walk on. It is porous and, thus, susceptible to staining. Accidentally spill a beauty product, and you can ruin your floor. Along with its costs, marble is also difficult to maintain.\nHeated flooring is one of those new bathroom trends that might not yield the return you expected. Sure, it can be convenient on a chilly morning\u2014but think about the need to rip up your existing floor, re-route plumbing, and deal with noisy, messy, and expensive construction. The extra heat can increase the demand on your cooling system. On the other hand, soft bath mats and bath sheets cost much less.\nNow you\u2019re drawing excess water without adding much value. Your hot water heater can supply only so much hot water at a time, so you end up reducing water pressure and running out of warm water. A standard tub enclosure or a shower surround is enough to meet your basic needs without straining your hot water system and wallet.\nA top-of-the-line set of towels may not seem that expensive, but chain stores sell reasonably priced towels. You probably can\u2019t tell the difference anyway. Then again, you can soften up your existing towels with a half-cup of vinegar, meaning you don\u2019t have to spend at all.\nA basic small bathroom remodel doesn\u2019t have to cost more than $1,500 to $5,000.2 The more you go for luxury, the more you\u2019ll spend. At American Bath Enterprises, you can upgrade/remodel and spend less. We offer quality shower surrounds, enclosures, components, and accessories at reasonable prices. If considering a bathroom replacement or update, view our products online; for help, call 888-228-4925 or feel free to contact us on the web.",

    "text": "With great sadness, the family of Tobe Hooper, famed movie director of both the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist (classics in the horror genre) announced his passing today at the age of 74.\nHooper, who worked both as a producer and director (and even occasionally as a writer) was best known for creating the legendary Texas Chainsaw massacre, a movie that would inspire a great number of horror films since then.\nThe lead character Leatherface proved such a hit with horror fans that he is receiving his very own prequel, which will be out later this year.\nHooper was a native from Austin, Texas where he was born in 1943. Eggshells was the name of his unsuccessful low budget hippie movie which meant his debut as a director.\nHis big break came in 1974 when Hooper assembled a group of teachers and students (he had previously worked as a university professor) to perform in another low-budget movie which was heavily influenced by the stories surrounding legendary serial killer Ed Gein.\nA group of friends would be picked off one by one in the most horrific of ways. The film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was a revolution for the genre and hence saw banishment in the UK and several other countries due to its extremely violent content, which only helped it\u2019s rise to fame.\nThanks to the success of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hooper was allowed larger budgets by the movie studios.\nIn 1982, Hooper received a script from none other than Steven Spielberg, who would also act as producer, named Poltergeist.\nThe story of a family coping with a haunted house also became an instant classic and made it into the top ten of 1982 of highest grossing films, quite rare for a horror movie at that time. Poltergeist was remade in 2015, to a much lesser successful acclaim.\nHooper continued to work in Hollywood but could never match the success of his early work anymore.",

    "text": "IAF Sixth Annual School Supply Fund Drive-Science!\nHave you got four minutes? That is all the time you will need to read this missive and understand our goals for this year\u2019s school supply fund drive.\nFor the past five years, the IAF has conducted an annual school supply fund drive, focused on Des Moines\u2019 neediest children. Last year\u2019s drive garnered a record level of support with $2356, but one experience served as a catalyst for change in how we approach our goal this year.\nToward the latter weeks of our 2016 fund drive, an out of state anonymous donor offered an additional $500, with one caveat: the entire amount must be spent on \u201cscience\u201d. Judging from prior fund drives, this was a generous donation, so we explored the needs of several DMPS schools, with an eye on the neediest schools and \u201cscience.\u201d We ultimately purchased and donated two quality, classroom-adaptable microscopes: specifically, the \u201cOMAX 40X-2500X Lab Binocular Compound LED Microscopes, with Double-layer Mechanical Stage and Digital Camera.\u201d Both scopes are still used on an almost every-day basis by the science teachers at Hiatt Middle School here in Des Moines. And one of the things we noticed when delivering the scopes was need; the equipment our donation replaced was outdated, to say the least. We also took note of the reception we received; the teachers were surprisingly grateful and appreciative. From that point, we decided to focus our efforts on closing the gap between DMPS science departments, with sadly deficient budgets, and schools outside the district who appear to be far more fortunate. After working with the science curriculum department at DMPS, an effort that included interviewing several science teachers, we were able to identify several areas of need that seem to fit within our fund budget.\nTELESCOPES: Nothing is more \u201cscience\u201d than a telescope that enables students to search the heavens for what is really up there. The Orion Astroview 90mm EQ Refractor Telescope is surprisingly affordable \u2013 about $279.00 plus shipping. The director of the DMPS science curriculum department explained that \u201cwe offer astronomy courses at several of our high schools that would benefit from direct space observations.\u201d About three hundred bucks would help open the minds and opportunities of close to 100 kids in one east-side middle school alone.\nAnd should our drive be even more successful, another scope that would serve teachers and students even more is the Coronado Personal Solar Telescope (Hydrogen alpha) with 1A Bandwidth. This scope, costing about $700.00, enables solar viewing during daylight hours, expanding learning to many inner-city kids who lack the means to travel after-hours.\nMICROSCOPES: The committee\u2019s research into DMPS science needs revealed two things: first, the extent to which teachers are doing their best to teach with outdated equipment and miniscule budgets is astounding. Teachers really do reach into their own pockets for some of the basic tools for the classroom. And secondly, for quality science equipment to benefit kids, it should ideally benefit teachers also, and be classroom-adaptable. One such scope that would benefit many students is the Leica EZ4 W, an \u201ceducational stereo microscope with digital cameras\u201d that allows students to electronically connect their personal electronic devices to the scope. Utilized for biology, earth sciences, environmental science, and chemistry, the cost is about $505.00 plus shipping.\nSTREAM TABLE: Not being teachers, we were unfamiliar with this device, but it would appear to be particularly suited to Iowa. The \u201cScience First Deluxe Stream Table\u201d is a classroom tool for teaching earth sciences, including study of erosion, sediment deposition, behaviors of rivers and lakes, applications to agriculture, etc. One teacher told us \u201cmost teachers would change how they teach if they got one of these.\u201d The cost is $549.00. The potential for benefitting many, many DMPS students is enormous.\nSYNOPSIS: When considering this year\u2019s school fund drive, think \u201cscience.\u201d Please be as generous as you can afford to be. Help us teach DMPS kids what is really \u201cup there\u201d through a good telescope; help literally hundreds of young people learn about the true composition of matter with a quality microscope; give an entire science department a quality Stream Table, and teach a hundred kids about \u201cearth science.\u201d SCIENCE is part of what IAF is all about and the IAF will match donations up to $1000!\nP.S. The donation phase of the campaign will run from Sept 15- Oct 15. Presentation of the science equipment to the DMPS system will be on Carl Sagan Day, Nov 9, 2017.\n\u2190 IAF\u2019s Fifth Annual School Supply Drive!",

    "text": "WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal regulators voted Wednesday to require companies to reveal more information about how they pay their executives amid a public outcry over compensation.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-to-1 to expand the disclosure requirements for public companies.\nCompany policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis.\nThe SEC also changed a formula that critics say allowed companies to understate how much their senior executives are paid. At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings. Such awards often make up most of top executives' pay.\nThe new requirements include information on how a company's pay policies might encourage too much risk-taking.\nSeparately, the agency voted unanimously to require thousands of investment advisers who have custody of clients' money to submit to annual surprise exams by outside auditors.\nThe surprise audits would allow independent accountants to review the books and verify that the money is there. The snap audits would apply to about 1,600 investment advisers that don't use third-party custodians, out of roughly 11,000 advisers registered with the SEC.\nThis move is aimed at plugging gaps that allowed disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff to deceive investors.\nThe expanded executive pay disclosure rules will take effect next spring, when companies send annual proxy disclosures to shareholders.\nThe changes will help investors make better-informed voting decisions for the companies in which they hold stock, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said.\n\"By adopting these rules, we will improve the disclosure around risk, compensation and corporate governance, thereby increasing accountability and directly benefiting investors,\" Schapiro said before the vote.\nBut Commissioner Kathleen Casey said she opposed some of the new requirements, such as added information on qualifications of directors and candidates for the board, that she said could be \"unduly burdensome.\"\nAs a result, Casey said she was voting against the rule as a whole.\nIt was the first final rule adopted by the SEC this year under Schapiro's tenure. Numerous proposals have been made by the commissioners.\n\u2014Legal actions involving the company's executive officers, directors and nominees for the board.\n\u2014The role played by diversity as a factor in choosing candidates for the board.\n\u2014Potential conflicts of interest on the part of compensation consultants retained by the company.\nThe Obama administration imposed pay curbs on banks that received federal bailout money. Since then, eight of the largest such banks have either repaid or said they will repay their federal money, largely to escape caps on executive pay.\nThe Federal Reserve has set a February deadline for the 28 biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. \u2014 for submitting 2010 compensation plans. The Fed also will be encouraging, though not requiring, banks to revise this year's pay plans if they are out of step with principles the Fed has proposed to limit risk.\nAnger over lavish Wall Street pay has led some U.S. banks to take pre-emptive action. Goldman Sachs, for example, has said it won't give cash bonuses to 30 top executives. Instead, the bonuses will be paid in stock that can't be cashed in for five years.\nCompanies will have to disclose how pay is determined in departments involved in the riskiest activities \u2014 or departments that produce a big chunk of company profits.\nThe new requirements were proposed by the SEC and opened to public comment in July. They build on rules the agency adopted in 2006.\nUnder current rules, companies don't have to reveal the full value of stock options they give an executive. Instead, they must disclose in their annual proxy statements only the portion of an options award that vests that year.\nThe new rule will require companies to show in a summary table the estimated value of all stock-based awards on the day they are granted. The SEC's 2006 rules had relegated those totals to a separate table that investors often overlook or find hard to decipher.\nAn example is the case of a company that decides its CEO deserves $10 million worth of stock options, to vest in equal installments over four years. Under current rules, the company would have to include only $2.5 million \u2014 one-fourth of the total of the $10 million total \u2014 in the summary table.",

    "text": "So why do I think that I'm not?\nAbout a year ago, we had some new friends over for dinner. They were lovely, their (3) children were lovely, and we had a lovely time. As I was newly pregnant with Rowan, I was closely observing the wife's parenting-several-children-at-one-time-with-MAKEUP-ON-and-NO-YELLING skills.\nAt some point during the evening, as she and I were discussing our lives as mamas and all that it entails, she commented, \"I'm just really good at being a mom\".\nFor some reason, this statement struck me the wrong way. I couldn't really figure it out. I mean, she clearly WAS a good mom (after dinner, her 6 year old daughter recited a several stanza classical poem for us, while she calmly dealt with her younger sons' repeated breakdowns), and what's more, I really liked her. So I knew it wasn't irritation or jealousy (ok, maybe a bit of jealousy).\nI've reflected on this conversation a lot over the last year. It always surprises me how that one moment towered over the rest. For a long time, I wasn't able to shake the feeling it left me with.... nor figure out what feeling it really was - until I realized that what I actually heard her say was, \"it's really easy for me to be a good mom\".\nWhat was pushing my buttons the wrong way was the idea that she was a good mom because it was easy for her, and I must not be because it isn't easy for me. Let me clear it up further - IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME. And somehow, somewhere along the way, I got the two confused.\nNow, I realize that I've always had this filter - whenever I see a mom laughing and chasing her kids at a park, I assume that they're having a good time because it's just so easy for her to shut out the world and focus on spending time with her kids. A mom successfully juggling morning wake up/meal prep/school drop off must be doing a great job because it's a breeze for her and she's just going to take a nap later anyways. Parents who refuse to simply plunk their kids in front of the tv must never have anything else that they desperately need to be doing.\nAnd it's not that I don't do these things - but somehow, deep down, I've felt like I'm not good at them because they're not always easy for me.\nIt's actually ridiculous if you think about it - would you say that you're not good at your job because it's difficult for you? No, in fact - the harder your job is, the more likely you may be to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in your ability to stick with it and get the job done. Would you say that you're not good at exercising because it's really challenging? The opposite - the more resistance you face, the sweeter the reward. And we know this, intuitively.\nThere are a lot of great parenting articles finding their way around the internet right now. Some are about how to look on the bright side of parenting, and others are about facing the challenges. I find myself in the middle - and I have a feeling I'm not alone. Because life as a mom is indeed full of bright, shiny, funny, memorable, endearing, and precious moments. But it can also contain such harsh realities as death, prolonged illness, very little sleep, behavioral issues, life transitions, sibling rivalry, teething, bullying, and maybe above all - OUR HUMANITY. I'm all for a posture of gratitude and contentment. But I also have to be realistic, and honest - IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME.\nSo, why do I make it even harder for myself by believing that to truly be a good mom, that it should always be easy for me? What if I was able to hold the two together, in the beautiful tension that all good and truly meaningful things share?\nI'm going to be like my new friend. I'm going to believe that I am really good at being a mom. Not because it's easy for me, or because I always do the right thing. In fact, part of the reason I'm good at being a mom is BECAUSE it isn't easy for me.\nI'm not going to feel sorry for myself that it's not always easy. I'm going to \"find my size\" in the joy of choosing a life that requires me to grow and stretch and reach. And I'm going to dare to believe that I'm not alone (if I am, and it really is easy for the rest of you, please don't say anything. Ssshhhhhhh).\nAnother wonderful thing floating around online right now is this video: showing a series of moms who describe themselves quite negatively, only to then be blown away by footage of their own kids' descriptions of them. I wonder how many of these moms were viewing their daily struggles and actions through the filter of whether pouring all of their heart, body and soul into another person was easy for them or not. Maybe if we saw ourselves the way our children did, we would be asking very different things of ourselves. Maybe we could believe that we are good moms.\nSometimes I get impatient and have a hard time keeping my cool. And I'm a really good mom.\nI grit my teeth and usually punch or elbow my husband when the morning call comes too early. And I'm really good at being a mom.\nSometimes I feel empty and like I have nothing left to give. And I'm a great mom.\nI often don't know how to engage my son and wish I was more creative and imaginative with him. And I'm a really good mom.\nI really struggle not to get angry when things don't go smoothly during our morning routine. And I'm a good mom.\nSometimes I want to give up and go away and live another life. And I'm really good at being a mom.\nMy favorite sweet-nothing to whisper to Aiden at bedtime is, \"I'm so happy to be your mom\". I usually feel like saying it after a really hard day. It's when we both need to hear it the most.\nMaybe it would be nice to whisper instead, \"it's so easy to be your mom.\" But really, even as I say it, I feel it's emptiness, the way it falls flat. We all know the familiar refrain of \"love is a choice\". I think that loving a child, with all of the intention and forgiveness and learning that it takes, is best characterized by it's choosing. I choose to be a good mom, because I want to be one.\nIt's not easy for me, but I'm really good at being a mom.",

    "text": "The full story here. Wired Blog Network.\nNEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) \u2013 General Motors Corp (GM.N) has asked the U.S. government for roughly $10 billion in an unprecedented rescue package to support its acquisition of Chrysler LLC from Cerberus Capital Management (CBS.UL), sources familiar with the talks said.\nSince we\u2019ve been licensed to drive, we\u2019ve owned quite a few vehicles. Everything from 4\u00d72 pickups to chevy citations and full-size 4\u00d74 trucks. But here we are going to talk about the Jeep and Eagle vehicles we owned and what we think/thought of them.\n(blakntan) Car was a base model DL and quite the pooch. It also didn\u2019t brake well in traffic. Automatic seatbelt not friendly to those who imbibe the occasional beer (hit to the head).\n(blakbetty) Base model so not a lot of options. Great on gas mileage, sporty but not too much power to get into trouble. Not kid friendly.\n(blakntan) Wife got pregnant, needed a family car. This was our first attempt. We owned it for a few years, most commutes during this era were an unqualified disaster in my opinion.\n(blakbetty) Zippy, great gas mileage, good commuter but I hit my head getting in every time \u2026 Made for short people.\n(blakntan) Loved driving this Jeep. When you mashed the skinny pedal on this thing, it let you know. Worked outstanding as a family vehicle and was more than capable in the Iowa winters. It was only sold because the wife wanted a wrangler. It is now doing commute duty for my brother.\n(blakbetty)I loved this vehicle; I could haul stuff like a truck and still had room for passengers. Never left me stranded.\n(blakntan) We drove out to Ohio to pick this up as a project, and a project it is. The frame was a huge disappoint, to the point where we were forced to buy a junkyard Jeep (1953 CJ3B) for a donor frame. However, the drivetrain (134 GoDevil and the rest) is in great condition. This project was still in progress until recently, but is now beyond my capability and time. I am currently in the process of parting this out.\n(blakbetty) 24 hr road trip for a vehicle that didn\u2019t run\u2026.Hmmmm. Took on a little more of a project than I think we could handle, but enough to get the Jeep bug started.\n(blakntan) What can I say about my YJ other than I LOVE IT! Bought this recently from a mom N pops used car lot in completely stock, albeit in need of maintenance. Since purchase, I\u2019ve done quite a bit of work; 4\u2033 Lift, 3/4\u2033 booms, 1\u2033 body lift, tires, rims and more. It drives like a Jeep should and I\u2019d rather be driving it than a 2008 Mustang. It has the Sahara trim package though most of it is gone. It was built according to Canada\u2019s laws (built for use in Canada) but didn\u2019t come with cruise or air, just tilt. I\u2019ve removed the painted to match fender flares and steps. The steps have been replaced by custom, home built, boat sided rocker guards with massive under-tub coverage.\n(blakntan) After getting my YJ, of course my wife had to had a Wrangler of her own \u2026 only newer. It proved my theory that for every dime I spend, a quarter goes to her :) Drives ok for a mallcrawler, but given the chance, I\u2019ll take my YJ.\n(blakbetty) Always wanted one and now I\u2019ve got it. As with 99% of all wrangler owners, I want to make some changes but that\u2019s just to make it my own.\nFull size images can be viewed in the Gallery.\nWe are now officially a 3 Jeep family. So long $$$$, jk.\nWith springtime fast approaching, Ive started working on the Jeep again, as well as helping CJ get his garage in order for this season\u2019s car maintenance.\nLancaster, OH and back again to retrieve it.\n(produced 1950-53) than 1946 CJ2A parts.\naccess plates on the body.\ndestroyed, attached to it but no serials present on this one either.\nunderseat toolbox as well as evidence of dataplates on the dash.\nlack of records (which I was forced to do).\napplication for a possible restore target as well.\nin our posession is also welcome.\nA CJ2A.. or an M38? The world may never know.",

The orientation is really just metadata, it doesn't affect the photo file.\n(5) tested with Firefox 61.0.1: .mp3 and .mp4 can be played. .3gp, .flv and .mkv cannot be played.\nThe Nextcloud app store lists furthermore apps which promise online (dis)playing and editing of draw.io-files, mindmaps, a password manager and a ebook reader. I didn't test them though. I did't check neither if offline editing of the used data types would be possible. But it would be worth thinking about bringing those features to Hubzilla.\n[* ] Tiddlywiki (If syncing and offline editing of the native Hubzilla wiki would be impossible). But it looks like syncing is not a feature of Tiddlywiki until now: Saving after editing your html-file doesn't overwrite the file, but forces you to download a new html-file.\nRecently I've been on a 8 hours ride on a train in a country where I have no cellular carrier data plan, and the WiFi offered by the rail service which I expected to use was turned off on that train. Thus I wasn't able to work on my wiki which is stored in #Hubzilla. This is just one use-case for the need of having a syncable #offline copy of a file stored in Hubzilla. Others cases would be i.e. when working with my laptop somewhere in the nature where there's no carrier network (it's actually what I am longing for these days since it's so hot in the city). To avoid misunderstanding, I like to mention here that #syncronizing is not the same as importing/exporting.\nIn the second chart, I added the same information for #Nextcloud (non-exhaustive; just main data types for comparing reasons). In this discussion @Mike Macgirvin brings up the vision of turning \"all the extra features etc. into apps\" similar to Nextcloud. When getting closer to Nextcloud in terms of features, Hubzilla needs to become competitive in terms of features. Together with the nomadity and the superiority in privacy, this will make Hubzilla unbeatable.\nPlease comment below about if you agree or don't agree with my statement and my evaluation (if necessary case-wise).\nIs the synchronizing frequency depending on the server? If yes, Is it set by the hub administrator, or can it be set by the cannel user?\nMost part of the text is garbled. But we would like to know more!\nTiddlyWiki in Hubzilla would be fantastic.\ncsv and pdf file editing supported via add-ons.\nBookmarks are synced through the Floccus extension across any numbers of machines in the browser.\nOr, you can export your bookmarks into html and manually move that file between machines.\nI believe NC allows real time multi-user editing of files in the UI - that is, I think, what is likely being referred to.\nNC works with Collabora Online for the multi-user editing of \"office\" documents. I don't know if the built-in editing of plain text documents supports multi-user. It never occurred to me to wonder about that until now.\nThe documents for multi-user editing in Nextcloud are of the type \"Etherpad\" or \"Ethercalc\". I mentioned them in the initial post. But the main topic I would like to talk here about is not multi-user editing, but offline editing.\nEtherpad and Ethercalc are solutions which allow simulaneous multi-user editing, and each person sees also the edits done by the other persons in real-time. The edits can be highlighted differently for each person.\nAll other data types shared with a syncing mechanism face the so-called \"sync conflict\" when multiple users are editing the same data at the same time. In these situations, the system indicates the different versions as \"conflict versions\", and the editors have to agree on one of the versions and dismiss the other(s). Of course, the chance to enter a conflict situation is higher, the longer an editing person is offline, because the sync mechanism always compares the version which was existing before entering the offline mode with the version which exists when syncing.\nwhich add-ons of Nextcloud? Does the csv add-on support displaying csv data in a table?\nI will edit the initial post and add it with your informations.\nOr are you talking only in contexts of single user / single device repositories?\nYes, since I am not granting editing permission to other users for data that I know I'm editing them offline. The users might get a permission to see the data, and if they want them to be edited, they have to request the edit to me, and I will do it.\nIf I want to work on something in a collaboration team, I only use the document formats \"Etherpad\" or \"Ethercalc\".\nHere is a shared text file with edit permissions. Anonymous users can download it, or they may add it to their Nextcloud instance for making edits. Let's say you had to download and edit it... I could still give you an upload-only permissions to send me your revisions.\nOwnpad application can be installed to add Etherpad and Ethercal into Nextcloud. This gives us multi-user editing. Feel free to edit this example document.\nOnlyOffice adds both multi-user and anonymous user editing from the browser for any shared documents, spreadsheets and presentations! Very cool and full featured, but requires a couple gigs of ram.\nCollabora / LibreOffice is also available as a complete office suite, but I have not tested it. Also requires a couple gigs of ram.\nI am not granting editing permission to other users for data that I know I'm editing them offline.\nYou shared this text file with download permissions, not with edit permissions.\nThat's why I stated in the initial post that syncing and exporting/importing is not the same.\nThe shared text file is shared with edit permissions.\nIf you want to grant anonymous editing, you'll need to use Etherpad via the Ownpad app, or install the OnlyOffice / Collabora Online apps to your instance.\n@sunjam interesting. I could edit it, and my edit is shown when following your sharing link.\nBut then I entered on purpose the sync conflict situation, to see how Nextcloud deals with it. First I deconnected the remote repository (containing a copy of the file). Then I edited the file through the Web UI of Nextcloud. The UI shows the error message (in grey text) that the edit cannot be saved.\nThen I edit and save the remote document.\nAs soon as I reconnect the remote repository, it lists both files, the initial and the remotedly edited one (marked with the conflict extension in the file name).\nSo, again: When I am the only one editing the shared file, I can deal with this easily since I know if my remote repository is connected or not, and I edit the data only through one UI when not connected. But as soon as you give edit permission to others, you increase the risk of sync conflicts.\nOn Hubzilla, only CalDav events and CardDAV addresses can be edited on both the Web UI and remotely.\nThe result is always: The edit of the Hubzilla CalDav event and of the CardDAV address which was made on the server is kept while the other edit is dismissed automaticly.\nWhen I edited Hubzilla CalDav events and CardDAV addresses on two deconnected remote machines (laptop and phone), one of the version is dismissed (laptop), even if i reconnected the laptop one second earlier than the phone (maybe the phone can sync faster than the laptop).\n I renamed the fourth column from \"syncable to/from remote machine\" to \"(dis)playable on remote machine outside webbrowser\" because, actually, accessing data with other tools than the browser is what I sometimes like to do.\n I integrated @sunjam's Feedback about Nextcloud.\n I removed in the Hubzilla table the ability to edit in offline mode: photos, pdf, txt, videos, audios and csv (because the WebDAV access procedure doesn't store a copy of any file on your remote machine).\n I removed in the Nextcloud table the ability to edit in offline mode: Etherpad/Ethercalc (because the system doesn't store a copy of the file on your remote machine).\nNextcloud edits offline be allowing access to it\u2019s files and services from third party devices via rest api\u2019s. Example, desktop and mobile apps that store, sync, and merge local copies of whichever files and folders you choose from the web server. This includes all etherpad, ethercalc docs, tasks, calendars, contacts, txt, and everything else.",

The establishment of the railways later allowed people to commute into central London, and by the start of the 19th the area had lost its popularity among wealthy classes. During the 20th century, the area became a centre for gentrification, particularly suitable for mid-class people.\nLearn more curious facts about Clapham.",

    "text": "Home \u203a Travel Health \u203a Essential First Aid Tips For Your Gap Year.\nEssential First Aid Tips For Your Gap Year.\nKnowing just a few first aid essentials is an important skill when you are travelling the world, and will go a long way to helping you deal with the inevitable simple cuts, scrapes and situations that you will come across. Here is an emergency nurses advice on what to do when you need to administer first aid to yourself or anyone else on your gap year.\nNow as a professional nurse I can give you qualified information and advice but please make no mistake this is in absolutely no way a substitute for actual training. A little bit of knowledge can go a long way but if at any point you aren\u2019t sure of what to do, you need advice, or your injury is a little bit more than your basic first aid kit can handle, then get yourself to the nearest clinic, hospital or any medical professional as quickly as you can.\nSo what are the first aid fundamentals that you should know?\nMake sure your first aid kit is well stocked.\nThis is an absolute basic requirement and I always carry my first aid kit with me wherever I am. Knowing how to pack a good travel first aid kit is important, and that doesn\u2019t always mean getting the biggest fanciest one filled with the latest gear like rebreathers and tourniquets. The average traveller is not in any way medically trained, and no one is expecting them to be, so why carry a lot of extra stuff you won\u2019t know how to use? Stick to the absolute basics and you will use them.\nMost cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated with over the counter dressings from your first aid kit.\nStop the bleeding. This is always the first step. Just apply firm (but not too firm) pressure on the wound with a piece of sterile gauze if possible or any clean and dry absorbent material if not. If you have a cut to your extremities, arms or legs, then try and keep them raised if you can.\n*Pro Tip: Ladies, if it is a heavy wound and you need to stop the bleeding quickly while you get help, and there is nothing else available, then you can press feminine hygiene pads on the wound and use a bandage to keep them in place if necessary.\nClean the wound. Any wound should be cleaned thoroughly before you apply the dressing. Use clean drinking water and pour thoroughly over the wound itself. The aim is to clean the wound of any dirt or debris. If you can see any debris in the wound then try and get it out if you can with flowing water, if you can\u2019t then it may need to be cleaned by a professional. You can use an antiseptic wipe on the skin around the wound to clean up any blood, but do not go near the actual wound itself with it. Dry the wound with a clean gauze pad or by resting a towel on it and then apply the dressing.\nWhen you should get medical help.\nIf the wound is large (longer than 5 cm) and you cannot stop the bleeding.\nYou are bleeding from an artery.\nThere is loss of sensation near the wound or you cannot move the effected limb.\nIf the wound is large, spread out, jagged or otherwise has caused a lot of soft tissue damage.\nIf there is a possibility there is a foreign body still inside the wound, ie a piece of glass.\nIf the wound is to your head or face.\nIt is not enough that you have to clean and dress any given wound, but you also have to watch for infection too. In many ways this can be more problematic that the wound itself.\nYou will need to check on and change the plaster or dressing frequently, the frequency depends on the type of wound and the dressing itself but you will know when the dressing needs changing. When you do this it is important that you see if it is becoming infected.\nPersistent or increasing pain in the wound itself.\nSwelling and redness that gets increasingly worse (a little swelling and redness can be normal in any wound as part of the healing process).\nDiscoloured pus forming in or around the wound.\nA high temperature of 38 degrees (100F) or above.\nIf you see or notice any of these symptoms then you have gone beyond simple first aid and need to seek advice and possibly get some antibiotics. (Do not just start taking antibiotics \u2018just in case\u2019).\nBurns aren\u2019t really a backpacker specific or common injury, but it doesn\u2019t really do any harm to know the basics.\nCool any burn with lukewarm running water for a minimum of 20 minutes, tap water is ideal because you need to keep the water flowing if possible.\nDo not use ice or iced water, these can be as bad on a burn as hot or scalding water.\nContrary to popular belief do not slap a load of greasy butter on a burn.\nIf you can, remove any clothing or jewellery from near the burnt area. If you can\u2019t, or material is stuck to the skin, you may need professional help.\nDo not place any cotton wool style dressing on a burn wound.\nKeep the wound clean (keep running lukewarm water over it).\nDo not burst any blisters (as this can lead to infection).\nMild burns or scalds that don\u2019t need any treatment (what we technically call superficial epidermal burns because they only affect the top layer of skin) usually heal in a week or so without any treatment or scarring.\nPainkillers such as Paracetamol or Ibuprofen are ideal to treat any pain.\nAlthough most minor burns can be treated on your own with the tips above, if however the burns are more serious you should not hesitate in seeking help. A bit of basic common sense can judge this really.\nIf the burn covers a large area (bigger than your hand), then get help.\nAny burns caused by chemicals or electricity should be professionally treated.\nBurns that immediately cause sever blisters or exposes any deep layers of skin or bone should be checked by a professional.\nIf the burn is circumferential, as in it goes completely around a limb or your torso, or if it is to the face, you should seek help.\nIf you can, cover the burn with cling film or a clean plastic bag until you can get medical help.\nSunburn is a much more common traveller injury, and should not be dismissed lightly. Most of the time sunburn is pretty mild and does not need a visit to a clinic, nurse or doctor, and whilst it may feel uncomfortable should heal up in a week. During this time there are things you can do to relieve the symptoms.\nCool the skin by sponging it with cool (not cold) water or having a cool shower.\nA cold compress with a towel dipped in cool water and placed over the affected area will help.\nAloe vera is your best friend when you have sun burn and can be applied directly or with a cold compress on top.\nStay well hydrated and drink plenty of fluids (water is good but this also includes juice as well). This will keep you cool and prevent dehydration.\nIbuprofen or paracetamol can be taken for any pain.\nIf the skin is very inflamed, then speak to a pharmacist who may give you some hydrocortisone cream.\nSever blistering or swelling that does not subside after a day or two.\nA high temperature (38C or 100F) or above.\nInsect bites and stings are a common problem for travellers all over the world. The absolute majority of the time they are nothing more than an annoyance and will get better in a few hours or a day or two at most.\nRemove any insect, stinger or tick that may be attached to your skin.\nMake sure the wound area is clean with soap and water to prevent infection.\nApply a cold compress or ice pack to reduce swelling, this can be repeated as much as is needed.\nDon\u2019t scratch the bite, as this may lead to infection.\nIf the wound is painful or uncomfortable then basic painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen should be enough.\nIf the wound is itchy then see a pharmacist about over the counter hydrocortisone or antihistamine.\nIf symptoms do not improve or get worse after a few days.\nIf the bite or sting is on or near your mouth, throat or eyes.\nIf the bite or sting swells to a large area, this may be an allergic reaction.\nIf the bite starts exuding pus or gets increasingly painful or swollen after over the counter medication.\nIf you start wheezing, have difficulty breathing, develop swelling in the face, mouth or throat, have difficulty swallowing or feel dizzy or faint, then this should be considered a medical emergency and you should get medical help immediately.\nIf you start developing flu like symptoms, swollen glands or a high temperature (38C or 100F) or above. This may be a sign that you have contracted an insect borne disease.\nThese conditions can be quite common in travellers on extended treks in tropical or desert regions, and if heat exhaustion is untreated it can lead to heatstroke or sunstroke which are considered medical emergencies. I have personally seen the symptoms start developing in other travellers several times on many treks over the years, and they can be so easy to dismiss until they become a problem.\nA headache (one of the first signs of dehydration).\nDark or offensive smelling urine.\nLethargy, tiredness or general weakness.\nA decrease in blood pressure (although you won\u2019t know this without medical treatment) and an increase in pulse rate (anything above the average normal rate of 60 \u2013 100 beats per minute) .\nGet them to lie down in a cool place such as a room with a fan, air con or in the shade.\nRemove any unnecessary clothing and loosen everything else. The aim is to expose as much skin as possible.\nCool their skin with whatever you can, cold compresses, a cold wet flannel, anything you can use to keep them cool and wet.\nFan them to cool them down if you don\u2019t have a fan available.\nKeep them hydrated and get them to drink as much as possible. Water is best but fruit juice and rehydration sports drinks are just as good.\nMost people should respond really well to this within 30 minutes. If they don\u2019t, or they are already developing the more severe symptoms of heatstroke, then you should get medical help immediately.\nWith the amount of adventure activities and partying on gap years and around the world adventures, strains and sprains are actually pretty common. These common injuries affect the muscles or the ligaments, especially around the knees, ankles, wrists and fingers and thumbs, and the majority don\u2019t actually require medical treatment but can be looked after on your own with a bit of know how.\nUse PRICE therapy which stands for protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation.\nFor the first 2 -3 days rest up and avoid using the affected joint or muscle as much as possible.\nCold compresses and ice will help to keep the swelling down. Don\u2019t apply ice directly but wrap it in a towel or something similar.\nAvoid the heat for a few days if you can, don\u2019t sit out in the sun.\nCompression bandages are good for keeping swelling down but don\u2019t wrap them so tightly that it restricts blood flow and remove them before sleeping.\nIt is a good idea to book yourself or upgrade to a private room in a hostel or a guesthouse for a few days if possible, especially if your mobility is limited with a knee or ankle injury, so you can rest, keep your injured limb elevated and minimise activity. Just catch up on a few Netflix shows or finish that book.\nBasic painkillers such as paracetamol should be sufficient for any minor sprain or strain. Non steroidal anti inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen aren\u2019t recommended in the first couple of days.\nAfter a few days of rest then try and move about as normal (this is all relative and you shouldn\u2019t push yourself too far either) or do some basic movement and rotation exercises to get the joint or muscle back to normal. Muscles can take a day or two longer than joints.\nThere is no hard and fast rule on how long it takes a sprain or strain to heal. For minor injuries you should be able to use the injured limb again \u2013 even if it is still a little tender \u2013 after a week or so of rest. You should be pretty much back to normal after a month or two, but it can take a lot longer too if the injury is more severe.\nMost sprains and strains can be treated without medical help and just take a bit of rest and rehab, but there are obviously exceptions to that. If you have any of the following symptoms or there is no improvement at all after a few days of self treatment then you should seek further medical help and advice.\nIf the pain is severe, lasts longer than a couple of days and is not helped with paracetamol.\nIf the joint or muscle cannot be moved at all.\nIf you can\u2019t put any weight or pressure at all on the joint or muscle or it gives way when you try to use it.\nIt looks disjointed or is an unusual shape.\nIf there is numbness, discolouration of the skin or coldness in any part of the joint or muscle.\nNow remember that as important as it is to have a good working knowledge of how to look after yourself and how to use a good, basic first aid kit to patch yourself up when needed, it is just as important to know when to get help too.\nIf something does happen and you need advice, don\u2019t hesitate to go and get it. If you can\u2019t get to a nearby clinic or hospital, then there is also my online travel clinic if you need it. I may not be able to physically patch you up myself but I can advise you on what to do and where to go next when you need it.\nAsk A Nurse. 10 Of Your Most Common Health Questions Answered.\nLove this post! I never thought about using a pad in case of emergency and it makes total sense! I also had to use superglue once to put over a cut on my leg, it was helpful.\nThank you so much, yeah it is essentially what the pads are designed for if you think about it. \ud83d\ude42 Careful with using superglue though, it\u2019s not ideal for all cuts. Thanks for commenting I really do appreciate it.\nGreat tips, thank you. Will definitely be keeping them in mind for future travels.\nIt definitely pays to be informed and prepared, thanks for this post.\nYou have to be a little careful there, superglue is different from the medical glue we use, and whilst it can protect a cut it can also seal a lot of bad stuff in allowing it to become infected if you aren\u2019t careful.\nThanks Emma, I hope you never need to use it but the information is here if you do!\nI love this, I think it really should be mandatory for all wanabe backpackers and travellers to read your blog and equip themselves with knowledge like this. Amazing.\nHaha thank you Alice, I wish it was my readership would boom!\nFantastic tips and a great, useful post for any backpacker.\nVery useful post. I think anyone going travelling around the world needs to learn basic things like these to look after themselves.\nAwesome, thanks for this. Its great to know some basics before you go anywhere.\nSo useful! I am definitely going to bookmark this.\nAn excellent article with a lot of very useful advice, good job.",

    "text": "The problem I am tackling is categorizing short texts into multiple classes. My current approach is to use tf-idf weighted term frequencies and learn a simple linear classifier (logistic regression). This works reasonably well (around 90% macro F-1 on test set, nearly 100% on training set). A big problem are unseen words/n-grams.\nI am trying to improve the classifier by adding other features, e.g. a fixed sized vector computed using distributional similarities (as computed by word2vec) or other categorical features of the examples. My idea was to just add the features to the sparse input features from the bag of words. However, this results in worse performance on the test and training set. The additional features by themselves give about 80% F-1 on the test set, so they aren't garbage. Scaling the features didn't help as well. My current thinking is that these kind of features don't mix well with the (sparse) bag of words features.\nSo the question is: assuming the additional features provide additional information, what is the best way to incorporate them? Could training separate classifiers and combining them in some kind of ensemble work (this would probably have the drawback that no interaction between the features of the different classifiers could be captured)? Are there other more complex models I should consider?\nPerform dimensionality reduction (such as LSA via TruncatedSVD) on your sparse data to make it dense and combine the features into a single dense matrix to train your model(s).\nAdd your few dense features to your sparse matrix using something like scipy's hstack into a single sparse matrix to train your model(s).\nCreate a model using only your sparse text data and then combine its predictions (probabilities if it's classification) as a dense feature with your other dense features to create a model (ie: ensembling via stacking). If you go this route remember to only use CV predictions as features to train your model otherwise you'll likely overfit quite badly (you can make a quite class to do this all within a single Pipeline if desired).\nAll three approaches are valid and have their own pros and cons. Personally, I find (1) to typically be the worst because it is, relatively speaking, extremely slow. I also find (3) to usually be the best, being both sufficiently fast and resulting in very good predictions. You can obviously do a combination of them as well if you're willing to do some more extensive ensembling.\nAs for the algorithms you use, they can essentially all fit within that framework. Logistic regression performs surprisingly well most of the time, but others may do better depending on the problem at hand and how well you tune them. I'm partial to GBMs myself, but the bottom line is that you can try as many algorithms as you would like and even doing simple weighted ensembles of their predictions will almost always lead to a better overall solution.\nLinear models simply add their features multiplied by corresponding weights. If, for example, you have 1000 sparse features only 3 or 4 of which are active in each instance (and the others are zeros) and 20 dense features that are all non-zeros, then it's pretty likely that dense features will make most of the impact while sparse features will add only a little value. You can check this by looking at feature weights for a few instances and how they influence resulting sum.\nOne way to fix it is to go away from additive model. Here's a couple of candidate models.\nSVM is based on separating hyperplanes. Though hyperplane is linear model itself, SVM doesn't sum up its parameters, but instead tries to split feature space in an optimal way. Given the number of features, I'd say that linear SVM should work fine while more complicated kernels may tend to overfit the data.\nDespite its name, Naive Bayes is pretty powerful statistical model that showed good results for text classification. It's also flexible enough to capture imbalance in frequency of sparse and dense features, so you should definitely give it a try.\nFinally, random forests may work as a good ensemble method in this case. Randomization will ensure that different kinds of features (sparse/dense) will be used as primary decision nodes in different trees. RF/decision trees are also good for inspecting features themselves, so it's worth to note their structure anyway.\nNote that all of these methods have their drawbacks that may turn them into a garbage in your case. Combing sparse and dense features isn't really well-studied task, so let us know what of these approaches works best for your case.\nNot the answer you're looking for? Browse other questions tagged machine-learning classification feature-selection logistic-regression information-retrieval or ask your own question.\nHow to approach Multilingual Text Classification?\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , Removing colinear features in cross validation set up is correct or not?\nHow to combine sparse text features with user smile for sentiment classification?\nIs it valid to include your validation data in your vocabulary for NLP?",

    "text": "As we gathered, the teacher instructed each of us to choose a partner. \u201cOne of you will be blindfolded and the other will be a guide,\u201d he added. Everything went black as I slipped on the blindfold and allowed my partner to nudge me forward and lead me by the hand. A once-familiar classroom was suddenly a maze of desks and chairs to bump into or trip over. No longer self-reliant, I was utterly dependent on my guide for directions and safety. But the worst was yet to come.\nLeaving the classroom, we staggered down the hall. My other senses, once ignored, began to provide clues as to where we were. Laughter and talking meant other students were nearby. We must be in the hall. Ouch! That must be a door. The hard surface under my feet indicated a sidewalk. Automobile sounds fading in and out, suggested we were near a road.\nA road? Wait a minute! We\u2019re on a road \u2014 with cars? Isn\u2019t that \u2014 dangerous?!\n\u201cYou are now stepping off the curb and onto the highway,\u201d said the teacher. Suddenly, my body lurched out of balance as the ground under my feet dropped eight inches. Imagine eight tiny inches with the power to disrupt everything that was secure in my life. Knowing exactly where I was never seemed to matter before but now details were crucial. How could I take the next step if I didn\u2019t know where that step would lead?\n\u201cStop and listen,\u201d commanded the teacher. I heard the familiar sound of an automobile engine only this time it was getting louder. Alarms in my brain screamed, \u201cYou idiot, run. A car is heading straight toward you!\u201d But the sound went safely by, only to be quickly followed by a similar sound from the opposite direction. Again, the voice inside me screamed, \u201cRun!\u201d But again, nothing happened. We removed the blindfolds, rubbed our eyes and found ourselves standing in the middle of a busy hightway with cars whizzing by.\nI never before grasped the fear and helplessness that accompanies blindness. This was a terrifying lesson for me.\nIs this what God means by spiritual blindness? At first, you think you can manage okay as other senses provide clues; but suddenly something shifts and you are thrown off balance. Alarms in your brain scream out as you sense approaching danger. Your spiritual eyesight now becomes crucial but you seem to be blindfolded. How can you take the next step in life if you cannot see where to place your feet?\nSpiritual blindness produce feelings of helplessness and fear. But Psalm One offers hope for the blind.\n\u201cOh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked \u2014 But they delight in doing everything the Lord wants. (Psalm 1:1) This is not a lighthearted promise of joy as in eating ice cream. This indescribable joy can only come from God. How do we obtain it? We begin to open our spiritual eyes and carefully watch where we place our feet. Don\u2019t search for shortcuts. Rather, begin to look seriously at the reality of our spiritual blindness and the benefits of relying on God\u2019s light.\nThere are two opposing principles within Psalm One. First is the promise: \u201cThey are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season without fail. Their leaves never wither, and in all they do, they prosper.\u201d (1:3) In other words, the storms still exist but God gives strength to withstand and continue bearing fruit?\nSecond is the warning: \u201cBut this is not true of the wicked. They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind. They will be condemned at the time of judgment.\u201d (1:4) Most of us would not quickly claim to be spiritual trees but none of us wants to be chaff either. So, what do we do? How can we improve our spiritual eyesight?\nAre you struggling with spiritual blindness? Has your equilibrium been knocked around? Are you sensing approaching danger?\nMaybe it\u2019s time for a new Light: Who knows exactly where you need to go and can be depended upon to light your way to safety. What are you waiting for? Open your eyes and pray for God\u2019s light to guide your journey.\nIt sure beats an oncoming car.",

I have received a RachhLoves Fall box in the past, and when I saw that this Spring box had become available, I decided I wanted one as well.\nWe received 5 items, and we actually had some choices!\nInfluenced by trends in L.A, these eyeshadows deliver pigmented, blendable colour in velvety, fierce finishes you'll obsess over.\nThese shadows are smooth and pigmented. I've attached a swatch below. This eyeshadow duo was sent to everyone in the same colour.\nVolumize and lengthen your lashes instantly with a single application. Take your lashes to a whole different dimension.\nI haven't tried this yet - but I will do a review once I do open it up and give it a go. The brush looks interesting! We were given the choice of the super sizer, clump crusher, full lash bloom, and lashblast fusion.\nThese colours are pretty! My only complaint is that I wish that the brown shade was matte, then you could put it in your crease and outer corner, and then the peachy shade on your lid, for a complete simple eye look.\nEssie nail polishes provide flawless coverage, chip resistance, and outstanding durability, and are always DBP, toluene, and formaldehyde-free.\nThere were a few other colours to choose from, which were all perfect for spring/summer... however I picked pink because it's a colour I would wear the most.\nA multitasking mask that instantly helps perfect the appearance of the skin in five targeted ways: nourish, calm, firm, plump, and refine in just 10 minutes.\nThis sounds somewhat promising, but we will see! I will do a separate review on this one too!\nGet the staying power of a stain, the intense colour of a liquid lipstick, and the high shine of a gloss in one long-wearing formula.\nI also chose a pink shade because those are what I tend to wear the most. It does stain the lips slightly, but just feels like a gloss on the lips. I wouldn't say that it has a very long wearing formula.\nThe nail polish in Backseat Besties was a little more bright than I was expecting. But this is two coats. I always like Essie's forumla, and this seems perfect for summer!\nJust a swatch of the shadows and lip crayon. The lip crayon was also a lot brighter than I was expecting.\nAnd here I am wearing the Smashbox Cover Shot (Golden Hour) eyeshadow duo, and the Burt's Bees Glossy Lip Crayon in Pink Lagoon. As you can see, the lip is very glossy!\nI'm glad I ordered this kit because it has the perfect colours for Spring/Summer! I will definitely get use out of all of these products.",

This past Monday the Toltias (as we lovingly have been named by Tif Fussell) spent the day in Seattle. Our first stop was a lovely lunch at Sitka and Spruce!\nI can't say enough wonderful things about Sitka and Spruce. The atmosphere and the service were amazing and the food... the food... WOW! Spectacular! And it just kept coming, one delicious course after another. We left there feeling cared for and our bellies full.\nAfter poking around the shops nearby we got back in the car and headed toward Fremont to visit the lovely Kathy Hattori of Botanical Colors. Kathy graciously welcomed us into her natural dye studio where she was busy at work color developing for a top secret project. Kathy not only teaches and sells her natural dye material but she also works with companies such as Eileen Fisher to develop natural dye colors.\nEven though Kathy was busy at work she shared some of her process with us and showed us some of the things she has been working on and she even welcomed us to dip some yarn into her indigo vats. Thank you so much Kathy! We look forward to having Kathy teach again this Summer in Carnation (details coming soon!).\nOur adventures in Seattle were not over. Kathy said we had to visit her friend Patricia's studio which was just down the street, and we are so glad we did!\nPatricia Belyea was a graphic designer who left the busy corporate world to follow her passion of quilting. She opened a shop, Okan Arts, in her home where she carries the largest selection of vintage yukata cotton in North America. Walking into her studio was a delight. So many gorgeous rolls of fabric neatly organized in shelves, beautiful quilts and Japanese trinkets on the wall. Patricia offered us tea and cookies as she told us a bit about what she does, how she got started and about her new book that will be coming out in October. We left Patricia's studio feeling inspired and ready to hop on a plane to Japan, a few of us even left with yards of fabric. If you're in the area be sure to contact Patricia for a visit, her shop is open by appointment only.\nThe best part of Tolt is the people; the people who come to visit us and the people that work here. I am so grateful to spend my days with my fellow Toltias and look forward to our next outing together!",

How does the characters move the story along?\nAll nine circles lit. A figure each stepped into one of the five spotlights. Marcus recognized most members of this Grey Council: Captain Sheridan, Michael Garibaldi, Susan Ivanova, Lennier, but not the hooded man.\nThe Ranger surmised the missing members would appear as necessary. He was curious about the absent associates. His interest peaked when two of the circles dimmed into a medium gray as opposed to the spherical bright lights and rectangular dense darkness that surround him.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come together to add our two cents in and get your decision.\u201d Sheridan turned to the Ranger.\n\u201cWill I die?\u201d Marcus laughed.\n\u201cNot like you haven\u2019t had them before.\u201d Ivanova raised an eyebrow.\nFor her attire, she wore her Earthforce Captain\u2019s uniform. Her brown hair with golden highlights was pulled back into a severe bun. Blue eyes remained stern.\n\u201cJust like the good ole days.\u201d Garbaldi chuckled.\n\u201cAnd what is your choice?\u201d Lorien motioned with his pale fingers.\n\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Ivanova paced in her circle.\n\u201cTo offer you a third choice.\u201d She smiled.\n\u201cBut none of the choices lead me to any destination that I would like to go.\u201d Marcus glanced to Susan.\nIn Marcus\u2019s peripheral vision, he saw Lorien and his swirling blue lights disappear. He noted the alien appeared older than he remembered. Lorien was indeed too tired to expend his energy on their petty squabble. He did not even say goodbye.\n\u201cLondo, this is not the time.\u201d Delenn went to meet him.\n\u201cOh, then when is it?\u201d Mollari dodged her and headed straight for the Ranger. He pulled Marcus out of the light. Once he exited the circle, Marcus was in a grand Centauri hall.\nA feast was set. A long table with fine chairs, dinnerware, and related items anchored the room. The centerpiece was a large chandelier high above them.\nServants placed food on their plates and drinks in their cups. The smell was fabulous. Marcus\u2019s appetite was awaken.\n\u201cI think I can take care of myself.\u201d The Ranger smiled, stood, and left the grand banquet hall.\nOnce in the corridors, Marcus followed the voices of Stephen and G\u2019Kar. No matter where he turned he could not catch up to his friends. He felt he was on a different plain of existence.\nMarcus followed his Minbari friend into a small room. Lennier shut the door behind them. He stood in front of the Ranger.\n\u201cSuch as?\u201d Marcus lifted an eyebrow.\nThe men turned to the new arrival. Each bowed to the other. The triumvirate was complete.\n\u201cWhy do you suggest him?\u201d Lennier stared at Sinclair.\nWith a snap of Sinclair\u2019s fingers, Marcus found himself in his corporate office. He sat at his desk. Not a luxurious room, but he enjoyed the exclusivity and quiet of the four walls.\nArisia III was as he recalled. The miserable volcanic planet spewed radioactive gases and soot. Even in the orbital far above the planet, the filters could not clean out every particle in the air handler system. Grime seemed to accumulate on his paperwork every hour of every day.\nHe brushed the sorrel specks aside. In the air, the soil smelled the same: musty and acidity and putrid. As the powder danced in the light, shimmers of metal and mineral floated. Twinkles of tiny individual fireworks brightened his day as they succumbed to artificial gravity.\nHe exhaled as he reminisced. The company had been his father\u2019s mining colony. A venture he inherited. One his younger brother did not support.\nMarcus held William accountable for his unreliability. He needed his younger brother\u2019s support. He could not run a successful colony by himself. He required help.\nWhen he looked up again, William sat in a guest chair on the other side of the desk. His bright smile illuminated Marcus\u2019s dreary countenance. How he has missed his kid brother.\n\u201cWhat do you have to be guilty for?\u201d Marcus leaned forward in his chair. His elbows sat on the desktop.\n\u201cDone.\u201d William reached over the desk and offered his palm.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Delenn\u2019s voice entered the room.\nCircles We Find Ourselves In the final installment, Part IV, will be coming next week at the same Undawnted time and same Undawnted station.\nHere's Part I and Part II, if you missed it.

    "text": "The existential threats to people and the environment from climate change are increasingly well understood. NOAA\u2019s 27th annual State of the Climate report revealed record-setting climate change indicators in 2016, resulting in extreme global events including late-season Hurricane Matthew, which devastated parts of Northeast Florida. In addition to more active hurricane seasons, climate change indicators \u2013 such as extreme heat, severe drought and vector-born disease such as Zika \u2013 carry systemic implications for Florida\u2019s marginalized communities. Hear from experts on why climate justice, community-based change initiatives and integrating climate resilience and equity into your grantmaking portfolio deserves philanthropic attention, as well as important ways philanthropy can support and amplify this work.\nShamar Bibbins serves as a program officer for Environment at The Kresge Foundation, where her grantmaking supports policies and programs that help communities build resilience in the face of climate change. Shamar plays a lead role in managing the Environment Program\u2019s Climate Resilience and Urban Opportunity Initiative. That initiative supports community-based nonprofit organizations seeking to influence local and regional climate resilience planning, policy development and implementation while reflecting the priorities and needs of low-income people. She also contributes to the development and implementation of program strategies. Shamar joined Kresge in 2014, bringing a history of engagement in environmental efforts and a commitment to action on climate change. She previously served as the director of national partnerships at Green For All, a national nonprofit dedicated to building a green economy strong enough to lift people out of poverty. Shamar earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in science, technology and society from Vassar College and received a Fulbright Fellowship to Fukushima University where she conducted research on environmental social movements in Japan.\nDr. Mike Bauer retired as the City of Naples, Florida Natural Resources Manager where he was responsible for all environmental matters within the City\u2019s jurisdiction. In that capacity, he coordinated with federal, state, and regional agencies, city council, and citizens\u2019 advisory groups. He established programs that included Naples Bay water quality testing, oyster reef restoration, seagrass protection, stormwater pond nutrient reduction, filter marsh construction, gopher tortoise restoration, fertilizer reduction, and artificial reef construction. Mike also created a City energy savings program and a Green Business program; he brought in over $1 million in grant monies for City environmental projects. Mike was a National recipient of the 2012 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Walter B. Jones Memorial Award for Excellence in Local Government. He was appointed by the Governor to the State of Florida Environmental Regulation Commission in 2011 He was the 2009 State Recipient of the Florida Local Environmental Resource Agencies Environmental Leadership Award.\nMike has a Ph.D. in Environmental Policy, a J.D., a M.S. in Wildlife Biology, and a B.S. in Biology. Before beginning work on his Ph.D., Mike was an environmental law attorney and policy analyst for the Yakama Indian Nation of Washington State. He had legal responsibilities with respect to tribal natural resources within their 1.2 million acre reservation and extending over an area of approximately 11 million acres within which the Tribe has reserved Treaty rights. Prior to earning a law degree, Mike was an assistant refuge manager with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. His responsibilities involved management, planning and evaluation of natural resources on a federal barrier island/estuary coastal complex.\nCaroline Lewis is on a mission to educate communities on the climate science, seriousness and solutions, and to motivate individuals to become climate-conscious voters.\nShe is the Founder and Executive Director of The CLEO Institute, which stands for Climate Leadership Engagement Opportunities. CLEO is the only 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in Miami, FL solely dedicated to climate change education, engagement, and advocacy. For two decades, Caroline was a science teacher and school principal, spending fourteen of those years at Ransom Everglades in Miami, Florida. She then became the Education Director for Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, creating the Fairchild Challenge, which is an environmental education program that annually engages tens of thousands of students in Miami and around the world. Caroline founded CLEO in 2010 because she recognized the need to address climate literacy by breaking down scientific data and educating communities at a grassroots level. By connecting the dots inherent in climate science, seriousness, and solutions, CLEO inspires an urgency to act.\nCurrently the Director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice, Jacqui Patterson, MSW, MPH, has worked with Peace Corps, IMA World Health, and ActionAid International, co-founded Women of Color United, and serves on the Boards of Directors for the US Climate Action Network, National Black Workers Center, Institute of the Black World, and Center for Story Based Strategy and the Steering Committees for Interfaith Moral Action on Climate Change and Center for Earth Ethics, as well as serving on the Leadership Circle for the Climate Justice Alliance.",

Kusatsu Onsen is also very close to Karuizawa where the popular outlet mall, Karuizawa Prince Shopping Plaza, is located. It is only within an hour and a half from Kusatsu Onsen to Karuizawa by bus, so you can enjoy both hot springs and shopping at the same time! Let's check it out!\nLeave Shibuya Highway Bus Terminal located on the 5th floor of Shibuya Markcity at 8:20 a.m.\nIt takes about 4 hours and a half to Kusatsu Onsen. You can go straight to your destination without carrying your luggage or transferring trains. Bus trip is a lot more comfortable and easier, compared to traveling with trains.\nThe bus arrives a Kusatsu Onsen Bus Terminal at 12:47 p.m. Let's leave my luggage in the coin locker and go sightseeing!\nThere are a lot of public hot springs where anyone can get into in Kusatsu Onsen. One of the public hot springs, Shirahata-no-yu, located within 3-minute walk from the bus terminal is open from 5:00 a.m. and it is for free.\nYou will see the landmark of Kusatsu Onsen, Yubatake, in front of Shirahata-no yu.\nYou can visually enjoy Yubatake by watching the steam of hot springs and by smelling the hot springs as well.\nThere is foot bath nearby.\nYumomi dance and Performance at Netsu-no-yu, located in front of Yubatake, is also one of the most recommended sightseeing spot in Kusatsu. You can experience \"Yumomi\" which is a method to bring the temperature of hot spring water down by stirring with wooden planks.\nYou will receive a certificate if you experience \"Yumomi\".\nIf you get hungry, there are lots of places to eat near Yubatake. There is a main street within a 3-minute walk from the center of Kusatsu Onsen. There are restaurants and souvenir shops along the main street.\nAfter lunch, let's walk down to Kosenji Temple which is also located near Yubatake. Let me tell you the best scenic spot here. Walk up the stairs for a while and if you turn around and look straight down, you can see the whole Yubatake field from there.\nI got a very cute good luck charm at the temple.\nIf you want to walk a little bit more, I would suggest walking down to the National Park called, Sainokawara park which is about a 10-minute walk from downtown.\nIf you keep waking through the path along the natural hot spring coming out of the ground, you will find a huge hot spring bath outside, called \"Saino Kawara Onsen\"\nYou can enjoy different faces throughout a year. Cherry blossoms in Spring, greenery trees in Summer, tree foliage in Autumn, and accumulating snow in Winter.\nLet's go to the hotel I am staying tonight.\nTonight's hotel is Onsen Ryokan \"Boun\".\nYou can choose your favorite Yukata from more than 100 kinds of designs. Let's find the one you like.\nGuest room and public bath are very nice and comfortable, so you can really relax here.\nIf you are not comfortable using the public bath, you can reserve a private bath. So, no worries.\nYou can have a dinner in a private dinning space. Dinner served here is so delicious!\nYou can stay here without meal if you rather eat outside the hotel.\nLet's go for a walk to Yubatake field after dinner. Yubatake field is lit in different colors at night. The illumination creates a totally different atmosphere and it is so fantastic and romantic.\nAfter breakfast, let's leave Kusatsu Onsen for Karuizawa.\nIt is only an hour and a half by local bus. The bus runs only once an hour, so you might want to check the timetable in advance. You do not need a reservation.\nThe bus fare is 2,200 yen one way.\nKaruizawa Prince Shopping Plaza is located within a 5-minute walk from Karuizawa bus terminal. There are more than 200 outlet shops and popular brand shops. The shopping plaza is huge and surrounded by nature, so it feels nice by just walking around inside the shopping plaza.\nIf you are done with shopping at the outlet, let's leave your luggage at Karuizawa station and rent a bicycle. Cycling to Harunire Terrace and enjoy their caf\u00e9 and shops is a popular model route of sightseeing Karuizawa.\nI found a nice guest house, Bell's Cabin Caf\u00e9 and Guest House, located at about 20 minutes from Harunire Terrace. If you have time to stay one more night, please check it out!\nIf you would like to go a little further, there is a scenic spot, \"Shiraito Falls(also called Shiraito-no-taki)\" located within a half an hour by bus from Karuizawa Station. You can enjoy nice fresh air and the smell of the beautiful nature.\nRending a bicycle and using a bus is the best way to get around Karuizawa and to save your money and time.\nLet's get back to Tokyo!\nFor the return trip from Karuizawa to Shibuya, there are highway buses running every one hour from 4:30 p.m. thorough 6:30 p.m. It takes only about 3 hours. Now, we are back in Tokyo!\nHope you enjoy a trip to Kusatsu Onsen and Karuizawa.",

    "text": "Updates on policy, programs, and perspectives from the MA food system.\nMore than 80 advocates, farmers, and SNAP recipients participated in HIP Lobby Day at the Massachusetts State House on March 1, meeting with legislators and staff to educate them about the Healthy Incentives Program and the need for ongoing funding to support it. The Program provides a dollar-for-dollar match for SNAP dollars spent on fruits and vegetables purchased at participating farmers markets, farm stands, mobile markets, and community supported agriculture (CSA) programs statewide. Every dollar allocated to this program is a direct investment in the health of Massachusetts residents and communities, our local economy, and our natural resources.\nOn October 1, 2014 the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) began enforcing the Commercial Food Waste Ban, an effort to divert food waste from landfills. MassDEP targeted food waste and other organics in part because it was the largest segment of the municipal solid waste stream. Food and other organics account for well over a million tons a year of the approximately 5.5 million tons of waste Massachusetts disposes of in landfills and incinerators every year.\nMassachusetts\u2019 Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) Program is one of the oldest state farmland protection programs in the country. Enacted in 1977, the program targets the most productive soils and purchases perpetual easements that assure the land will be available for farming for generations to come.\nThe Massachusetts Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) has far outpaced expectations, with SNAP recipients purchasing more than $2.5 million of fresh produce from local farmers between April and November, and earning an equal amount of incentives in the process. In the first seven months of HIP, 58,000 SNAP clients benefited from the program, exceeding redemption expectations by more than 470%. Nearly 50% of the 33,000 households that have benefited include a senior, and more than 30% include a child.\nThe MA Food System Collaborative hosted the 2017 Massachusetts Food System Forum in Leominster on November 17. More than 200 people, from farmers to funders, elected officials to nonprofit leaders, looked back at how the food system has become stronger in the two years since the completion of the Massachusetts Local Food Action Plan and generated ideas on how to work together to continue to move toward the goals of the Plan.\nAfter more than two years of planning and development, the Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) issued its first incentives in April, and has already far surpassed expected participation. In addition, the Massachusetts Legislature and governor, recognizing the importance of the program, made a significant investment in HIP in the State\u2019s FY\u201918 budget. This statewide program offers a one-for-one match to SNAP recipients when they use their EBT cards to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables directly from participating farms at farmstands, farmers markets, mobile markets, and CSAs.\nA new program is improving access to fresh, healthy foods for thousands of families around Massachusetts, and increasing sales for local farmers. The more than 440,000 families in Massachusetts who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are receiving mailings this month to inform them about the Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) (www.mass.gov/hip), which seeks to increase food security for SNAP households, support the local agricultural economy, and improve health outcomes for participating families.\nPollinators and their habitats are in danger, and their critical role in our food system requires careful consideration and deliberate action. Honeybees alone are responsible for one out of every three bites of food we eat. Without healthy pollinator populations, our food system would struggle to provide enough food, experience decreased diversity of local foods, and face significant economic and employment loss. In Massachusetts, pollinators contribute to major agricultural crops that, if threatened, would negatively impact our local economy. For instance, cranberries are the state\u2019s most valuable agricultural commodity, cultivated on about 13,500 acres and generating $1.43 billion in local economic activity, according to the Massachusetts Cranberry Revitalization Task Force. A threat to the health of pollinators jeopardizes this industry \u2013 the healthy food it produces, the income it earns, and the livelihoods of its 6,900 workers. And cranberries are not alone \u2013 the sustainability of much of the Commonwealth\u2019s fruit and vegetable crops rely upon the health of our pollinators.\nSenator Anne Gobi has introduced an amendment to the FY18 House budget that would provide necessary matching funds for operation of the Healthy Incentives Program (HIP). We need as many senators as possible to sign on to this amendment by 5:00 this Thursday, May 18.\nTo read the May 2017 issue of the Massachusetts Food System Collaborative&apos;s newsletter, click here.\nApril 4 is the annual Ag Day at the State House event, when advocacy and trade groups gather in Boston to educate legislators about policy priorities for farmers. The legislature is considering several dozen bills related to the food system this session, from land preservation issues to food waste, and the MA Food System Collaborative has compiled a white paper highlighting priority legislation and budget items. 28 food system organizations signed on to the white paper, representing thousands of farmers and other constituents.\nFood Banks originally started to supply food to people who were experiencing emergency situations, such as the loss of a home to fire or natural disaster, or perhaps an unexpected job loss. These were short-term needs that the world of charity could address. What we are seeing now, however, is an on-going need for food pantries and community meal programs. People seeking food assistance are from every walk of life \u2013 people with advanced degrees, military veterans, single parents, retired elders, working families, people living with disabilities and chronic medical conditions. For each person who needs to seek food assistance on a regular basis, it feels like one on-going emergency, but often a forgotten one in the public eye. We know that there is no shortage of food in our country, or in the world, but rather too many people cannot access food. For this reason, the Worcester County Food Bank (WCFB) believes that food is a fundamental right and that hunger is an issue of social justice.\nThe Massachusetts Food System Collaborative is hiring!\nMembers of the MA State Legislature have introduced more than 5,000 bills for the 2017-18 session, many of them related to the Commonwealth\u2019s food system. A number of these bills would take action toward the goals of the MA Local Food Action Plan.\nData from the first extensive survey of local food sales in the U.S. shows that Massachusetts farmers are national leaders in sales of food products directly to consumers.\nOn November 21, the Massachusetts Food Policy Council sent this letter to Governor Baker and legislative leaders, outlining the Council&apos;s priorities based on the 2015 Massachusetts Local Food Action Plan. These are issues that the Council hopes to amplify and address, through collaboration, research, and education.",

    "text": "Richard Owen Roberts, president and founder of International Awakening Ministries, is the keynote speaker for the annual \u201cAwaken\u201d prayer gathering, scheduled for March 8-9 at Pleasant Garden Baptist Church near Greensboro. The event is free, and a love offering will be received.\nA special pre-conference dialogue and dinner with Roberts on Friday, March 8 from 3-6 p.m. is open to pastors, ministry leaders and prayer leaders. The dialogue session and dinner are free, but registration is required. Learn more and register at ncbaptist.org/awaken.\nRoberts is one of the leading authorities on the subject of revival and spiritual awakening throughout the world. He has had a passion and burden for revival and spiritual awakening since he was a teenager and believes that the Lord wants to send revival to the church and spiritual awakening to the culture once again in America.\nThe Lord wants to send revival to the church and spiritual awakening to the culture once again in America.\nHow long have you had a deep burden to see revival and spiritual awakening?\nEver since I was a young man and called to preach. It\u2019s actually been over 70 years now, and the burden has never waned but increased. After I preached my first sermon at a home for the aged when I was 13-years-old, God, through the work and manifestation of His Spirit, began focusing my heart toward the need for revival among God\u2019s people.\nHas God used other people or writings to influence your ministry toward revival and spiritual awakening?\nYes, indeed He has. He used an obscure writing on revival by Albert Barnes called \u201cThe Theory and Disirableness of Revivals\u201dto really grab my heart about the great need for revival among God\u2019s people and how God uses revival as a catalyst for spiritual awakening and evangelism among those who are lost. I am sure that God also used the prayers of my grandparents \u2014 my father\u2019s parents \u2014 who were from Wales, which is called the \u201cLand of Revivals\u201d to impact my spiritual life and desire to see revival. Wales experienced some 50-60 significant revival movements from 1500-1910, including the 1904-05 Welsh Revival. I was actually named after a popular Welsh revivalist from the 1800s, Richard Owen.\nIs revival different from spiritual awakening?\nYes. Revival is for the church and is what takes place when the church is renewed and restored in its relationship with the Lord as He draws near through His manifest, holy presence. Spiritual awakening refers to what takes place in the surrounding world or lost culture. Both are something that only God can accomplish as He manifests His presence with and through His people and among the lost multitudes. As God\u2019s Word takes root in revival among His people a healthy awe and fear of God sweeps His people and subsequently the surrounding lost world as many are converted to Christ. People who had no interest in Christ days before suddenly become open to the preaching of God\u2019s Word and salvation. It is a truly wonderful thing.\nAre you hopeful that God will send revival and spiritual awakening to sweep the American church and nation?\nYes, I am. I am not saying that we are on the brink of revival, but God is definitely raising up individual believers who are waking up to the reality of God\u2019s judgment on the church and nation as a whole and the utter hopeless state we are in apart from a sovereign work of God through revival and spiritual awakening. These individuals believe in what God can do. They see it and are passionately praying, longing for and hanging on to God and His Word that He will suddenly draw near to His people in revival, which ultimately will result in a great spiritual awakening among those who are lost.\nWe are looking forward to you being with us in North Carolina for the \u201cAwaken\u201dprayer gathering March 8-9. What do you hope attendees will glean from our time together?\nThat the greatest need for believers today is to return to Christ in holiness. Holiness is the result of God\u2019s reviving work in their lives. Holiness also produces a life of righteous living and Christlikeness which results in an unwavering obedience to God and His Word and a holy fear and reverence of God. That\u2019s when the lost world takes notice of who God is and their need for Christ.\nJoin us Mar. 8-9 for this statewide prayer gathering.\nWould be there but it\u2019s the same weekend as the East Coast Mens Conference in Rocky Mount that I\u2019ve been attending for many years. I\u2019ll be praying for the event.",

    "text": "When Thanksgiving preparations are concerned, I favor recipes that can be cooked ahead. The only thing I make on Thanksgiving day is the turkey. This avoids the situation where I'm so exhausted from cooking by the time my guests arrive that I can't enjoy their company. So bit-by-bit, during the past several weeks, I've been cooking and refrigerating or freezing all the other items on my menu.\nBeing an avid iDevice user, and a huge fan of recipes found on epicurious.com, I decided to focus my efforts to go paper-less, if not totally paper-free, on this combination of software and hardware. The Epicurious app, available for both Apple and Android devices, is free and has many useful features, including the ability to set up your own recipe box and create shopping lists that come in handy during trips to the grocery store \u2013 for example when I am trying to remember how many apples go into the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup. If you're looking to expand your repertoire, the app also gives you access to the full library of Epicurious recipes.\nI sprung for the upgrade ($1.99) that would keep these treasures in a culinary cloud and enable me to sync my recipe box across platforms \u2013 my iPhone, iPad and desktop computer.\nThe question was how well the app would import the \u201ckeepers,\u201d which I have gleaned from a variety of sources.\nNot surprisingly, it worked best with recipes that originally came from Epicurious. The only keeper that actually falls into this category is a recipe I use for Thanksgiving leftovers \u2013 Moroccan Chicken Pot Pie, which for obvious reasons I make with turkey instead of chicken.\nImporting The New York Times recipe for Apple And Butternut Squash Soup was more cumbersome. It first required that I download the \u201cEpi Clipper,\u201d tool and drag it to the toolbar of my browser. This was easily enough accomplished on my desktop computer, though since the tool is powered by ZipList, I first had to enter a bunch of personal information and sign up for ZipList, which I would have preferred not to do. Nor, after a handful of attempts, was I able to install Epi Clipper on the browser of my iPad \u2013 this despite the fact that I am a reasonably tech-savvy person.\nThe next thing I discovered was that although it is now possible for me to access the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup recipe on my iDevices, what I get is just the recipe title and list of ingredients. For the full instructions I must click on a link that takes me to The New York Times website where the original recipe appeared. This is fine provided that you have Wi-Fi or a cellular data plan that works in your kitchen.\nAll this said, I did make the Apple and Butternut Squash Soup several weeks ago using the recipe on my iPad rather than on the very yellowed, water-stained original that I clipped from The New York Times in 1989 and have been referring to ever since. The soup can be made far an advance of Thanksgiving and frozen. When doing that, I don't add the half-and-half until I am ready to serve it.\nWith one exception, I have found this recipe is a crowd pleaser. My son eats it for breakfast, dunking toasted French bread in it. And I once delivered a quart of it to a neighbor after a sudden death in his family, and he told me it was great comfort food. But I will never forget the pain of watching a guest who obviously did not like this soup. He swirled it around in the bowl with his spoon, taking tiny mouthfuls, and washing them down with big gulps of water, until I swooped down and took the bowl right out from under his lifted spoon.\nAnother thing you need to know about this recipe is that although it is one of my keepers, it takes many hours to prepare. One guest who asked for the recipe later told me that she decided it was easier just to eat it at my house than to make it herself.\nIn my march (actually it was more of a crawl) towards a paper-less kitchen, I had less success with another New York Times recipe that is one of my Thanksgiving keepers: Cranberry-Pineapple Chutney, which by the way, can be made several weeks ahead and kept in a jar in your refrigerator. This recipe was part of a 1988 story, \u201cWhere Do Cranberries Come From, Anyway? The Answers.\u201d When I used Epi Clipper, the only ingredient that appeared was a pinch of salt. I took this snafu with a grain of salt, entered the rest of the ingredients manually on my desktop, and then synced the Epicurious account on my iDevices.\nThe app was of no help with the various sources of instructions for cooking the perfect turkey. Trussing is critical to this effort, and I continue to rely on the diagram (it\u2019s actually for trussing a chicken, but a turkey has the same basic anatomy) on pages 237-239 of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1, by Julia Child et al. (My copy of the book falls open to this page.) Other tips, from Bobby Flay, were originally published in the Nov. 22, 2002 issue of Newsweek, and are summarized here.\nAnother recipe that will not migrate to my iDevices is my grandmother\u2019s famous noodle pudding. As a child, I used to help her make it. First she let me crush the Sugar Frosted Flakes that she used for topping. When I got older, I was promoted to the job of running the KitchenAid mixer as she added the eggs, sugar and other ingredients.\nI still have a yellow index card, written in an insecure adolescent\u2019s script, with the recipe that she dictated to me. But a more cherished memento is a copy of the recipe in her own handwriting. She gave it to my sister-in-law, Lisa, welcoming her into our family. After Nanny (a name that stuck from the days when I couldn\u2019t pronounce \u201cGranny\u201d) died, Lisa duplicated it and gave each family member a laminated copy.\nThe Epicurious app has a feature that would allow me to type the noodle pudding recipe into my electronic recipe box. But doing that would expel Nanny from my kitchen. And I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.",

    "text": "The fifth guidebook in the \u2018Battle Lines\u2019 series focuses on one day, rather than a whole campaign or series of battles as the previous ones have done. The eleven routes provided in the book cover the length of the British front line on 1st July 1916, from Gommecourt in the north to Maricourt in the south. Over 170 sites, memorials, and cemeteries are included in the itinerary; this is no tokenistic tour of the main tourist spots, but a guide that will take the visitor well and truly off the beaten track.\nA brief historical overview is given as well as practical information about visiting the area \u2013 mainly covering accommodation. This part of the text is perhaps geared to the first time visitor to the area, who may not be familiar with the battlefields or the campaign, rather than the seasoned battlefields veteran.\nEach of the 11 routes has a summary including the distance and whether it can be done on foot, bike, or by car. A grading (either easy or moderate) and co-ordinates are also provided. A general description and context sets out the background to the route. A series of \u2018spine routes\u2019 connects the individual guides along the length of the front line. An approximate completion time for each route would have proved useful, but of course is dependent on how long the individual spends at each site (and how long they spend scouring the ground for shrapnel!).\nThe maps are uncluttered and clear and the instructions easy to follow. Each point of interest has additional context, with personal accounts and details of the men seamlessly interwoven in the style Cooksey and Murland have used to great effect in their previous offerings. Photos of the landscape and men supplement the text.\nI was particularly interested in the routes at the north and south of the British lines, as these are probably the lesser-visited areas of the Somme battlefield. I was pleased to see that they are covered in as much depth as the other areas, and have noted down a few points of interest for my own next visit.\nBrief appendices cover the memorial/grave locations of VC winners and poets, again perhaps catering to the \u2018tick list\u2019 of things to see for the first time visitor. Nevertheless, the core of this work provides a solid guide to the action that occurred on 1st July 1916 and many a visitor will benefit from the authors\u2019 knowledge and experience.",

    "text": "What exactly is point of sale technology? I like to think of it as the technology required to put money onto a prepaid wireless account. Sounds simple enough, but this can be quite a task to make it work smoothly and seamlessly. Here I will go over the high level detail that should both help you during your payment experience, as well as provide some additional information that prepaid wireless consumers may actually find interesting. For stores and dealers that sell airtime (also known as topup or replenishment), this section provides a pretty detailed discussion of the various terminal technology that you will encounter. So from both a customer and store/distributor perspective, knowledge of this topic will really help you with your prepaid wireless payment experience.\nThere are really two main sides to payment technology as I see it. The first is the side that you, the customer will see. The second is the back end technology that is invisible to you, but if it doesn't work properly can most certainly cause you (and the store) tremendous heartache. And there's no doubt that one's payment experience in a store can have a huge impact on our opinion of a wireless carrier, and even affect whether or not we decide to leave and try another provider. Here I'll focus on making payments using terminal technology as opposed to direct payment technology. Head over to the Adding Money section to review the details behind making cash payments as well as direct (i.e. virtual - credit card, debit card, eCheck) payment options.\nNote that point of sale technology specifically refers to technology that a clerk, employee, or manager uses to accept a payment in a particular store location. Believe it or not, there is a lot of complexity around payment technology. After all, if it doesn't work properly, and a payment is not posted to a customer's wireless account, service could be shut off, penalties accrued, and at the very least, the customer wastes a lot of time trying to figure out what happened to their money. Not to mention that wireless carriers and dealers spend money taking calls from confused, and even angry customers. Also, try not to let the simplicity of what you, the customer, see during a payment transaction fool you. The real-time technology that validates the account and posts the payment can really get complex.\nI would even say with confidence that prepaid wireless technology is even more complex than postpaid payment processing. I say that because with a postpaid wireless plan the carrier has a month to figure out your usage and to bill you. On the other hand, for a no contract, prepaid wireless plan, the technology must deduct money from your account in real time as you're making a call, downloading something, sending a text message, etc. Being balance aware in real time, as well as updating the usage on the billing system, and then disabling services in real time as funds are unavailable, really is no easy accomplishment. And when your phone service isn't working because you missed a payment, you definitely want it to be reactivated immediately once you are able to add funds to your account. Having worked in this field for over a decade, I can honestly tell you that at times it really does seem more complex than rocket science!\nBelow you'll find the categories that I feel are the most important to understand as you review point of sale technology.",

    "text": "Normally, it\u2019s an empty concrete breezeway with life-sized replicas of humpback whales suspended from the ceiling and the sounds of recorded whale song wafting in the air. It\u2019s a pedestrian throughway separating the Art Gallery and the Queensland Museum at Brisbane\u2019s Southbank, one that I walk briskly through in winter when it becomes a chilly concrete funnel for cold winds and one that I stroll slowly along when summer heat hangs in the air outside. Last Saturday, I spent the whole afternoon there. It had become a corridor of cycling chic, inspiration and fun.\nAs I walked up the stairs from the State Library, which was still recovering from Thursday\u2019s fierce storm, an amplified voice said, ..it\u2019s up to the people. If you want more bike lanes and better bikeways, you have to write to your politician. Politicians don\u2019t get much mail about it and if they don\u2019t get mail about it, nothing will happen. A program of speakers (in \u201cSpokers Corner\u201d) was in full swing.\nThe scent of fresh paint led my eyes to a line of seven bikes all painted stark white. Each had the beginnings of a colourful design and an artist concentrating on where the next brushstroke should be placed. I looked further along the normally empty passageway to see it filled with people, bikes and optimism. I\u2019d arrived at Pedal Brisbane, a day-long exhibition, a collaboration with the Queensland Museum, to celebrate, highlight and promote cycling culture.\n\u2026this exhibition carried a message of what cycling can become \u2013 a means of self-expression and a two-wheel journey to transforming individual lives, cities and societies. It\u2019s a grand vision but it\u2019s possible.\nIf your most familiar image of cyclists involves some combination of racing bikes, fast riding, sweaty lycra, large groups of cyclists on the weekend roads and in the coffee shops, then Pedal Brisbane added another vision. It highlighted the fringe of cycling culture that combines style and function to create a lifestyle of riding for transport, pleasure and exercise along the way.\nI saw bamboo bicycles, timber bikes, electric bikes for more speed with less sweat, foldaway bikes for people with limited space to store a bike, and a Dutch cargo bike for transporting small children and groceries and other goods in a stable two-wheel pedal powered carriage. It expressed the edge of cycling culture that involves innovation, art, design, film, photography, advocacy and initiatives to bring more people to bike riding, and bike riding to more people.\nFor me, the Pedal Brisbane exhibition carried a message of what cycling can become \u2013 a means of self-expression and a two-wheel journey to transforming individual lives, cities and societies. It\u2019s a grand vision but it\u2019s possible.\nIf you enjoyed this story, click \u2018Yes email me new stories\u2018 and receive new stories straight into your email inbox \ud83d\ude42 If you know other people who might enjoy it, use the icons below to share this story with them on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Google+, LinkedIn or via email. You can also read the About page to find out how this bike riding experiment began and why I\u2019m doing it.\nWell I feel relieved the project has started. The lead-up to it was coloured by growing anticipation about what would or could or might happen. Now, that it\u2019s Day Two, I feel more at ease. I\u2019m in it.\nIt\u2019s similar to when you stand on the shoreline looking at the cold water, working up the courage to dive in and anticipating the discomfort, the forfeiting of warmth. Then once you\u2019re in the water, it always feels better and most often not as uncomfortable as your pre-dive mind was anticipating. At least that\u2019s how it is in the sub-tropics where I live. Maybe if you\u2019re swimming in the Atlantic Ocean, it might be different but in the Coral Sea that laps the shorelines where I live, it\u2019s never really too cold to swim.\nSo now the project has begun, riding my bike is my first choice for transport. With no appointments to travel for, I\u2019d envisaged a car-free week. Yes! This will be a great start to the project. Yet, it is only day two of this experiment and an unexpected turn arrives.\nReplacing the car\u2019s bike rack has been on the list for the last twelve months. It moved up the list last week and so I drove out to look, try and hopefully buy. Those plans didn\u2019t go as thought. The model I was looking at wasn\u2019t in stock and there were some doubts about whether that style of rack would fit the car and still allow enough space for the rear gate to open. The Thule \u2018rep\u2019 would call me next week.\nIt was a quick call. He had a display bike rack to test the fit. Could I meet him?\nYes, I replied, I can meet you.\nIt\u2019s three days until this experiment begins. There\u2019s been an internal countdown happening over the last eight days, with sharper intensity as each day passes. I find myself doing things this week with the car that I think will be more difficult once the experiment begins next Monday, like collecting the wall planner that I had copied and laminated at Officeworks for 2015. Although in hindsight, it may not have been as difficult as I first thought because the chart was small enough to roll and would have fitted into my pannier with its top poking out, unless there was rain, and then I would have needed to improvise some waterproofing.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much that I can do in advance. So with three days to go, I\u2019m wondering where this experiment will take me.",

    "text": "Pictures and songs float through my head- for every moment in life there\u2019s a soundtrack that accompanies it, no matter whether it\u2019s the grandest of days or the (seemingly) most insignificant of moments. Words and images have the power to heal and bring you back to the place you were in life. Whether it\u2019s dancing in the family room with your BFFs to Sir-Mix-a-Lot, the moment you figured out the (too cute and smart for his own good) boy would only serve to mess with your head, the afternoon spent on the beach drinking mimosas with a friend that knows your heart or the sweet (and moderately embarrassing) moment of your first kiss\u2026 Name a memory and I can sing you a tune.\nAnd so with much ado and a wee bit of dramatic flair, I am happy to bring you a hot new blog post, complete with the perfect tune. So feel free to crank up this song in the background and let your heart be moved.\nHeather and Noel have perfected the art of seamlessly fading into one another \u2013 becoming one heart and soul, both independently strong and unique, but unstoppable together. Their love and peace with one another is inspiring and the way they look at one another is enough to melt the coldest heart.\nAnd their wedding day? Well, you can bet that was pretty fantastic too \u2013 full of laughter, sunshine and salt air. I am so excited to share a few highlights from their day. Enjoy!\nHappy fall, y\u2019all! It\u2019s time for a quick flashback to earlier this summer for a few highlights from Amber & Andrew\u2019s wedding. They were married on the beach in Destin, Florida and partied all day and night with their closest family and friends. They were blessed with a stunning Southern sunset, cool gulf breezes and lots of puppy kisses. Here are a few highlights from their day!\nWell, hello there! It\u2019s been a long, hot summer, which has been perfect for me to wrap up galleries and albums and take a little family vacation time. Now that summer is coming to an end, it\u2019s time to start thinking about all the fun that\u2019s to be had this fall! We have a little over a month until we kick things off with Heather and Noel\u2019s wedding, so why don\u2019t we go ahead and share a few favorite images from Lauren and Andrew?\nTheir big day took place on St. George Island this past June and was full of salt, sun and lots of fun! Their family and friends came from afar to toast the couple and dance the night away. We snuck away for a few beach sunset photos and rode around the island on the golf cart, savoring the last inkling of light before dancing the night away. Looking back at these photographs makes me smile as I think about what a great summer it\u2019s been. Here are a few of my favorites. Enjoy!\nSummer is here and the first wedding season of the year is drawing to a close rapidly (how did that happen?). In the midst of editing, I figured it was time to hit pause and share a few images from a recent wedding that absolutely pulled on my heart strings \u2013 Courtney & Jeff\u2019s elegant Seaside wedding. After a touching first look in Watercolor, they said \u201cI Do\u201d at the Seaside Chapel and danced the night away in Ruskin Park. Throughout the day, there was lots of love and laughter \u2013 from the expressions of the bridesmaids when they were spying (from a distance) on Courtney and Jeff\u2019s first look, to the tears of joy and love in Jeff\u2019s eyes as he saw his bride walk down the aisle.\nA huge thanks to Defining Moments by Heather for putting together an amazing event and to Courtney, Jeff, and their families for being so warm and welcoming.",

    "text": "The original Tea Between Friends is a great thread....but let's start a new one!\nWhat are you working on? What do you have for printers? Share your 2019 goals?\nI'm working to get all of these 3D Printers reliable. That means proper power supplies for some, better extruders, hot ends and various other upgrades.\nMy goal...which has eluded me for a while...the BB-8 build!\nI need to get all of these printers making good parts for the build. Most prints take 36 hours or more, so we can't have beds with adhesion issues, randomly slipping extruders and iffy hotends.\nUltimaker 2+ - I wish these weren't so expensive as I really think everyone should start with one! I've just replaced the coupler a while back, it was sorely in need of replacing. It's my \"pretty much can print anything without drama\" printer.\nCR-10 - The original! It's printed several BB-8 domes and various large pieces. I accumulated a lot of spare parts to upgrade this to the CR-10S electronics and send Z lead screw. It'll be upgraded with an EZABL bed sensor and I'm not sure if I will put a MicroSwiss all metal hot end or trying something else.\nCR-10S - I paid a little extra to get mine from PrintedSolid and they made the electronic fix identified with early CR-10S models It's worked great. It has the EZABL and a MicroSwiss hot end. I recently installed the SeeMeCNC EZR Struder and so far, no under extrusion woes!\nGeeeTech A10 - This printer was a mess out of the box. Weeks later, after much badgering and hounding...they sent some replacement parts. However it took a lot of hacking to get the thing to print, even carving up the X gantry for a better quality lead screw coupler to fit! BUT...it's actually printing very very well....fingers crossed!\nTevo Tornado - I don't have a lot of time on this printer since every time I have used it, it has been a disaster to sort out. While removing and replacing the bed screws, the bed shattered....so...this one has a ways to go!\nFolgerTech FT-5 R1 - The one I had high hopes for still sits idle. However, with new 713Maker bed, heated bed and some additional changes, I think we can get this big guy printing really well.\nFolgerTech i3 Mega - It was a wonderful kit to put together and despite a few minor changes I made, it's printing well! It's getting a Titan Aero with EZABL this week, so I can begin dialing that in!\nLast Saturday we had the monthly opening of the Repair Cafe here in my town where I volunteer. Since most of the volunteers are older guys that are interested in all kinds of technology but had never seen a 3D printer in action, I packed my little Fabrikator Mini and a roll of filament to my usual tools.\nI set it up in a corner of the workshop and had it print shopping card coins with the Repair Cafe logo. It was a big success. A lot of the guys and a few visitors/customers watched the little printer and informed themselves about 3D printing.\nI too am working on one of my 3D Printers that is experiencing layer shifting. after a power supply died in a shower of sparks.\nIt is not like the normal layer shift, this layer shift has something to do with the Z-Axis as they occur at exactly the same height.\nNow the first replies state that this is normally what happens when we have binding. Though I have rebuild the X,Y and Z Axis.\nReplacing all bearings cleaning all smooth rods and lead screws re-lubing and thinking that the some be warped.\nI swapped them side to side and end for end, if this was the problem the layer shift would still occur thou should at a different location.\nThis was not the case it still occurs and at exactly the same location, Have even reposition-ed the model with the exact layer Shift.\nI have tried to get the all Axis as smooth as possible with little to no effect. So the Next step is to trade the smooth rods from Red to Blu.\nRed and Blu are the name I have given my 3D Printers. And Blu is the one giving me the trouble.\nWell If I decide to get into the 3D printer to experience a learning process I have made it!\nOh. I guess should mention that the layer shift is so minute, unlike other I have seen.\nTop of model shows the worst layer shift, bottom shows average layer shifting.\nHave a separate thread if anyone has any thoughts.\nI have only been in the 3D printing game about a year and a half. My work involves designing just about anything, from cosmetic brushes to plastic injection mould tools. 3D printing has always played a part, first using companies like Shapeways etc. until someone bought me a Floger FT5 (R1) he must be a bit sadistic. I had never even seen a 3D printer before so it was quite a learning curve putting it together, with forums like this helping me, thanks guys.\nNow I am getting decent prints most of the time for use with work and fun. I ordered a JGaurora A5s before Christmas, but it never arrived, Santa must have got lost looking for our house.\nI have ordered another from China and it should come next week.\nThe idea is to have a printer that just prints without too much trouble, we shall see, it has good reviews.\nI had to persuade the wife to let me spend the money, I am sure it will be worth it.\nI have learned a lot about 3D printing and still have a lot to learn, but it's been fun, well most of the time. I am sure you will agree, when you get a difficult part to print it gives you a great sense of achievement.\nThe JGAurora A5S arrived yesterday, the day that it was supposed to. The printer is very easy to put together and has good instructions.\nAs the printer had been tested there was a tiny bit of plastic still on the nozzle that I never noticed, so after leveling the bed the first print lifted off the bed. Reset the bed leveling and got a perfect print from the sample on the SD card. Printed a baby Groot and it looks perfect too.\nI am very happy with this printer, less than an hour to get everything up and running, from when the box arrived. I'll be trying larger prints to see how it performs.\nI thought of buying the TH3D clone, the \"Tough End\" Aero setup but I prefer the cartridge style thermosistor over the bulb type that are so problematic at times.\nUpdate on the JGAuora A5S.\nThe bed has a slight \"hump\" in the middle, only about 0.1mm, too small to cause any problems.\nAfter a few prints the touch on the touch screen stopped working, so I had to connect it up to the PC to get it to work.\nI contacted support and they asked me to check the connections to the LCD screen, they looked fine but I still tried to push them in a bit more. Screen works now. I like the black diamond bed, it works with PLA and PETG, not tried any other filaments yet. Just keep the bed clean with alcohol and when the bed cools down the prints lift off.\nFor me it's just what I need, a large printer that is reliable and easy to use.\nThere is a good community on Facebook and a wiki forum.\nI'll probably keep the Folger FT5 for the more smelly prints as it's in the garage.\nSo I'll be doing more prints in 2019.\nI made enormous progress on my Titan Aero upgrade to my FolgerTech i3 Mega...got it all amounted and wired....then I ran the belts into the \"tear drop\" shaped loops for the belt to go in. I struggled to tension the belt enough and press it inside the oval area to insert them. I was one belt notch loose and tried to tug the belt a bit tighter...then pop...the tear drop shaped piece of plastic popped out. Aahhhh.\nDon't you just Hate it when that happens!\nHave not been here much lots of snow, an still playing with Marlin 2.0.x new features to determine which will work best with my 3D Printer.\nYesterday the Layer Shift got extremely bad. This happened with a combination of Marlin 2.x, Cura 4 and low V-Ref.\nThe 3D Printer with the Layer shifting has every axis flowing smoother the the working 3D Printer and still layer shifts.\nEven though I was told not to I adjusted V-Ref up to about the same percentage my other printer is using, then most Layer shifting went away.\nIt was completely stumping me as to why could 3D Print circular objects perfectly though square or rectangular objects seem to layer shift.\nThen after upgrading to Marlin 2.0.x this sudden jump in layer shifting. Not so bad now though still a tiny shifting occurring on the Y-Axis.\nAnd this could be because I could not perfectly align the Z-Couplers.\nIt appears that my Hot-end needs rebuilt, getting weak, takes a little more to flow the filament, curved edges rolling from the base are under extruded not making smooth round curves from the base upward.",

    "text": "Welcome to the 5L40E transmission sale. This General Motors built 5 speed automatic can be found in the BMW, Cadillac, Pontiac, Holden, Saturn and GMC's in the early to mid 2000's. Even though the 5L40E was used in high performance luxury vehicles it was known to have a few inherent problems. As the transmission begins to accumulate miles it becomes prone to lubrication contamination which can end up causing a complete fluid loss. The electrical system, sensors, solenoids and thin coated wires are a common failure point. Erratic shift patterns, overheating and speedometer calibration have all frustrated users of the 5L40E for decades.\nThe XP1 series is not a rebuilt 5L40E, it is a completely remanufactured OEM replacement transmission that utilizes the implementation of upgraded parts to rectify the 5L40-E transmissions inherent flaws. From its performance built lock up torque converter to the state of the art solenoids and valve bodies, you can rest assured that this will be the last 5L40E transmission your vehicle ever needs.\nFar from just being rebuilt, the Xtreme Performance series 1 is an OEM replacement that has been fully remanufactured with upgraded parts that have been designed to increase performance, reliability and longevity.",

    "text": "For a long time in the anime, Ash had a Greninja that was a fan-favorite. So when I came across a deck featuring Greninja-GX FLI 24, I knew I had to take a look at it. I found it posted on the PokeBeach Forums by a user named MegaAbsol10. It was played by Alexandre Sole to a Top 8 finish at SPE Bolzano (seniors). Let's take a look at the deck.\nWith Greninja-GX FLI 24, you're able to put three damage counters on any of your opponent's Pokemon thanks to its Shuriken Flurry Ability. This can be especially useful after your opponent has retreated a damaged Pokemon that's on its last legs. You can use this ability repeatedly by attacking with Haze Slash, which also happens to deal 110 damage in addition to shuffling Greninja-GX FLI 24 and all attached cards into your deck. Frogadier FLI 23's Gale Shuriken Ability is similar to Shuriken Flurry, but deals one less damage. While these abilities may be a little slow, it's important to evolve so that you get this extra damage and make it easier to knock out your opponent's Pokemon quickly.\nThe Freezing Gaze Ability of Glaceon-GX UPR 39 makes it so that your opponent's Pokemon have no effect. This is especially great when facing Lycanroc-GX GRI 74 as you don't have to worry as much about having your Active Pokemon switched with a Pokemon from your bench that might not be as powered up. But Lycanroc-GX GRI 74 isn't the only Pokemon this affects. Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60, Zeraora-GX LOT 86, and Zoroark-GX SLG 53 all have great abilities that are nullified by Freezing Gaze. Glaceon-GX UPR 39 also has the Frost Bullet attack that deals 30 damage directly to an opponent's Benched Pokemon while also dealing 90 damage to their Active Pokemon. KO'ing two Pokemon with one attack is quite possible with Frost Bullet.\nWith Marshadow SLG 45's Let Loose Ability, you're able to disrupt your opponent's plan after they've begun to sculpt their hand. It can also help you as a way to draw cards when you've played your hand out and have less than four cards in hand. You'll never be able to attack with Marshadow SLG 45 though, as it's Shadow Punch attack requires Psychic Energy, which you don't have access to in this deck.\nWhile you only have a single copy of Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60, playing it allows you to search your deck for any Supporter there. As you'll see, the Supporters in this deck all help you draw additional cards or help set up favorable attacks. All are powerful effects, and having a copy of Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60 can help you find what you need quicker. In a pinch, you can also use Energy Drive as an attack thanks to it only requiring colorless Energy.\nLillie UPR 125, Cynthia UPR 119, and Guzma BUS 115 are all of the Supporters in this deck. Lillie UPR 125 is best when played on your first turn, but she's still good even later in the game. Cynthia UPR 119 is a great way to draw a new hand of cards when you have things that are not as useful in your hand or when you have only a couple of cards left. With Guzma BUS 115, you have a great way to set up an attack that allows you to knock out two of your opponent's Pokemon with one Frost Bullet attack.\nHere's a group of cards that allow you either to search for specific cards you need, or to discard specific cards to your discard pile. Nest Ball SUM 123 can only find a Basic Pokemon, so it's very limited. On the other hand, Ultra Ball SUM 135 can find any Pokemon you need. Both Ultra Ball SUM 135 and Acro Bike CES 123 will put cards into your discard pile, and you might want to consider putting a Water Energy 3 or two there for use later.\nAqua Patch GRI 119 is the reason you might want a couple of Water Energy 3s in your discard pile. It allows you to power up a Benched Water Type Pokemon very quickly.\nSwitch SUM 132 helps you move up a Pokemon that you've powered up with Aqua Patch GRI 119 and allows you to retreat a wounded Pokemon without paying the retreat cost.\nEven though you might have shut off their Abilities with Glaceon-GX UPR 39's Freezing Gaze Ability, many Pokemon-GX still have powerful attacks. One of the best way to deal with a Pokemon that has an attack you'd rather not have them using against you is to knock them out before they can use it. Choice Band GRI 121 helps you do that by dealing out a little bit of additional damage, which could be the difference between knocking the Pokemon-GX out or allowing it to get one last attack.\nSuper Scoop Up BUS 124 offers you a way to return a Pokemon you have in play and all cards attached to it into your hand so that you can play it again. It's a great way to utilize Greninja-GX FLI 24's Shuriken Flurry Ability multiple times. It can also help you deny your opponent the chance to draw one (or more) of their Prize cards. Rescue Stretcher GRI 130 allows you a way to get Greninja-GX FLI 24 back if it happens to get knocked out.\nIf you're looking for a deck that has the ability to knock out multiple Pokemon with a single attack, you should give this deck a try. It's a proven deck that looks like a lot of fun to play.\nThank you to PokeBeach.com Forum user MegaAbsol10 for posting this decklist, and congratulations to Alexandre Sole on the Top 8 finish.",

    "text": "Pediatric pituitary adenomas are rare, accounting for <3 % of all childhood intracranial tumors, the majority of which are prolactinomas. Consequently, they are often misdiagnosed as other suprasellar masses such as craniopharyngiomas in this age group. Whilst guidelines exist for the treatment of adult prolactinomas, the management of childhood presentations of these benign tumors is less clear, particularly when dopamine agonist therapy fails. Given their rarity, childhood-onset pituitary adenomas are more likely to be associated with a variety of genetic syndromes, the commonest being multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1).\nWe present a case of an early-onset, treatment-resistant giant prolactinoma occurring in an 11-year-old peripubertal boy that was initially sensitive, but subsequently highly resistant to dopamine agonist therapy, ultimately requiring multiple surgical debulking procedures and proton beam irradiation. Our patient is now left with long-term tumor- and treatment-related neuroendocrine morbidities including blindness and panhypopituitarism. Only after multiple consultations and clinical data gained from 20-year-old medical records was a complex, intergenerationally consanguineous family history revealed, compatible with MEN-1, with a splice site mutation (c.784-9G\u2009>\u2009A) being eventually identified in intron 4 of the MEN1 gene, potentially explaining the difficulties in management of this tumor. Genetic counseling and screening has now been offered to the wider family.\nThis case emphasizes the need to consider pituitary adenomas in the differential diagnosis of all pediatric suprasellar tumors by careful endocrine assessment and measurement of at least a serum prolactin concentration. It also highlights the lack of evidence for the optimal management of pediatric drug-resistant prolactinomas. Finally, the case we describe demonstrates the importance of a detailed family history and the role of genetic testing for MEN1 and AIP mutations in all cases of pediatric pituitary adenoma.\nPituitary adenomas account for <3 % of all childhood intracranial tumors with an estimated incidence of 0.1 cases/million/year [1, 2]. Prolactin (PRL)-secreting tumors alone account for 50-70 % of pituitary adenomas in children <20 years of age [3\u20135]. These are further classified into microprolactinomas (\u22641 cm in maximum dimensions), macroprolactinomas (>1 cm) and giant prolactinomas (>4 cm with a serum PRL of >5300-10600 mU/l) [6, 7]. First-line therapy consists of dopamine agonists such as cabergoline, with surgery and radiotherapy being reserved for drug-resistant tumors or neuro-ophthalmological emergencies. Whilst 20-30 % of patients with known multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) develop prolactinomas [4, 8, 9], up to 6.5 % of sporadic pediatric prolactinomas are associated with previously undiagnosed MEN-1 .\nWe report a patient presenting to our quaternary pediatric neuroendocrine and oncology units with a treatment-resistant giant prolactinoma. His complex genetic history and challenging management illustrates the necessity for thorough history-taking, specialist multidisciplinary management and the potential for long-term neuroendocrine morbidity in this rare tumor.\nAn 11-year-old Middle Eastern boy was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children with four years of headaches and 18 months of visual deterioration, previously investigated with a reportedly normal brain CT scan in his country of origin. There was no galactorrhea. At presentation he had a right-sided relative afferent pupillary defect, optic atrophy and could only perceive light with his right eye and count fingers with his left eye. Auxology was normal and he was in early puberty with testicular volumes of 4 mls bilaterally. Initial family history revealed an inter-generational multiply consanguineous family (Fig. 1a), with one maternal first half-cousin once removed treated with cabergoline at age 18 years and one paternal first half-cousin once removed undergoing transsphenoidal surgery at age 45 years, both for macroprolactinomas.\nMagnetic resonance imaging revealed a large, avidly-enhancing heterogeneous sellar and suprasellar mass merging with the pituitary gland, compressing the optic chiasm and encasing both internal carotid arteries with a maximal transverse diameter of 5.5 cm (Fig. 2a-b). A provisional radiological diagnosis of craniopharyngioma was made with a plan for surgical resection. However, biochemical testing revealed marked hyperprolactinemia (PRL 23723 mU/l, normal range 55-318) leading to the revised diagnosis of a giant prolactinoma. Dynamic testing revealed deficiencies in growth hormone (GH, peak to glucagon stimulation 1.1 ng/ml; insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) 196 ng/ml, normal range 143-693) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH 3.7 mU/l, normal range <6.0; free thyroxine (fT4) 10.3 pmol/l, normal range 10.8-19.0) but normal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (peak cortisol 516 nmol/l to synacthen stimulation) and -gonadal function (luteinizing hormone 0.3 U/l, follicle-stimulating hormone 0.9 U/l, testosterone 1.68 nmol/l).\nOur patient was commenced on 250 \u03bcg/week cabergoline and levothyroxine supplementation. Despite an initial excellent PRL reduction in response to therapy, his tumor became extremely drug-resistant despite cabergoline dose escalation to 3.5 mg/week (Fig. 2m). Multiple relapses threatening vision required two transcranial interhemispheric debulking procedures and adjuvant proton beam irradiation, with the second debulking and radiotherapy undertaken at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP, Fig. 2c-l). Tumor histology confirmed a prolactinoma with a high Ki67 index (11 %). During the second surgical debulking he experienced a preoperative anesthesia-related hemorrhagic stroke causing a transient left hemiparesis, and post-operatively lost all residual vision. He now has panhypopituitarism but has demonstrated declining PRL concentrations (500 mU/l) whilst maintained on 5 mg/week of cabergoline.\nHis complex family history alerted clinicians to the likelihood of an underlying genetic diagnosis but despite repeated consultations with multiple specialists (HAS, MK, OJ) no common ancestor linking all three macroprolactinoma cases could be found. Genetic testing of our patient for both MEN1 and AIP mutations revealed a heterozygous MEN1 intronic splice site mutation (c.784-9G\u2009>\u2009A). This has previously been shown to result in alternative splicing, a premature stop codon and a truncated, inactive MENIN protein [11\u201313].\nSubsequent questioning revealed a history of renal stones and primary hyperparathyroidism in our patient\u2019s mother and two maternal aunts, as well as a history consistent with MEN-1 (macroprolactinoma, primary hyperparathyroidism and gastrinoma) in his deceased maternal grandmother (Fig. 1b) who had been managed by our adult colleagues in the United Kingdom two decades earlier. Genetic testing confirmed the same mutation in his sister, mother, maternal grandmother, one maternal aunt and her two children, but not in his father or his paternal uncle. Most recently, our patient has developed primary hyperparathyroidism, and a parathyroidectomy is being planned. He continues to undergo regular screening including gut hormone profiling and echocardiograms at CHOP, all of which have been normal thus far. We are in the process of collaboratively tracing and screening other asymptomatic relatives in the wider family at risk.\nThe rarity of pediatric pituitary adenomas means that they are often not considered in the differential diagnosis of suprasellar tumors in this age group, leading to the potential misdiagnoses of craniopharyngioma or low-grade glioma, for which primary treatments are predominantly surgical, chemotherapeutic and/ or radiotherapeutic in nature. This case highlights the importance of a routine endocrine evaluation in all such cases, not only to document potential tumor-related pituitary dysfunction but also to identify functioning pituitary adenomas by measuring serum PRL, GH and adrenocorticotropic hormone, particularly as non-functioning pituitary adenomas are rare in children [14, 15, 5]. It also emphasizes that macroprolactinomas often present with non-endocrine raised intracranial pressure symptoms particularly in prepubertal males [16\u201319, 15]. It is important to distinguish true prolactinomas from hyperprolactinemia from other causes, but concentrations >5300 mU/l are usually diagnostic . In all suspected cases, screening for macroprolactinemia , as well as serial serum dilution to exclude the hook effect \u2013 where extreme hyperprolactinemia causes falsely low assay results through interference of antibody-antigen complex formation [6, 21] \u2013 should always be performed.\nMedical monotherapy with dopamine agonists is recommended as first-line treatment for all prolactinomas due to their excellent efficacy, likely preservation of residual pituitary function and low side-effect profile [7, 22]. Cabergoline in particular has an established record of being better-tolerated than bromocriptine with higher rates of resolution . Cardiac valve regurgitation with high cumulative doses (4000 mg) has been described in Parkinson syndrome patients , but this is usually not reached with prolactinomas, as demonstrated by several adult studies [7, 24\u201327]. However, young patients such as ours commencing treatment earlier in life are more likely to reach this critical threshold, and at the current dose of 5 mg/week our patient will be exposed to 4000 mg of cabergoline within 16 years post-diagnosis, unless doses can be reduced in response to the efficacy of radiotherapy. Dose-safety profiles have additionally not been established in children, in whom toxicity even at moderate cabergoline doses may be increased. Quinagolide, a more recent non-ergot derived dopamine agonist is purported to have fewer side effects but to our knowledge has not been used in children .\nThe mechanism for development of drug-resistance is not well understood, and is thought to relate to dopamine D2 receptor downregulation . MEN-1 is associated with larger tumors (84 % vs. 24 %) and treatment-resistance (56 % vs. 10 %) [29, 9]. Second-line management options for drug-resistant adult tumors include maximizing cabergoline dose to 11 mg/week, transsphenoidal or transcranial surgical resection, radiotherapy and the alkylating agent temozolomide [7, 6, 30, 31]. However, knowledge of the maximum safe therapeutic cabergoline dose, speed of dose escalation, long-term toxicities of temozolomide, and experience in pediatric transsphenoidal resections is limited. Consequently, optimal management of pediatric pituitary adenomas remains unclarified, suggesting the need for treatment in specialist neuroendocrine units with both adult and pediatric experience. Several authors report long-term tumor- and/ or treatment-related morbidities including hypopituitarism, obesity, dyslipidemia, infertility and reduced bone mineral density [16\u201318, 32, 6, 3].\n9-22 % of pediatric pituitary adenomas are associated with genetic tumor-predisposing syndromes, the most well-known of which is MEN-1 with an estimated prevalence of 0.02-0.2 per 1000 [10, 29]. Whilst primary hyperparathyroidism is the commonest presenting manifestation, 17 % will present with a pituitary adenoma (classically a prolactinoma) . As illustrated here, MEN-1 is an autosomal dominant condition characterized additionally by enteropancreatic tumors, non-functioning adrenocortical adenomas, angiofibromas, collagenomas, thyroid adenomas, meningiomas and other neuroendocrine tumors . Other genetic endocrine syndromes associated with pituitary tumors are the familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) syndrome (of which AIP mutations are a subset), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (CDKN1B), Carney complex (PRKAR1A), McCune-Albright syndrome (GNAS), SDH-related pituitary adenoma syndrome (SDHB, SDHC, SDHD), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and DICER1 syndrome [33, 34, 4, 35\u201337].\nSeveral authors strongly suggest testing for both MEN1 and AIP germline mutations in all pediatric patients with PRL- and GH-secreting pituitary adenomas as they may be index cases for a given family [10, 33, 29]. A useful algorithm has been proposed by Korbonits et al. (2012). This is particularly important given that current guidelines recommend testing first-degree relatives of index cases and performing annual biochemical screening in carriers for insulinomas, PRL- and GH-secreting pituitary adenomas from age 5 years and for hyperparathyroidism from age 8 years .\nPituitary adenomas must be considered in the differential diagnosis of all pediatric suprasellar masses, therefore mandating a detailed endocrine review and an accurate serum PRL measurement as management differs markedly from that of other tumors. Optimal management of dopamine agonist-resistant tumors in childhood remains unclear. A detailed family history of brain tumors and MEN-1-associated symptoms such as renal stones must be obtained and may require several consultations before being fully elucidated. We recommend that all children with PRL- or GH-secreting pituitary adenomas undergo MEN1 and AIP mutation testing, with subsequent screening of first-degree relatives if found positive.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the parent of the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.\nWe are very grateful to the patient and his family for consenting to the publication of his clinical and family history data. We are also thankful to Sian Conner, Niloofar Bozorgi and Rhonda Thomas for their assistance in obtaining clinical notes and radiological images.\nHWG & CB obtained informed patient/parental consent, collated clinical, biochemical, radiological and genetic data, as well as drafted the manuscript. OJ was involved in the initial surgical care of the patient. MAL was involved in the endocrine management and follow-up of the patient, provided useful clinical, biochemical and radiological data. MK was involved in the genetic diagnosis, identifying and tracing of the family history, counseling and care of the patient and his family, providing detailed genetic and family data. HAS was involved in the endocrine diagnosis and management of the patient, interpretation of endocrine biochemistry and provided useful clinical data. All authors contributed to the edition and finalization of the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",

    "text": "Over the last 10 years or so Amy Seimetz as emerged as one of the most interesting actors and filmmakers out there. She made her mark on horror fans with a dazzling break-out turn in Adam Wingard\u2019s A Horrible Way To Die, starred in Shane Carruth\u2019s superb (and uncategorisable) Upstream Color and appeared in the likes of You\u2019re Next and The Sacrament. She recently co-created and co-directed the acclaimed TV series of The Girlfriend Experience, and has been making an impact in big mainstream movies like Alien: Covenant and TV shows like Stranger Things.\nNow, Seimetz is starring as Rachel Creed in Kevin K\u00f6lsch and Dennis Widmyer\u2019s remake of Pet Sematary, diving into extremely dark material as the Creed family is faced with the dire consequences of ignoring the rule that \u201csometimes dead is better\u2026\u201d, and we took the chance to talk all things King.\nWhat was it about this new take that appealed to you?\nI was sort of pushed by Dennis and Kevin to do it and I was a big fan of their first film, Starry Eyes, I just really liked how they dealt with tone and atmosphere and genre in general so I was excited to see what they would do with their remake. In addition to that, the conversations that we had before I agreed to do it were exploring what was already so strong in the book. Even though it\u2019s genre and scary, it was trying to bring out the honesty of grief and loss in the characters and that was so interesting to me.\nWere you familiar with the story already?\nSo I\u2019d read the book before I saw the movie which was kind of around the same time when the movie came out, \u201988 or \u201989, I saw the movie as an eight year old and was extremely disturbed both times! I saw the movie in the theatre with my mom. [Watching the movie] is a different relationship, reading a book is so intimate and you\u2019re left with your own thoughts with the book, it\u2019s like a personal relationship\u2026which is very disturbing when you\u2019re eight and you read something so honest and scary, and not scary necessarily in a zombie way but scary in an \u201cOh my god, adults are really fucked up!\u201d way!\nAnd then of course the original movie being such a great horror iconic horror movie and so fun, I had a different relationship with the movie. It was interesting because I wasn\u2019t sure if I would have directed it that way! Maybe it was the first thought that I had because it was the first time I had read a book and then watched the movie\u2026 But I loved the ending scene, when I decided to do it my sister was like \u201cOh my god, do you get to do that scene where your eyeball\u2019s falling out when you kiss your husband?!?\u201d She was very excited about it!\nThese very, very honest moments in the book that I find incredibly intimate, it\u2019s really well written and it\u2019s more of a character study and a study on family and relationships than it is even a genre book. Because the horror doesn\u2019t really kick in until later, you know, you\u2019re so intimate with this couple and this guy who\u2019s a husband and a father and you\u2019re in his head. And once it gets into the grieving and talking about loss, I just found it to be very honest and accurate in a lot of ways. Even with the character, her desire to deny that death is coming or that death is inevitable. Just that avoidance that she has is really interesting.\nRachel has a lot of trauma in her past but she keeps it bottled up. What was your way in for the character?\nIn particular there\u2019s this one passage that I always point to in the book when she reveals to Louis what it was like growing up for the first time and she hasn\u2019t really talked about it with him before. And once she starts talking about it\u2019s almost like the dam has broken and this flood of memories coming out about her sister. Throughout the book she wants to deny it and then there\u2019s this one passage where she starts sharing with her husband what happened. And it\u2019s so descriptive and so moment-to-moment in her behaviour of what that\u2019s like, she goes from laughing to crying to anger, all of the emotions that you have within grieving and trauma, this rollercoaster of emotions.\nI just found that extremely helpful and extremely insightful into exploring the character so it\u2019s not just one note, so it isn\u2019t just always \u201cOh, I\u2019m so traumatised\u2019 and just crying all the time. That grief comes in so many different shapes and forms, it comes in maniacal laughter sometimes. Sometimes dark, inappropriate observations that you say out loud, to find the different shades of grieving and trauma in Rachel was where I was interested but that passage helped a lot in the book.\nWe were so excited when John Lithgow was announced as Jud! What was it like working with him?\nI\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re so excited about John Lithgow! He is the best. I keep saying this and I really hope that people don\u2019t think I\u2019m just saying this because when people talk about people in interviews they\u2019re like \u201cOh he\u2019s the best!\u201d But he really is the best! Maybe one of my favourite human beings I\u2019ve ever met. Everything that you would want John Lithgow to be, John Lithgow is. The kindest, and warmest and smartest. He never complains, is always a professional, is always a joy to be around and in addition to that obviously he\u2019s done so many iconic performances that he was a delight to work with.\nHow did you find the process of working with joint directors on this?\nIt was interesting because I really liked Starry Eyes and I hadn\u2019t worked with co-directors before. And admittedly going into it I was very wary of it as a director myself because everything\u2019s filtered through me and I\u2019m in control! But they\u2019ve got it down, they\u2019ve got their whole co-directing down to an art. It\u2019s interesting because their temperaments are very different but each person has their own way of directing to this cohesive vision of the piece.\nDennis is very into rhythm and the musicality of a performance, of hitting a mark and hitting this beat and hitting this line at this point in sort of what I would describe as the musicality of a genre performance. Whereas Kevin gives these very specific notes, like \u201cMaybe if you hold your hand right here this will put your body in such a way that will evoke a specific performance.\u201d So he\u2019s much more into these very specific notes but each of those notes are adding to the bigger piece that is their shared vision for the film, it\u2019s just a different approach to it and a different way of directing but the final thing that they\u2019re trying to get to, they\u2019re very much on the same page. I never saw them disagree with anything that we were trying to do. There was never any argument, they work extremely well together.\nYour career is obviously not limited to horror and genre movies but you\u2019ve done some amazing work in it. Is there something in particular that you like exploring in this area?\nI\u2019m attracted to genre because you can get weird with it and you can explore these topics like grief and loss in extremely creative ways and it doesn\u2019t feel melodramatic but you can go hard towards melodrama. It\u2019s very heightened situations and you can explore these topics without it feeling preachy or pedantic. You can just go to these really weird dark places and get kind of abstract in a way without losing an audience. You can hold your audience through really artful and bizarre and dark twists and turns in a way that with straight drama you might lose your audience. Because you\u2019re working with this trope or construct of genre you can kind of get away with exploring extremely weird and uncharted territory while still holding your audience and bringing them on an exciting ride.\nYou\u2019ve recently worked on some huge studio movies and shows. How do you find the experience of going from an indie set to a mega-budget production?\nBut my very first day of shooting Alien: Covenant in New Zealand, I was so nervous and it was Ridley Scott, he\u2019s amazing and lovely but I was so nervous. Not only that, but the whole day was only me, shooting only me alone. The very first day of shooting on this giant movie, it was just me alone on a planet tinkering at my spaceship. Which\u2026that sentence alone is hilarious! [laughs] And so I was really nervous but it sort of dawned on me and I talked to Ridley about it, no matter what the size of the movie, once they say \u201caction\u201d it always just comes down to the actor and the camera and the sound. It just goes straight to the basics really quickly. So in terms of the difference in performing for an indie movie or a giant studio movie, once the camera starts rolling it\u2019s very quickly the same exact thing, you\u2019re bringing the same exact thing to the screen. Even if they have magnificent toys to support the whole thing.",

    "text": "Herceptin - Trastuzumab samen met de chemo combinatie anthracycline/docetaxel en/of docetaxel/carboplatin geeft een hoog significante verbetering in de ziektevrije tijd van borstkankerpati\u00ebnten met Her2-Neu overexpressie. De bijwerkingen waren in alle drie de groepen nagenoeg gelijk. Wel was er verschil in hartklachten tussen de drie groepen maar deze lijken te voorkomen door een goede analyse vooraf en een goede begeleiding tijdens de kuur. In onderstaand artikel wordt dit uitgelegd maar we missen de kennis om dit ook in goed Nederlands te vertalen. Dus laten het zo in het Engels staan. Deze studie is de eerste die bewijst dat Herceptin in combinatie met een niet zo geheten taxane chemo (taxol bv.) een significante verbetering in resultaten geeft. Deze studie werd deze week gepresenteerd op het 28e jaarlijkse San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Onderstaand artikel spreekt verder voor zich nemen we aan.\nInterim data from BCIRG 006 show significant improvements in disease-free survival with anthracycline/docetaxel/trastuzumab and docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab By Claire Sowerbutt December 09, 2005 Efficacy data from the first interim analysis of the 3-arm phase III BCIRG 006 trial, which compared anthracycline/docetaxel (AC-T) with anthracycline/docetaxel and 1 year of trastuzumab (AC-TH) with docetaxel/carboplatin and 1 year of trastuzumab (TCH), demonstrated that AC-TH and TCH were associated with significantly greater disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The reported hazard ratios were 0.49 for AC-TH (P =.00000048) and 0.61 for TCH (P = .00015). There was no statistically significant difference in DFS between AC-TH and TCH. This study is the first to evaluate trastuzumab in combination with a nontaxane\u2013containing chemotherapy regimen in the adjuvant setting.\nThe trial randomized 3222 women, approximately 30% with node-negative disease. At 23 months of follow-up, there had been 322 events and 84 deaths. While the data are not yet mature enough to assess overall survival, there is sufficient follow-up to assess cardiac toxicity and genetic influences on efficacy.\nThere was an approximate 2-fold increase in grade 3/4 congestive heart failure (defined as decline in cardiac left ventricular function ), arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction among patients treated with AC-TH, according to Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD, of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California. \u201cThe interaction between and anthracycline seems to come to the fore here,\u201d he said. The results showed a 0.95% incidence of cardiotoxicity in the AC-T arm compared with a 2.34% incidence in the AC-TH arm (P = .016 vs AC-TH). In the TCH arm, the incidence of cardiotoxicity was 1.33% (P = .1 vs AC-TH). \u201cWith respect to ischemia and myocardial infarction, the events were balanced. The incidence of clinically meaningful arrhythmias was not significantly different among the 3 treatment arms, although 5 events remain to be adjudicated,\u201d Dr. Slamon said.\nImportantly, 9% of patients in the AC-T arm, 17.3% in the AC-TH arm, and 8% in the TCH group experienced a > 10% decrease in LVEF. These differences were highly statistically significant (P = .002 for AC-T vs AC-TH; P < .0001 for TCH vs AC-TH). \u201cThe mantra we\u2019ve all been told is that this is not a problem because patients get better. They recover quickly when they go off therapy,\u201d Dr. Slamon said. \u201cCertainly, their CHF gets better when they go on therapy, but that does not mean their heart disease is better,\u201d he said.\nConsequently, an analysis was done to evaluate the subclinical loss associated with declines in LVEF. The results for approximately 1000 patients per treatment arm showed a decrease in the mean for all patients. \u201cWith AC-T, we see a drop, and with AC-TH we see a significant drop, which does not return to baseline. This all revolves around an axis of approximately 4 points, which is taking all-comers\u201d Dr. Slamon said. \u201cSo, 17% of patients have lost 10% of their heart function and about 3% had CHF. This phenomenon is real, and it is not short-term, despite what we\u2019ve been told previously,\u201d he explained. LVEF declines are more sustained with AC-T and AC-TH (> 550 days at last follow-up) than was previously thought.\nAdditionally, results from mapping of the HER2 amplicon (N = 2120) show that coamplification of the topoisomerase II alpha gene occurred in approximately 35% of HER2-positive patients and may confer a therapeutic benefit with respect to anthracycline-based/trastuzumab combination regimens. \u201cMoreover, HER2-positive tumors that are not coamplified for topoisomerase II alpha\u2014approximately 65%\u2014do not appear to derive this same benefit and may be ideal candidates for nonanthracycline-containing, trastuzumab-based adjuvant regimens, thereby avoiding any potential cardiac toxicity,\u201d Dr. Slamon said.\nThe overall incidence of grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events was similar among the 3 treatment arms, with more neutropenia and leukopenia in the anthracycline-containing arms and more anemia and thrombocytopenia in the TCH arm. \u201cThis is likely due to the effect of carboplatin on platelets,\u201d Dr. Slamon said. Similarly, grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were well balanced among the 3 treatment arms.\nReageer op \"Herceptin - Trastuzumab in combinatie met anthracycline/docetaxel en of docetaxel - carboplatin geeft significant betere resultaten in ziektevrije periode bij borstkankerpati\u00ebnten met Her2-Neu positieve expressie, aldus fase III studie\"",

    "text": "Weeeellll\u2026..it\u2019s almost the end of January. How are you doing on your New Year\u2019s resolutions?\nThen Christmas happened. Woohoo. Let\u2019s add another five pounds!\nThe Christmas pounds are officially gone\u2013am now working on the hearty East European pounds. Then gonna work on five more \u2026.just cuz.\nI don\u2019t follow any specific plan. I try to make healthier choices, cut back on portions, cut out some of the bad stuff and just move more! It\u2019s amazing what little changes can do!\nHere\u2019s a fresh, flavorful and healthful way to help you keep your New Year\u2019s resolution to eat healthier\u2014Shrimp Pad Thai with Zucchini \u201cNoodles.\u201d This shrimp pad thai is full of fresh vegetables and lower in carbohydrates than traditional pad thai.\nPad thai is a dish that\u2019s common in Thai cuisine\u2014especially street food. It\u2019s made with rice noodles that are soaked in water, stir-fried, then combined with vegetables and proteins such as eggs, tofu, shrimp or chicken in a sweet-spicy sauce. Once you get all the ingredients prepped, shrimp pad thai comes together quickly making it perfect for a weeknight dinner.\nInstead of rice noodles, I use spiralized zucchini instead. Zucchini contains a fair amount of water you don\u2019t want diluting the vibrant flavors of this dish. After briefly stir-frying the zucchini, transfer to a sieve set over a bowl so some of the liquid drains out. (You want to be careful not to overcook the zucchini; it should still be slightly crunchy.) Cook the remaining ingredients, add the drained zucchini at the end and heat through.\nA question I receive frequently about fish sauce is what to substitute if a fish allergy exists. You can substitute soy sauce or make your own \u201cvegan\u201d fish sauce such as this recipe from The Kitchn.\nShrimp Pad Thai, a classic Thai street food gets an update with zucchini noodles!\nCombine first 7 ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet, saut\u00e9 pan or wok. Add the zucchini and cook 2-3 minutes or until beginning to soften slightly. Transfer to a sieve placed above a bowl and set aside.\nAdd 1/2 tablespoon oil to the pan, reduce heat to medium and add the eggs. Cook 1 minute or until set, stirring and breaking up the egg as you work. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\nHeat remaining oil over medium heat. Add red bell pepper and carrot. Cook 1 minute. Add the shrimp and cook 2 minutes per side or until cooked through and translucent.\nStir in the sauce. Bring to a simmer. Add scallions, zucchini and egg. Stir until heated through then add bean sprouts.\nServe immediately garnished with peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges.\nVery awesome. I love Pad Thai and cooking with shrimp and fish sauce. Thanks for the recipe and for sharing!\nThanks Elaine!! Hope you enjoy!",

    "text": "When I was in high school I used to watch the Carl Sagan series 'Cosmos', and was fascinated by how he used to bring physics to life. I even remember the episode where he describes the physical consequences of the natural constants being closer to real life (suppose the speed of light was 50 mph, etc).\nEver since then, I've looked for expositors who could extract the same kind of beauty out of mathematics and computer science, distilling its essence in a way that might seem obvious to those of us who practice it, but that allows the core concepts to be revealed to a non-technical audience in a way that captures the imagination.\nTimothy Gowers, the Fields Medalist, is well known for his expository articles on a variety of topics. He gave a speech in 2000 in Paris at an event sponsored by the Clay Mathematics Institute. The speech was titled 'The Importance of Mathematics', and I highly encourage watching it.\nWhat struck me the most about this lecture was his eloquent defense of mathematics, and how he conveyed a sense of the aesthetic beauty of the field (why mathematicians refer to a theorem as 'beautiful'). With beautiful examples, he systematically laid out the landscape of a mathematical life, not in terms of topics, but in terms of how mathematical work is done.\n(2) A typical mathematician does not try to be useful.\narguing that (1) is false even though (2) is usually true, and that it should be this way.\nMathematics is surprisingly useful, because complexity arises from simplicity and beauty reveals itself to be important.\nI just bought his book 'Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction', which brings out these ideas in much more detail, and also puts to rest some of the usual canards associated with mathematics (the 30yr old rule, the lack of women, etc).\nTo some degree, the description of the daily activities of an algorithms researcher are similar to that of a mathematician, but in many ways they are different. We need a similar exposition for theoryCS !",

My grandfather\u2019s photographs had come from the trunk that lay smashed sooner than me. I wasn\u2019t convinced, although, until eventually i discovered an image of the freaks: masked ruffle-collared young children who feeding one another a coil of ribbon. I didn\u2019t recognize what they have been alleged to be, exactly\u2014besides gas for nightmares; what have been they, sadomasochistic ballerinas? \u2014but there has been doubtless in my brain that Grandpa Portman had an image of those similar boys. I\u2019d visible it in his cigar field quite a few months in the past.\nIt used to be darkish now, however the breeze had died and one way or the other the air appeared warmer than it had all day. I picked up the flashlight and stepped towards the timber. My grandfather used to be in the market someplace, i used to be convinced of it. yet the place? i used to be no tracker, and neither was once Ricky. And but anything looked as if it would advisor me anyway\u2014a quickening within the chest; a whisper within the viscous air\u2014and by surprise I couldn\u2019t wait one other moment. I tromped into the underbrush like a bloodhound scenting an invisible path. It\u2019s not easy to run in a Florida woods, the place each sq. foot now not occupied by way of timber is bristling with thigh-high palmetto spears and nets of entangling skunk vine, yet I did my most sensible, calling my grandfather\u2019s identify and sweeping my flashlight in all places.\nNo matter what. \u201d I hung up and known as my good friend Ricky for a journey. Ten mins later I heard the unmistakable throaty honk of his old Crown Victoria within the car parking zone. On my means out I broke the undesirable information to Shelley: her tower of Stay-Tite must wait till the following day. \u201cFamily emergency,\u201d I defined. \u201cRight,\u201d she acknowledged. I emerged into the sticky-hot night to discover Ricky smoking at the hood of his battered motor vehicle. whatever approximately his mud-encrusted boots and how he enable smoke curl from his lips and the way the sinking sunlight lit his eco-friendly hair jogged my memory of a punk, redneck James Dean.\nThen the wild-haired lady took the level. Her identify used to be Fiona, Emma stated. She stood dealing with the group in the back of a planter full of airborne dirt and dust, her arms raised above it like a conductor. The orchestra started to play \u201cFlight of the Bumblebee\u201d (as good as they can, anyway), and Fiona pawed the air above the planter, her face contorted in attempt and focus. because the tune crescendoed, a row of daisies poked up from the dust and unfurled towards her fingers. It used to be like a type of fast-motion movies of crops blooming, other than she appeared to be reeling the flora up from their loamy mattress through invisible strings.\nYet no matter what it really is, she\u2019d greater hurry. \u201d I appeared right down to see what Bronwyn used to be doing yet as a substitute stuck a glimpse of Millard at the ladder under us, surrounded through curious flashlight fish. Then I felt the hull vibrate opposed to my ft, and a second later Bronwyn surfaced maintaining an oblong piece of steel approximately six ft by means of 4, with a riveted around gap within the best. She had wrenched the shipment hold\u2019s door from its hinges. \u201cAnd what are you going to do with that? \u201d Emma stated. \u201cGo to the lighthouse,\u201d she answered.",

    "text": "Build in 'Cartesian Style CNC' published by JWhitten, Nov 21, 2014.\nMy kids and I built this OX CNC Router for use in our various projects. We had a blast building it, it was a lot of fun.\nWe pretty much followed Mark Carew's build video and the result is what you see. It took us essentially two weekends to get it all put together, but there were some last minute changes in the selection of electronics and motors which made it stretch out a little longer while we waited for them to arrive.\nOur version of the OX uses the Autek 5-Axis Breakout Board and Stepper Motor Drivers available on Ebay. The motors were also New-Old Stock surplus from Ebay. The physical frame is made from V-Slot Aluminum extrusions and measures 1,500 mm long (Y-Axis) by 1,000 mm wide (X-Axis) by around 300 mm tall (Z-Axis). I haven't measured the height exactly, but the lead screw itself is 300 mm. I'm currently using an el-cheapo ($29 bucks) one-speed (too fast) spindle head from Harbor Freight. But I've just purchased a new Bosch 1617EVS 2-1/4 HP Variable-Speed Router (from Amazon) and a set of mounting plates from Chris Laidlaw (ChrisClub1 on Ebay). I also got the X-Plate, Motor Mounts and Gantry Sides from Chris. You can see he does fine work and I recommend him highly! He's a great guy, very nice.\nOur build was inspired by Mark Carew's OX CNC Router - Thanks MARK !! Also need to give a shout out to Chris Laidlaw (ChrisClub on Ebay) who made the excellent Gantry Sides, Motor Mounts, and other key hardware components! Thanks CHRIS!!",

    "text": "Yamacutah is a sacred Native American Shrine located along North Oconee River in Jackson, County, Georgia.\nIt was there that the Indians believed the Great Spirit once walked.\nLocal historian Gustavus James Wilson, who wrote of the shrine in his book \u201cThe Early History of Jackson County,\u201d was one of the only documents of the story of Yamacutah. Wilson, 1827-1909, lived in Jefferson at the time of when he wrote of its history.\nThe site was protected by the Creek Indians until 1785, when \u201ca treaty was signed\u201d which ceded the lands to the white settlers.\nIn the book, Wilson wrote of two men who traveled from Virginia to Georgia in 1784. The explorers were Jordan Clark and Jacob Bankston who had heard of Yamacutah from a group of Choctaw Indians in Wilkes County, and upon searching for the shrine, they found it on April 22, 1784, according to the history.\nWhat the explorers had described was a statue set atop an earthen mound about 6 feet high plus 17 feet in circumference.\nThe statue\u2019s head \u201cwas well formed. The neck was unduly long and slender. The chin and forehead were retreating. They eyes were finely executed, and looked anxiously to the east\u2026 Four smooth paths led in four directions from the statue\u2026And here, amid those gloomy solitudes the natives believed that our God, their Great Spirit, had walked as a man walks along his homeward pathway,\u201d is what Smith had wrote.\nThe mound, in the center of a circular landscape that measured at 150 yards in diameter, had other rock monuments carved with designs such as moons and the sun, too.\nSurrounding the holy grounds were the giant hardwoods and pines of a virgin forest.\nRichard Thornton, an architect and city planner from Dahlonega, who has personally searched the forests of Jackson County for Yamacutah, stated, \u201cIt is not a myth,\u201d in a recent interview. Thornton, who is also Creek Indian, said he once considered Yamacutah a myth.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know the name Yamacutah. I just knew there was some mystical place where God came down to earth. I thought it was some tall story from my grandmother,\u201d said Thornton, who himself has studied Native American history and was an architect for a Trail of Tears memorial in Oklahoma.\nWilson\u2019s book also records that in 1785 there was a bitterly cold winter in which wildlife froze to death and a day of darkness in which the sun, while visible, gave no light as it appeared hidden by a fog.\nInterestingly enough, these conditions actually happened due to volcano eruptions in Iceland at the time.\nResearchers like Thornton, continue to try to solve this mystery.",

    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Nov 2018 (IPS) \u2013 Only 18 percent of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean live in rural areas, but these are increasingly hotbeds of poverty, and climate change is playing a major role in this phenomenon.\nStories of extreme drought followed by flash floods that virtually destroy entire crops and wreak chaos abounded during the region\u2019s first Week of Agriculture and Food, held Nov. 20-23 in the Argentine capital.\nThe more than 1,000 officials, experts and civil society representatives who participated in the meeting agreed that the fall in agricultural yields and migration from the countryside are visible consequences of global warming.\n\u201cThis year we had a lengthy drought that destroyed about 80 percent of the basic grains of subsistence farmers, and two months later we saw tremendous flooding that affected 23,000 hectares in the south of the country,\u201d Honduran deputy agriculture minister Jos\u00e9 Alberto Ben\u00edtez told IPS.\n\u201cWe are the country most affected by climate change in the world. And when we see that thousands of young Hondurans have started migration caravans to Mexico or the United States, it\u2019s largely because it\u2019s increasingly difficult for them to stay in rural areas,\u201d he added.\nThere are 59 million poor people in the countryside, according to the Panorama of Rural Poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was presented during the Week of Agriculture and Food by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which organised the event together with the Argentine government.\nThis figure marks a historic setback, because between 1990 and 2014 rural poverty in the region had fallen from 65 percent to 46 percent.\nHowever, from 2014 to 2016 it increased more than two percentage points and today it affects 48.6 percent of the rural population. Of that proportion, 22.5 percent live in extreme poverty.\n\u201cIn the south, Argentina had the worst drought in 50 years this year, after crops had been lost to flooding the previous year. And in the Caribbean, Dominica\u2019s entire agricultural crop disappeared from the map in 2017 because of devastating hurricanes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe need international funding, but official, government-to-government aid is not sufficient. We need a lot of private investment, in renewable energy, in new forms of infrastructure or in resilient agricultural systems,\u201d said Berdegu\u00e9.\nFAO\u2019s Panorama of Rural Poverty reveals that rural workers in Latin America earn less than half of what urban workers earn. The average income of the former, in 2015, was 363 dollars a year, compared to 804 dollars for those working in towns and cities.\nThe result is that many flee the hardship of rural life. In Honduras, 76 percent of those who leave their places of origin leave behind rural municipalities. And the proportion stands at 70 percent in El Salvador and 61 percent in Guatemala.\nLina Pohl, El Salvador\u2019s environment and natural resources minister, warned that if ways are not found to increase agricultural yields, the future will bring higher prices, more hunger and social upheaval.\nIn that sense, she said that \u201ceach country must find its own path, because technology transfer has not been successful, and there is no agenda for joint, integrated work,\u201d despite the resources that the international community allocates to the issue of climate change.\nEl Salvador, he said, has been hit hard, since \u201call the groundwater monitoring networks show a tendency towards a reduction,\u201d and global warming makes water even more necessary.\n\u201cThe best future scenario, of a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, will mean that maize crop productivity in El Salvador will fall 30 percent over the next 15 years,\u201d he said.\nIn a world where the agricultural agenda is increasingly overlapping with the environmental agenda, the sector is also singled out for the generation of greenhouse gases.\nAccording to FAO\u2019s data, 61 percent of the 33 countries in the region pledged at the United Nations to reduce agricultural emissions, in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, reached in December 2015.\n\u201cMany of the measurements linked to climate change are taken with indicators that we have not generated ourselves. This means they do not take into account situations in which, far from emitting, we are actually sequestering carbon,\u201d he told IPS.\nThe Buenos Aires meeting came at a particularly dramatic time for the region: in the last three years, the number of hungry people has increased.\nThere are 39 million hungry people, despite the fact that, according to FAO, Latin America and the Caribbean produce enough food not only for the region\u2019s 646 million inhabitants but also for 169 million more.\nIn addition, 294 million people (46 per cent of the population) suffer from some form of malnutrition.\nThe extraordinary movement of resources generated by climate change could also be an opportunity for the region, according to Deissy Mart\u00ednez Bar\u00f3n, coordinator of the Center for Research on Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), an institution based in Cali, Colombia.\n\u201cSince the 1990s there has been a downward trend in the participation of the agricultural sector in the economies of the countries of the region. This could be due to climate change,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cIn order to do this, it is essential to build sustainable agriculture adapted to the climate. If we do nothing, there are 36 million people in the region whose food security is at risk due to loss of agricultural yields. But climate change can give us the financing we need,\u201d she concluded.",

    "text": "Last week, the Oregon chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses was pleased to have Angie Millan MSN, RN (President Elect NAHN National Organization 2010-2012 and current President, NAHN-Los Angeles Chapter) as an honored guest at their monthly meeting. OR Chapter President Maria Elena Ruiz PhD, RN, FNP-BC began with an inspiring presentation, \"Listening to the Voices of Latino Nurses in Oregon: Findings from the Leadership Development Workshops-Latino Nurses in Oregon Speak Out\". It was clear from Dr. Ruiz's findings that Oregon Latino nurses are committed to uniting and providing the necessary support, role modeling, and mentoring necessary to empower each other, in addition to lending a voice for Latino issues.\nA good portion of the meeting was spent on discussion of health promotion events geared toward the Latino population in Oregon and Los Angeles, CA. Ms. Millan shared that the upcoming annual nursing conference planned in LA would include speakers from the March of Dimes to help educate nurses about what services are available that would be beneficial to children and families they are caring for. The IX Annual Bi-national Health Week taking place October 2-15, 2009, a large scale multi-national health campaign targeted at the Latino community to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits, was also discussed. The goal is to bring awareness and focus to some of the most critical health issues and health disparities that have a significant impact on this under-served group.\nThe National Association of Hispanic Nurses endorsed the Office of the National Nurse initiative earlier this year. The Board of Directors of the National Nursing Network Organization is honored to have their support. Here is a statement from the letter received from President Norma Martinez Rogers Rogers PhD, RN, FAAN, \"The National Nurse would provide a visible nurse leader to advocate for enhanced prevention efforts for all communities. Further, we recognize the potential of having a National Nurse who would be able to meet with health care leaders to highlight health disparities and bring forward new ideas.\"\nThe National Nursing Network Organization would like to answer some questions we have heard in regards to the Office of the National Nurse initiative . Please also visit our Frequently Asked Questions for more information about the proposal.\nHow would having a National Nurse actually help nurses become volunteers for prevention in their own communities?\nThis is a very important question, because engaging trusted healthcare providers will help shift our nation to initiate and value prevention. The answers may lie in the value of having a highly visible and trusted public figure leading prevention, a National Nurse, who will publicly encourage, acknowledge and reward volunteer contributions. The National Nurse will not only guide prevention and suggest focus campaigns, but will evaluate outcomes and publicly recognize successful programs and deserving volunteers.\nWe know shortages already exist in many health occupations, so is it realistic to think there will be a pool of volunteers?\nEach healthcare provider will determine if, how and when they are able to participate. Nurses, no matter how busy, are nurturing altruistic persons. Nurses often step up to the plate when needed, as evidenced in disasters. Continued invitations from the Office of the National Nurse to seek nurse volunteers will result in more engagement for prevention. Also, the National Nurse will encourage the involvement of recent retirees and students, which will boost the potential pool of volunteer manpower in every community. Students will benefit from varied opportunities for learning, observations and hands-on experiences during community outreach efforts. Retirees can make significant contributions and will be able to remain professionally active, utilize their vast knowledge of resources, and receive continuing education to maintain active licensure. In some community prevention programs, modest stipends might be provided through grant funding to participating providers.\nWhat kinds of activities will a National Nurse encourage volunteers to do?\nNurses and other providers can contribute to their community prevention programs in many ways. Often they can join existing networks to strengthen effective programs specifically targeted to at-risk populations. They can strengthen education and outreach of established national associations such as the American Red Cross or the American Heart and Diabetes Associations. Some may prefer to work directly where needed with the local schools and colleges attended by their children. Others may become active volunteers for their health department or a Medical Reserve Corps unit. Others may choose to become politically active at the policy level to improve health and environmental conditions in their community. Others may serve on the Board of a local community based organization, or participate in organizing screening programs or community health fair events. As the Office of the National Nurse accumulates data on best practices, the information will be relayed to encourage replication of effective programs.\nU Penn graduate nursing students Melissa Moore BSN, RN; Grace Paik BSN, RN, and Timothy Sowicz BSN, RN chose to complete a poster presentation on the Office of the National Nurse initiative for their health policy project. In addition, Moore, Paik and Sowicz also wrote an op/ed, \"Can One Nurse Empower a Profession\"; they contacted their state legislators; and they attended a Lobby Day meeting with representatives from the PA Coalition of Nurse Practitioners and the PA State Nurses Association. The PA Coalition of Nurse Practitioners endorsed the Office of the National Nurse initiative earlier this summer.\nTimothy Sowicz shares, \"This year long legislative project that my classmates and I worked on to promote the Office of the National Nurse has given me insight into the need for the shift that must occur in our health care system: Disease prevention and health promotion must be the priority for every provider! A National Nurse is the ideal person to lead this initiative since these two principles are fundamental to the profession of nursing.\"\nThese students join their peers from universities and colleges around the country who have studied the ONN initiative. This list includes but is not limited to UC Irvine, University of Michigan, University of San Francisco, Concordia University (Portland, OR), George Mason University, Portland Community College, Molloy College (NY), Mt Wachusett Community College (Gardiner, MA), CA State University Long Beach (CA), and OR Health Sciences University.\nLast week the Portland Community College chapter of the National Student Nurses Association, demonstrating their dedication and support for an Office of the National Nurse, led a healthy heart promotion activity with 23 elementary school children ranging from 5-9 years old who were attending a summer camp in a local park. The students chose the heart to focus on because starting healthy habits during childhood can help to prevent heart disease as an adult.\n1. A demonstration of the HEART pumping BLOOD to the LUNGS to pick up OXYGEN to be delivered to the body. The students drew large pictures on poster board or cardboard of the HEART, BLOOD CELL, LUNGS, O2, and then had the children act out those: the \"blood cell\" walked from the \"heart\" to the \"lungs\" and picked up an \"O2\" who then delivered the \"O2\" to the body and go back to the \"heart\".\n2. Circulation demonstration: Here the kids identified what activities make the heart pump stronger (i.e. playing XBOX or riding a bike...etc.). The children were taught how to take their pulse, then the students had them get up and dance with the assistance of music through a PA system. They took their pulse immediately after this activity and reported what happened to their pulse! The student nurses then demonstrated how a blood pressure is taken.\n3. The third booth helped the kids to identify foods that are Heart Smart: Here a discussion took place on how/why some foods are bad for heart and some foods are good. Then the kids played a \"What's better game.....\"\nA. French Fries? or B. Apples?\nPictures of foods were held up and the kids shouted out which one is better. Every child who participated received a copy of this handout along with a goodie bag that included age appropriate materials from the American Heart Association.\nFew can rival Governor Howard Dean (VT) when it comes to achieving meaningful health reform. During his tenure as Governor of Vermont, he oversaw the expansion of Dr. Dynasaur, a program in Vermont that makes universal health care available for children and pregnant women in the state. The program resulted in the uninsured rate in Vermont dropping to 9.6%, half the national average and helped reduce rates of child abuse and teen pregnancy by 50%.\nSince his return to the private sector, Governor Dean has remained committed to establishing quality, affordable and accessible health care for all Americans. Governor Dean has authored a book, Howard Dean\u2019s Prescription for Real Healthcare Reform. Dean states, \u201cAmerica must shift from an illness-based healthcare system to a wellness-based model. We must develop a healthcare system that is based on wellness and prevention rather than illness intervention.\u201d These statements are in synch with the Office of the National Nurse initiative.\nThe Vice-President of the National Nursing Network Organization, Terri Polick RN, interviewed Governor Dean last week.\nPreventive healthcare is a key component in the healthcare reform debate. What are your thoughts on a proposal that would make the Chief Nurse Officer of the United States Public Health Service the National Nurse? In your opinion, would establishing the Office of the National Nurse have any impact on health promotion or on healthcare reform?\nGovernor Dean joins over 75 prominent national and state organizations and leaders who have endorsed the Office of the National Nurse initiative and we thank him for his support.",

    "text": "If you want to start saving money quickly the first thing you need to do is set yourself a goal; whether it is buying a house, getting the kitchen done or paying for a wedding, having a reason to save money fast will motivate you and keep you focused on reaching that dream. Once you have your goal, use the tips below and see your piggy bank grow, quickly.\nTake a look at the things that you are currently paying for, and make a list of the essential payments such as your rent/mortgage, household bills, mobile phone, transport, insurance and food. Then, calculate how much money you spend on each on a monthly basis. These are your regular expenses.\nWhen your list is complete, identify the regular expenses which you could potentially save money on by making some adjustments; for example, cooking at home instead of ordering takeaway or switching energy suppliers.\nOnce you\u2019re done trimming your regular expenses, take a look at your irregular expenses and give yourself a monthly budget for all of them; this will help you assess every month what you can afford doing and what can wait until the next pay check. Irregular expenses include entertainment, leisure activities, grooming and clothing.\nSaving money is a little bit like going on a diet; in order to succeed, you need to change your habits and get into a routine. To make this easier, pick a day of the week when you are most likely to have 5 minutes to spare. For example, if you tend to get into work early on Mondays or if you usually have lunch at your desk on Wednesdays, make it a habit to log into your bank account and quickly check your finances.\nBy monitoring your spending on a weekly basis, you will be able to assess how much money you have left and reduce the risk of going into your overdraft.\nHaving a list of dates when your direct debits (not currently available, but it\u2019s coming soon!) are due is also a good idea; that way you will know how much money is actually yours to spend and how much is part of your regular expenses.\nWhen comparing prices between normal and LED light bulbs, the latter might not seem like the most suitable choice if you\u2019re trying to save money. But, in the long run you\u2019ll be better off.\nLED light bulbs might be considerably more expensive than traditional ones, but they are 10 times more efficient at converting electricity into light and they also last longer. Research done by Comparethemarket.com has shown that investing in making the switch can save you up to \u00a3240 per year, and pay for themselves within five months of installation. Making the switch is an easy way to save money, and make your home more efficient at the same time.\nBefore heading to the shop, write down a list of the things that you need to buy; if you are going to a familiar supermarket draw yourself a route based on the shop\u2019s aisles and list each item in order according to your route; this will help you stay focused on the things that you need and avoid temptations.\nIt is known that supermarkets place items on shelves strategically; you will usually find the most famous brands and items that have a higher price on the mid-shelves or at eye level. Cheaper items of the same kind or reduced items tend to be on the bottom shelves.\nIf you ever get some coupons/vouchers through the post or find some online, keep them in your purse/wallet so you have them on you whenever you visit a shop.\nLast but not least, never visit a supermarket on an empty stomach. Shopping whilst you are hungry will only make you crave food more, and you\u2019ll end up buying half the store.\nChanging your cooking and eating habits can help you save money rather quickly. Start off by using everything you have bought throughout the week, and make an effort to not throw food away. If you have a recipe that requires only half an onion, half a pepper and half a broccoli, why not make double the amount and keep what you don\u2019t need in the freezer, or pack it for lunch the next day?\nMaking packed lunches is another way to save big money almost instantly. The average amount spent on lunch during the week is \u00a36 per day, that is \u00a330 per week and \u00a3120 per month, whereas buying ingredients to make sandwiches or salads for a whole week costs about \u00a310.\nIt\u2019s the little changes that make a big difference when you need to save money fast.

    "text": "When JRPGs were struggling to evolve last generation, Xenoblade Chronicles came along and showed the genre still had a few tricks up its sleeve. It earned plenty of praise as one of the best role-playing games of last generation, currently holding a 92 score on Metacritic. Monolith Soft proved it could create a compelling world and innovate in the genre, thanks to its creative design and MMO-style combat.\nIts successor, Xenoblade Chronicles X, doesn't just switch it up to an extensive sci-fi setting; it expands the scope of everything, building upon the solid foundation set by its predecessor. I recently spent five hours with the game, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. If you thought Xenoblade Chronicles was big, you will be surprised just how much Xenoblade Chronicles X dwarfs it - and that's not even mentioning the extensive customization or Skells (mechs) that further enhance the experience.\nNot much has been revealed about X's plot, except that a huge battle between two alien species above Earth has destroyed our home planet. Humans evacuated and have spent the past two years roaming space in emergency ships. However, the real story doesn't begin until your main character (you can customize your gender and appearance), crash lands on the planet of Mira. Without much memory of who you are, you're greeted by a woman named Elma, who shows you the ropes of life on this -mysterious continent called Primordia. A rocky grasslands region, Primordia is the first of five different continents that make up Mira.\nElma explains that when their ship, the White Whale, crashed here two months ago, the surviving humans began slowly building New Los Angeles. A good portion of Xenoblade Chronicles' plotline focuses on rebuilding society and finding survivors to revive humanity, but what's most intriguing are the mysteries Mira holds. The planet is teeming with dangers beyond enormous creatures; in fact, as you explore, you run into various alien species. Some will be hostile; others will join your base if you help them out. Can everyone coexist? This already seems more exciting than Xenoblade Chronicles' plot. We always question if there's life on other planets and if it would be friendly or not, and I like how X explores this concept.\nAlso noticeable right out of the gate is that X's dialogue has much more personality than Xenoblade Chronicles. Your dialogue choices elicit different responses depending on what you pick. These won't alter the storyline, but instead color the conversations you have with other characters. At one point, I try to take credit for keeping the area safe, and Elma quickly calls me on it. Later, we meet our second party member, Lin Lee, a 15-year-old mechanic. She's extremely gifted, but every so often says something that reminds you she's just 15, like when she talks about her Skell fan-fiction. The humor isn't overdone and is clever when it's used. Counting Elma and Lin Lee, a total of 16 characters can be recruited for your party. This includes all the DLC characters released in Japan; Nintendo is including them at no cost in the North American release.\nBecoming A Member Of B.L.A.D.E.\nThe opening moments serve to ease you into the mechanics and all the different things you can do. It's a lot of information to take in, and even after spending five hours with the game, I was still learning the ropes. New Los Angeles, with its four districts, serves as your hub. After a few basic missions, you join up with B.L.A.D.E. (Builders of a Legacy After the Destruction of Earth). This group was created to maintain the burgeoning New Los Angeles and to explore for supplies and threats. Once you join, you get to pick from one of eight different classes, from mediators who help the townspeople to reclaimers who search for wreckage from the White Whale. Every class comes with its own perks, and just because you pick a class doesn't mean you can't do activities associated with others; this just gives you an area to focus on for potential upgrades for your character. Throughout the game, you earn division points for defeating enemies, completing missions, and opening chests. Bonus division points are awarded if you do missions in your specialization. Division points allow you to level up your B.L.A.D.E. rank, which grants you additional rewards and higher level probes.\nB.L.A.D.E. has its own mission board, where you can retrieve different job requests. From the get-go, the board is overflowing with a variety of missions, on top of people handing you tasks. More than 400 quests exist, including story missions that advance the plot, affinity missions that improve your relationship with characters, and normal side quests such as rescuing characters or retrieving items. The narrative has a total of 12 chapters, but you can't advance unless you meet certain requirements. For instance, you might need to reach a specific affinity level with a character or explore 15 percent of the continent to proceed.\nA variety of activities are available in Xenoblade X's vast open world, and they fit seamlessly into the overall exploration, such as placing probes (which also opens fast travel to those locations) and helping characters in peril. Who knows? Maybe you'll run into members of a new species and convince them to join up with you. At one point, I recruited a species and I was given access to brand-new weaponry.\nOne side quest tasked me with obtaining a red orb that was inconveniently placed in front of two level 35 tyrants. I was level five at the time, so there was no way I could afford to draw their attention my way, forcing me to slowly walk by them and figure out a way to stay out of their sight.\nVarious chests and places to mine resources are uncovered as you explore. You must tap \"A\" repeatedly to open these, but some chests remain locked until you level up this ability. Returning from Xenoblade are orbs littered on the field, which contain additional items. The jump button allows you to get up on higher ledges, but if you use it while running you can do a super jump that lets you float through the air. This quickly became my favorite way to explore.\nAll sorts of creatures inhabit the land, be they aggressive, neutral, or friendly. Paying attention to the color above them is essential; if it's red, you need to keep your awareness up. The joy of the game really stems from exploration; majestic, dinosaur-like creatures are all around. Other continents sport completely different looks. For instance, one is a jungle and contains alligators that leap out from the water to attack you. Another is a fire island that rains fire and allows you to explore inside volcanoes.\nEach locale is filled with nooks and crannies, but quests leave a marker for you to track down. Better yet, after a few missions, you unlock the \"follow ball.\" All you need to do is hold \"R\" and press \"X,\" and a navigational ball leads you to your destination. This comes in handy when there are mountains or other obstacles in your way, showing you a fast path to get around them.\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, Xenoblade Chronicles X has two different online features. You can recruit other player-created character NPCs, who can then be used in your party. You also build affinity with these NPC rentals on the battlefield. However, the more exciting online feature is the ability to join squads. Squads hold 32 players and allow you to participate in squad quests, which let you team up with three other players to take on tougher content, such as the gigantic, super-powerful tyrants.\nBefore you can unlock squad quests, however, you must first complete squad missions. These special objectives need to be completed in a certain amount of time. All squad members see the list and once a member completes something on it, it gets marked as completed in the other squad members\u2019 games. This allows you to divvy up tasks as you see fit. You can also exchange loot with your squad, so if you get gear or weapons that don\u2019t suit your playstyle, you can let your friend reap the benefits.\nXenoblade Chronicles X's battle system doesn't change significantly from its predecessor. You activate skills on a cooldown meter while your character automatically uses regular attacks, akin to an MMORPG. But the battles are noticeably faster and smoother than before, something Monolith executive director Tetsuya Takahashi said was born out of this game having longer conflicts. \"[We] wanted the pace of the combat to be faster, so those don't last too long,\" he says.\nI took delight in finding the right grooves of attacks to create deadly combos. Positioning still matters greatly, and every art has a positioning bonus. For instance, an art bonus can provide a damage increase for a side attack, or a specific art may add a 50-percent damage bonus if the enemy is toppled. You can combine these for devastating combos.\nAdditionally, I enjoyed being able to alternate between melee and ranged attacks. My character had a deadly sword I could use up close, but if I wanted to play it safer, I could always swap to my gun and snipe from afar. I actually preferred the guns to the sword for this reason - and let's be honest, lasers are just cooler. The A.I. is also much better this time around; my allies rarely died and knew when to fall back and heal.\nArts can be customized to fit your playstyle. For the start of the game, you are a drifter that allows you to obtain a variety of different arts. Once you reach level 10, you have different branches you can break off into: enforcer, striker, and guerrilla. Enforcers support from afar, gaining access to a slew of ranged arts. Guerillas are like tanks who want to rack up damage; their arts are focused on damage buffs, evasion, and improved accuracy. Strikers go in guns blazing and are a mix of offensive and defensive skills, providing HP and melee power bonuses. The striker is the recommended class for beginners, while the enforcer is for more experienced players.\nThose expecting to hop right into a mech might be disappointed; you don't get your Skell license until chapter six, halfway through the game. You also won't receive your first Skell until level 20, and you can't pilot it until researching the flight pack after chapter nine. \"The main reason we didn't want players to have the Skell from the beginning of the game is that we wanted them to have the opportunity to fully explore the world on foot first,\" Takahashi says. \"The world starts to feel quite a bit different once you have the Skell, especially once you experience different layers of the world vertically.\"\nNintendo skipped me ahead so I could test one out. Skells definitely make exploration a different beast; you can fly to floating islands and some structures have hidden caves that can only be accessed via flight. Skells also make journeying between continents much easier - I didn't even care about fast travel once I got mine.\nStepping into X is overwhelming for its sheer vastness and scope alone, but that's what makes it so thrilling. The game feels endless, but my desire to keep on playing and discovering new things never left me. My early look has me confident that this game will inspire massive playthroughs just like its predecessor, but X feels like it has even more to offer in terms of variety and size. Plus, who isn't excited to see Takahashi and company get back to their sci-fi roots \u00e0 la Xenogears and Xenosaga?\nXenoblade Chronicles X also has plenty of late-game content to make your Skell worthwhile. It features numerous post-game monsters, like a level 99 baddie soaring in the sky, and online play makes it possible to take down deadly foes with friends. In addition, hidden dungeons, higher-level mechs, and powerful gear and weapons provide extra incentive to keep exploring. \u201cOne figure we\u2019re hearing from people [in Japan] is that they\u2019ve spent two to three times the amount of hours they spent on clearing the main story on end-game content,\u201d says Monolith Soft executive director Tetsuya Takahashi.",

I've been interested in Black Crusade for quite a while now, and own the book(a GenCon Pre-Release ), so I was wondering if the spot for the CSM Champion was taken yet. I thought I'd ask before setting up a character background/concept, on the off chance that it was and I simply missed it.\nSend your concept through to the GM, he'll pick the group.\nThe heretek will come into play just a while after the heretics meet the CSM and will indeed be from off planet. I have two concepts competing for the heretek position, so I'll have a fun time choosing.\nSo far I have not received any concepts for the Champion, you are welcome to contribute.\nAs for Mein Fuhrer, no way I am letting a starting character have a Daemon Weapon. Especially with that name, my gramps would be spinning in his coffin, gevalt geshreeyeh!\nThe weapon fairly specifically isn't a demon weapon, but rather a frozen shard taken with the Cursed Heirloom talent. I'd certainly be happy to pick another name for it, of course, but it's basically a REALLY unlucky dagger that has the ability to kill space marines.\nThe weapon fairly specifically isn't a demon weapon, but rather a frozen shard taken with the Cursed Heirloom talent.\nThis^, I had the same 'wtf daemon weapon?!' moment when i first read it, but i looked it up in the book and its actually a exotic melee weapon, so its a valid choice as far as i know.\nIt steps on the same thematic territory as a daemon weapon, but doesn't have the mechanical power of one, and almost certainly isn't sentient. My character concept likely would be caught talking to it, but it's really an inanimate object that gets treated like a person. The item is supposed to be a plot hook, though, since it can cause trouble with its origins, curse, and stubborn unwillingness to be seperated from its owner.\nJoking aside I'm feeling kinda overwhelmed making a sorcerer for the first time, not to mention being used to playing Imperial Guard, I kinda look at chaos's interpertaions of the lore in the book and thinking \"dear merciful god... these guys have their heads even farther up their asses than the Imperial Cult, and THAT is saying somthing!\"\nI'm kinda feeling sorry for the civs, trapped between a ruthless parinoid theocratic regime and the insane bloodcrazed anarchists who want to bring it down.\nStill I am completely rewriting the backstory and I find some of the images hard to look at in the book, the only creatures that don't look so messed up they make me want to shove a chainsword through them are in fact the CSM sorcerers, and perhaps a few cool looking mutants.\nseeing an actual character sheet helps me put things togeather too.\nI'm thinking about what darkling said about going a marine going rouge, funny thing is, dispite seeing all the horrors of the imperial machine. I can't bring myself to hate the emperor himself even in game.\nthe idea was this marine peicing even some of this togeather, imagine what that would do to such a man.\nThe chapter I liked the most for this future character is the Celestrial Lions, they tried going through the proper channels to demand an investigation into the unsessary inquisitorial glassing of a planet they'd protected. for their trouble, they never got an answer as the inquisition anserws to nobody, their high command on the way to petition the emperor himself was \"accidently\" blown off course into an ork infested region, and the rest of the chapter was dispatched to armageddion to protect a hive city, a good portion of the chapter was killed on that meatgrinder world, they aren't gone but I'm guessing they are seriously bitter at the inquisition, even if they can't prove anything.\nNothing elaborate, we can generate plot hooks as we go. I like to start broad and then work in the details as they arise.\nDauskin was one of the people that grew up among the Crom Tribe. A forgotten human world that degenerated into primal survival, where the Gods and the Emporer of Man were nothing more than story tales. As a youth he had a knack for tinkering with tools and weapons. Lostech from ages past were sometimes dug up and he would pry them apart to find out what made them tick. Sometimes he made genuine improvements, but most of the time, it ended in failure or sharp explosion. Others discredited him as a fool for wasting so much energy on trinkets when harvests and supplies for the lean months were paramount.\nHe wasn\u2019t a strong youth like many of the others, but his quick wit and ruthless tactics at least left him an able fighter of the village. Again the tribe berrated him for trying to hide and attacking a foe, unseen. There was no honor in fighting dirty. \u201cWhat good is honor to the dead?\u201d He would reply.\nIn truth, Dauskin was tired of conforming to the daily drudgery and meager survival of living to another day. When the Old Hag mentioned power and prophecy, he lept at the chance to be free of the lesser minded tribesman.\nSo now here he was, with a few others from the tribe. He didn\u2019t believe they would find whatever it was they were looking for. If anything, they\u2019d come back after a few days, but maybe Dauskin would find a suitable place to set up and break away from the tribe.\nAdroit: Pick a Characteristic. For the rest of the game, that characteristc scores an additional success on any test it is involved in.\nThe Frozen Shard is Extremely rare while the Cursed Heirloom only permits Very Rare or less.\nEveryone seems to be fully stating their characters out instead of just giving concepts... should i do the same?\nI will not look over any stats until I have decided which concepts will be picked. Which I will do in approximately eight hours. If one have not posted a concept until then I must sadly reject further concepts in lieu of planning the encounters and adventure.\nTo those that is in the panic of coming up and writing their concept, take it easy, you got plenty of hours before I start checking in, no need to rush.\nokay here's the concept for Avarius Leonin, former loyalist marine of the Celestrial Lions he supposedly only had minor psychic potental, enough to denote him for further conditioning in loyality to the chapter and the emperor, and get him the marine equilivent of a desk position as protector and cataloger of relics. He was simply a low ranking libarian. He was content with helping his brothers off and a few times on the battlefield, and training the beings and powers of chaos held no lure over him.\nThat innocence and contentment changed when the Celestrial lions began questioning the inquisition's brutality against civilans they'd saved Albiet through offical channels, even going so far as to try and petition the emperor. the death of their entire command staff due to a \"Freak Warp Storm\" 80% of the chapter being ground into sausage, and loosing their gene-seeds thanks to suprisingly intelligent ork snipers targeting their apothicaries on armageddion all within a month.\nAvarius knew the inquisition was coming for the chapter's reliquaries, and it was the combination of duty, dread, and outrage at the inquisition's (as he saw it) underhanded murder of each of his battle brothers, and of his entire chapter, that finally gave chaos a hold on the Psyker, causing him to turn his back on the Imperium.\nNow embracing \"the path of glory\" he turned over the relics, weapons, and knowalge of the chapter to priates, private collectors, tossed a few into space and the warp for good measure to keep them out of inquisitorial hands, and fled for his life into the Screaming Vortex.\nNow this embittered idealist is out for inquisitoral blood, using his psychic powers to face his foes and flay them alive. Dispite this entire ordeal somthing of the conditioning stuck with him, he still believes the emperor cares for his people... but that the inquisition, high lords of terra, and their military machine, keep him trapped upon the golden throne, woshiping him as a god when he clearly is not.\nI took a weapon downgrade (the cursed metal downgrade) to lower the rarity of the weapon by one step, thereby making it very rare, and able to be taken as a cursed heirloom. If that isn't allowed by the rules, then I'll have to select a new weapon, though I do personally like having a cursed exotic weapon. If that element of the character is disruptive or takes focus away from the story, I can delete it and select something else, such as outdoors and tracking skills or another minion, for flavor.\nhas anyone heard from warg since being told if you were accepted or not?\nI am rewriting some stuff at the moment, plus having alot of work to handle at the moment. I'll have more info coming up on Monday night.\no.o speak of the devil.\nIts alright, I was just wondering if i had somehow fallen out of the loop.\nStarted up a OOC for the players!\nThank you all for showing interest, positions are closed.\ngetting the hang of character creation!\nspells picked, weapons looked over, all traits done, i feel like a kid in a candy store with even my basic equipment.",

    "text": "Today I would like to talk about yet another unique embroidery tradition of the Dnister corridor, This river separates the historic districts of Pokuttia and Podillia. This region is incredibly rich in embroidery techniques. This technique is mostly known for being used on the ends of the ancient woman's headpiece, the peremitka, which is a long narrow piece of linen which is wound around the head and neck of married women. The ends of this garment were always decorated either with a woven design or with embroidery. These ornemented ends were called 'zabir'. The edges were sometimes also ornamented, usually with simple woven designs. Here are some women in Horoden'ka district costume wearing peremitky.\nThis type of embroidery was used on women's chemises as well, but lasted longest on the zabory because it could be made to look almost the same on both sides.\nThe image at the top of the article is a good example of this technique, even though the photo is somewhat washed out. I will be using several images which are of rather poor quality, and i apologize that i was not able to find better.\nThe framework for these designs was laid out in black cross stich, or sometimes stem stich. For the zabir, double sided cross stitch was used. Then colors were filled in with a herringbone or pine type stitch, which started from the center line of the outlined area and extended diagonally to the outer edge. This was often executed in silk thread, and sometimes in metallic thread as an accent..Some of the outlines, and often decorative elements on the edge of the design were done with Holbein stitch.Other stitches were used for the edging, including buttonhole and chain stitch.\nElements which are equilateral end up looking almost like eyelets, but they are not pulled open. The primary colors used are dark reds, edging into maroon and purple with other colors used as accents.\nSome designs use stem stitch instead of cross stitch, and are curvilinear. The filling is done in the same way however.\nMany designs are symmetrical about the diagonal axis, which is similar to embroidery designs in the Balkans.\nAnd of course, wherever creative embroiderers existed, variations on the technique also existed.\nMore recently, this technique, as with so many others, was imitated with cross-stitch. Here are two shoulder insets from women's chemises with the same design, one done in rozchokhy, and the other in cross stitch.\nAnd another pair, from zabory.\nIn fact, it is my belief that many designs in this area with strong black outlines of individual motifs which are today only found in cross stitch were originally executed in rozchokha. It would be interesting to reverse engineer these designs.\nI suppose I should mention that some of these designs were deliberately left unfinished so as to more clearly show the structure.\nOccasionally you will see a remnant of rozchokha in a cross stitch design.\nThis technique has today been revived, and is being taught in places like the Uchylyshche in L'viw. New designs using the technique are also being invented. I had such a piece in my personal collection, but it was borrowed and never returned.\nThis is a beautiful part of the creative heritage of Ukraine and the world, and I would encourage you to try it. This technique has a great deal of potential.\nThank you for reading. I will close with some more images of pieces done in this technique.\nHello, Roman. Thanks for this post! I thought, that on Pokuttya peremitkas was mainly woven (like this from Jaseniv-Pilny http://hutsul.museum/collection/77/341/ ), but your post opened my eyes to the wonderful local version of embroidered peremitkas. I don't have the 3rd Iryna Svyontek's book, so I ask you, is there in the book how to do this embroidery?\nBy the way, \"some women in Horoden'ka district costume wearing peremitky\" are the folk band \"Peremitka\" from village Luka, Horodenka raion and you can watch their performance on youtube http://youtu.be/YT6eFkwiKBE .\nThank you, Nawko, I would like to know where I could find her other two books. I have not found them available here.\nShe does not show how to do this embroidery, but you can save and enlarge the black and white images and be able to see how it is done.It is pretty obvious.framework in cross stitch and outline stitch, filling with herringbone or sosnytsia. Most books on Ukrainian embroidery cover this, for example the one by Diakiw O neil. It is called plait stitch, or peremitkovy show or Horodenkovy stib, or somesuch.

Embroidery in Ukraine as in many other places was considered to be essential. It was, and to some extent still is, a visible mark of your good taste, how marriageable you are, and evidence of proper householding skills. Untill about the 1930's, all the cloth and thread for embroidered items were made at home, by hand. Today we pay exorbitant prices for good linen, but in those days, it was much more available. Even when commercial thread began to be used, it was never that expensive. Secondly, these clothes were not worn for a season and then discarded, as we unfortunately do today. Linen is extremely durable, and an embroidered garment could be worn for decades. This is especially true for the most extensively embroidered garments which were only worn for important occasions, or perhaps for church on Sunday, at most. Everyday clothes would eventually wear out, and had less embroidery, but even then would be recycled as footcloths, baby swaddling and the like. This was not much done by city women untill the 1930's when it became fashionable to have an ethnic identity. The woman in the villages worked on the family farm, and for much of the year agricultural work does leave one with a great deal of free time, excepting only planting time and harvest. Also, one of the most important things that young girls were expected to do was to prepare their trousseau; A girl was not considered to be ready for marriage untill she had a proper collection of embroidered clothes and household linens prepared, often including a shirt for her future spouse. Women would also embroider shirts for their husbands and sons. It was considered to be an extremely strong protective talisman for a young man to go out into the world with a shirt embroidered by his mother. Embroidery was never considered to be just 'a hobby', it formed a vital part of life. This has not completely been lost in Ukrainian culture even today. And of course, all of this applies to many other peoples as well.\nOhh,thank you, Roman; very informative.\nHi.. Great post.

    "text": "The bullpen collapsed again as the Diamondbacks lost for the 13th time in the past 19 games.\nDENVER \u2013 The cast has changed for the Diamondbacks, only they keep playing out the same tired script, one brutal night after another. In a deathly quiet visitors\u2019 clubhouse, players sat motionless in front of their lockers late Wednesday night, seemingly stunned by the realization that their misery could reach new depths.\nYoshihisa Hirano, only recently given the reins in the closer\u2019s role, became the latest Diamondbacks reliever to get beat in excruciating fashion, serving up D.J. LeMahieu\u2019s opposite-field, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth of a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night.\nThe Diamondbacks were two outs away from shaving their deficit in the National League West to just 1 1/2 games. Instead, it could grow to 4 1/2 games by the time they leave town on Thursday evening.\nHanded a 4-3 lead in the ninth, Hirano allowed a leadoff single to Gerardo Parra, a hard-hit ball that first baseman Paul Goldschmidt could not handle, and, two batters later, Hirano left a fastball over the plate that LeMahieu smacked into the right-field seats.\nThey did get a lead. They did get a solid outing from lefty Patrick Corbin. And they did get good relief work through the eighth inning. But while the ninth was a disaster, the Diamondbacks\u2019 offense once again gave the pitching staff little breathing room.\nWith one out in the fourth, Alex Avila launched a solo home run to center field to extend the Diamondbacks\u2019 lead to 4-2. It was the last baserunner the Diamondbacks would have, as the Rockies retired 17 consecutive batters through the end of the game.\nRockies relievers recorded 15 of those outs, marking the first time in the franchise\u2019s 25-year history the bullpen recorded five perfect innings.\nIt was the eighth consecutive game decided by one run that the Diamondbacks have lost. This season, they\u2019re just 18-28 in one-run games.\nBut the Diamondbacks\u2019 recent misery is not limited to one-run games. Nineteen games ago, they were a first-place team. But their 6-13 stretch has resulted in a five-game swing in the standings, with the Diamondbacks now sitting in third place with 16 games remaining.\nParra smoked the first pitch he saw from Hirano on one hop to Goldschmidt. It came off his bat at 98 mph, and Goldschmidt tried to play the ball to his left on a short hop. He couldn\u2019t do so cleanly.\nAfter a Charlie Blackmon sac bunt, LeMahieu hit a 1-1 fastball, a pitch that Hirano wanted down and away but instead went up and over the plate.\n\u201cIt got away and it was kind of up where he could hit it,\u201d Hirano said, speaking through interpreter Kelvin Kondo.\nIt was the eighth time the Diamondbacks\u2019 bullpen had suffered a loss in the past 15 games.",

    "text": "Tijdens de opening van de 57e Tong Tong Fair op 27 mei 2015 bracht de Indonesische schrijfster en journalist Leila S. Chudori een ode aan het festival. Chudori maakte in 2014 voor het eerst kennis met de Tong Tong Fair en sprak nu over hoe zij \u201cde magie van het evenement\u201d had ervaren als een viering van de unieke identiteit van de Indo-Europeaan. Zij roemde met name de literaire discussies, dansvoorstellingen, muziek en film tijdens het Tong Tong Festival, die ervoor zorgen dat niet alleen terug wordt gekeken op het verleden, maar vooral actief op zoek wordt gegaan naar de huidige Indo-Europese identiteit.\nChudori definieerde de Tong Tong Fair als \u201ceen laboratorium waar de betekenis van de Nederlands-Indonesische cultuur wordt geherdefinieerd.\u201d Voor een omschrijving van die unieke identiteit verwees zij terug naar de woorden van de Indische schrijver (en oprichter van Tong Tong) Tjalie Robinson, die de Indische Nederlanders eens vergeleek met een schildpad: in staat om zowel op land als in zee te leven. Thuis in meerdere werelden. Al met al is de Tong Tong Fair volgens Chudori dan ook met recht te typeren als een \u201ccelebration of diversity\u201d.\nChudori is aanwezig tijdens de Tong Tong Fair waar zij ge\u00efnterviewd zal worden over haar nieuwste boek Pulang dat binnenkort zal verschijnen als Naar huis in de Nederlandse vertaling van Henk Maier. De roman is een familiegeschiedenis tegen de achtergrond van de gebeurtenissen in 1965, de communistenjacht die daarop volgde en de ballingschap die toen voor sommige Indonesi\u00ebrs begon. Met dit boek won de schrijfster in 2013 de belangrijkste Indonesische literaire prijs, Khatulistiwa Literary Award.\nHierbij haar Engelstalige speech van 27 mei 2015.\nA small town. A small community. The town is called Den Haag and the community consists of Dutch-Indonesians who gather under a festival called Tong Tong Fair, that was born 56 years ago under the name of Pasar Malam Besar.\nAfter I grew up, of course I learnt about the Pasar Malam Besar, a celebration and festival that was important for Dutch-Indos living in Holland but it was only last year, I experienced Tong Tong Fair, that has metamorphosed from the Pasar Malam Besar. My first encounter gave me a new outlook in that, Tong Tong Fair was not just a celebration to gather and enjoy good food, fun tunes and reminisce about the past.\nInside Malieveld, where Tong Tong Fair is held, I witnessed magic. In this wide field, suddenly, there were two large islands emerging without notice, alive and enchanting the visitors for two weeks.\nIt was as if Tjalie Robinson\u2019s vision was realized into Tong Tong Fair and everything inside it, a unique island that has been sustained and became a part of Holland (and Indonesia); an island and community that refuses to melt and drown into the Western culture.\nEntering Tong Tong Fair in Malieveld was like entering a celebration of diversity in the middle of Den Haag that is so \u2018white\u2019 and so \u2018Dutch\u2019: there is music of the past: keroncong, gamelan, and even Indonesian rock, which, in my opinion, has different beats and rhythms to rock music from the West that I knew; there\u2019s the Looming Fire exhibition that displays a series of documentaries of the day-to-day lives of Dutch and Dutch-Indo families in Hindia Belanda in the 1940s. And of course, here and there, we see various forms of arts and crafts and art works that are Indonesian to the very core: wayang and batik.\nIn addition to that, the air in Malieveld mingles with the scent of Indonesian food, not only satay and fried rice, but even complex Indonesian dishes like lamb curry and lontong sayur that has been served complete with serious and accurate seasonings.\nHowever, the important aspects that are interesting and close to my heart are the literary discussions; dance performances, music, screenings and discussions of Indonesian films, that give an indication that Tong Tong Fair is a community that has metamorphosed into a laboratory that has redefined the meaning of Dutch-Indonesian culture.\nBy adding to the vocabulary of Indonesian culture, and reaffirming the sanctity of the Dutch Culture, then the Dutch-Indo community will too, blossom. This community is successful in their attempts to record and absorb various positive aspects, that are interesting and unique from both cultures.\nFrom what I learned last year, Tong Tong Fair is no longer a definition for melancholy and nostalgia. Nostalgia is merely something sentimental that pains us because what we had is no longer within our grasp. I do not feel that Tong Tong Fair merely wants to caress the shape of the culture of our past that have now become museum artifacts. In actuality, they desire to chase the progress and the diversity of modern Indonesian culture, which, must be admitted, has become a part of Dutch-Indo culture.\nThe history of the exiled community and the following generation are quite different from that of the Dutch-Indo\u2019s, but one of its many similarities is, that many of the second generation share the same history and blood in their body; those who realize this, whether they like it or not, have a pair of father and mother: Indonesia and Holland.\nHere, the blood in those veins is composed of Indonesians and the Dutch.\nThe uniqueness of Tong Tong Fair, that was born from Tjalie\u2019s idea was not merely celebration of revisiting; it is not merely a celebration of nostalgia nor sentimentality. It began with a need of a \u201cdeclaration\u201d of the independent of Dutch-Indo identities. The implications of this statement were the marriage of two cultures, two traditions, and two languages which influence each other, intercrossing, and caressing in an entity: a community of Indo-Belanda. I think this community is celebrating a new independent identity; one that proclaims the shape of art and community is something unique, but still is a part of two countries: Indonesia and Holland.\nFor me, this is a way to give respect to those two (or more) cultures; or as Tjalie said: to two or more natures like the turtle. These two cultures, at one point may have become a part of a history of conflict and blood, but now has blossomed into a feeling of ownership and togetherness. For me, turtles do not only live in the sea and on land, but they can also fly.",

Attendees will be provided handouts and a workbook specific to this workshop as additional references for the practitioner\u2019s use.\nMarriage and divorce are both common experiences. In Western cultures, more than 90 percent of people marry by age 50. Healthy marriages are good for couples\u2019 mental and physical health. They are also good for children; growing up in a happy home protects children from mental, physical, educational and social problems. However, about 40 to 50 percent of married couples in the United States divorce. The divorce rate for subsequent marriages is even higher. Adapted from the Encyclopedia of Psychology.\nApproximately 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, with most children of divorced parents in the United States (40 percent of all children) adjusting to their reconfigured family structure. However, 20 to 25 percent of children have trouble dealing with their new circumstances, which can create a variety of personal issues including mood disorders, developmental regression, academic failure and aggression. (Divorce Statistics, 2007).\nDivorce rearranges the family unit and schedule, but doesn\u2019t end the family because parents will continue to parent long after the divorce. Yet, divorce always comes down to two elements: finances and children. The ability of the parents to navigate their divorce as amicably as possible paves the best path to their ability to communicate and co- parent (and \u201cgrandparent\u201d) post-divorce. The children\u2019s routines, relationships and even environment may change, yet healthy attachments to their parents can remain and even strengthen if parents take responsibility for separating, divorcing and moving forward with their lives in an appropriate and positive way. Mental health professionals have a unique opportunity to assist separating/divorcing parents and their children through this life transition.\nIdentifying what property is considered a marital asset and how liabilities are treated in the divorce process.

    "text": "On yet another summer weekend in New York City, yesterday evening I was back at the Avery Fisher Hall for, incidentally, another performance of Brahms' Symphony No. 4 and, most importantly, a solo piece by Bach and a piano concerto by Mozart \u2212 It is his festival, after all \u2212 performed by one of the Mostly Mozart Festival's main attractions, our very own Jeremy Denk.\nThe other differences from last weekend would be the seats and the company as my friend Angie had been replaced by my equally dear friend Christine, and we found ourselves in much lesser (and ironically paid for this time) seats in the packed concert hall. But the complimentary flutes of champagne that we got to leisurely sip on the Avery Fisher Hall's balcony overlooking Lincoln Plaza before the concert certainly helped alleviate to some degree the indignity of going back to the nose-bleed section's last row one week after tasting the fleeting pleasure of the center of the orchestra section. A bit like going back to flying Coach after enjoying a stint in First Class (or so I've heard).\nBach's Chaconne from his Partita in D Minor for solo violin is famous for being one of the most extraordinary \u2212 and extraordinarily difficult \u2212 works of the classical music repertoire. Brahms managed to make it even more daunting when he boldly came up with his own transcription of it for the left hand only, a formidable token of his admiration for Bach and his love for Clara Schumann, to whom the composition was dedicated. Seemingly all alone in the darkened concert hall, which cleverly made the grand performance feel downright intimate, Jeremy Denk was in full command of his remarkable skills, starting in a subdued way before handling the countless tricky challenges with the expertise and ease of the ultimate connoisseur. More than just a flamboyant tour de force, this Chaconne was also a richly imaginative and strongly expressive musical adventure.\nAfter recovering the use of both hands, Jeremy Denk just as dexterously tackled Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20, which happened to include Brahms' own cadenza last night. Although the music retained Mozart's trademark elegance and lyricism, which especially stood out in the stunning Romanze movement, it also betrayed some uncharacteristically dark and agitated passages, which immediately brought to my mind Don Giovanni at its most dramatic. Completely unfazed, Jeremy Denk negotiated the various moods with flawless technical expertise and genuine emotional finesse, the orchestra superbly coming through on their own under Louis Langr\u00e9e's highly collaborative baton.\nAnd because the going was so good the soloist just kept going on his own. Our thunderous ovation earned us a poignant interpretation of the 13th variation of Bach's Goldberg Variations, adroitly taking us right back where our evening started.\nAfter intermission, I had the pleasure of hearing Brahms' Symphony No. 4 again, and the journey was about just as sweepingly intense as it had been the previous week. If nothing else, the orchestra sounded in even finer shape and responded even more robustly to Louis Langr\u00e9e's unwaveringly spot-on and deeply involved conducting. As the endless ovation was slowly subsiding, we dashed out of the hall and made it to the L'Arte del Gelato cart located right around the corner in record time for the de rigueur stop before enjoying our refreshing treats with a view over the Hearst Plaza. Because some traditions are just too good to pass on.",

    "text": "Having spent my Sunday morning watching the Digital Foundary analysis of the, \u201cWolfenstein 2: The New Colossus\u201d I have come to an interesting question, \u201cDoes the form and function of the game matter more than the graphical prowess of a game?\u201d This ultimately depends on the person reading this, but I would argue that the wider populous would prefer form and function over something dazzling and lacking. For most of us who own a Nintendo Switch this is a reality that many of us have got to face. There are good looking games (Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being a prime example) on the Switch, but there are not amazing looking games. Many players are comfy in seeing what a game can look like on the Xbox One X or PS4 Pro and as a result have come to expect games that dazzle, while also delivering some semblance of functional gameplay.\nOn the other end of the spectrum are players who enjoy simple, graphically infused games with a larger emphasis on form and function. This is where the Nintendo Switch comes into play. As it is a console that lacks the horsepower of a Xbox or PlayStation, but its games have so much more depth to them; at least in my own opinion. The ephasis turns from graphics and more into trying to make a game run perfectly, without looking as dazzling. Take the latest release, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus as ported by Panic Button Studios is a prime example of a game that sacarifces graphics in an effort to perfectly maintain the core experience of the game. One that was done to near-perfection. Digital Foundry does a phenomenal job at breaking these efforts down and it has given me a larger appreciation for what the Nintendo Switch is capable of.\nHaving a console that is capable of running a game that was made purely for current-gen consoles is outstanding. With some clever alterations to the game engine and new codage to help smooth things out, Panic Button Studios has proven that no game is too big to port on over. That being said PC, Xbox and PlayStation enthusiast be warned: This game is not going to dazzle you at 60FPS with 4K HDR FLAMING HOT GRAPHICS! It might just look like a hot, fuzzy mess. Truth is, that\u2019s fine by me as I am getting a portable version of that game. I\u2019m getting Wolfenstein 2 to take with me on trips or vacations. Now of course some gamers will still be rather put off by the muted graphics and seemingly worse performance but this game is a superb example of maintaining form and function over something that just looks dazzling. Sure on the Xbox and PlayStation consoles you can have and eat your cake. You get stellard looks as well as feel, but does it really matter?\nThe Nintendo Switch is a curious console in the market, as it pushes the metaphorical bar further and further for mobile hardware. It forces gamers to respond to a decades old, master race question: Do I really need to have the most dazzling graphics to enjoy a game? I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that they are a nice addition, but not an absolute must for my own gaming taste. Sure my opinion may be in the minority or the majority, as it all depends on who you are asking. As a gamer I ask that you all take a look at the included video and see for yourself what is possible. I strongly believe that the more we start to look away from stunning 4K graphics and more to the form and function of a game can we start to get trurly spansive and genre breaking games, without being burdened by demanding asthetics.",

    "text": "FOWS Newsletter: August/September 2015 - Is Lake Tahoe really on the cutting edge of environmental planning?\nIs Lake Tahoe really on the cutting edge of environmental planning?\nTahoe plans include more parking spaces as groups undertake efforts to remove them.\nMaking matters worse, the proposed 2015 Lake Tahoe Restoration Act would amend the TRPA Compact to weaken TRPA's role in environmental protection by requiring TRPA to consider the (presumed) economic impacts of plan regulations. Keep in mind this is often what the corporations and large developers claim to be 'economic.' Their ideas of 'economic' (increasing their immediate [short-term] profits) are not based on truly helping our locally-owned/small businesses and communities, or long-term protection of Lake Tahoe. TRPA is currently the only agency with land use authority in the Lake Tahoe Basin charged with protecting Tahoe's environment; the economics of the Basin are already being monitored and prioritized by local entities (e.g. Counties), along with numerous groups (e.g. Resort Associations). Notably, the original TRPA Compact was strengthened in 1980 because local governments eyeing tax dollars were approving projects that harmed Tahoe's environment (although TRPA has, unfortunately, returned most project approval authority back to the counties, oversight is still required). The proposed Compact amendment will leave us with no land use authority that truly prioritizes Lake Tahoe's environment.\nAs depicted in our \"Tahoe Regional Overgrowth\" map, the North Tahoe Region is already facing substantial development proposals that will bring more people, more cars, and more crowding. We are not opposed to new development, but believe it should complement and respect Lake Tahoe's fragile environment and our unique communities - not overwhelm them. We will continue to keep you informed as these plans and projects proceed.\nOn August 7th, the TCPUD issued a \"Notice of Intent to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration and Notice of Public Hearing.\" After previously focusing on three properties, the Lodge site has been identified as the preferred location, which is on state-owned land managed by the California Tahoe Conservancy [CTC]. The CTC and TCPUD are considering a land swap involving a TCPUD-owned parcel off Lagoon Street. FOWS supports this project's proposed location and the associated land swap (read FOWS comments to the TCPUD).\nComments on the draft environmental document are due by 4:30pm on September 9, 2015, and may be provided in writing to Matt Homolka by email at mhomolka@tcpud.org or by mail to TCPUD, P.O. Box 5249, Tahoe City, CA 96145 or by hand delivery to the TCPUD offices at 221 Fairway Drive.\nYou can also ask questions by contacting Kurt Althof, Grants and Community Information Administrator, anytime at: kalthof@tcpud.org or (530) 580-6057.\n\"Restricting access and use of the area during treatment...may not be acceptable.\"\n\"Actively dewatering the Tahoe Keys lagoon could interfere with the recreational use of the facility.\"\n\"The cost of removing nutrient-laden sediments is high, would require permits, and impair the use of the coves during operations.\"\nThe report also fails to take a harder look at reducing the amount of nutrients released into the channels (which causes more weeds to grow), like addressing fertilizer use. Comments on the TKPOA's proposed Plan are due September 25.\nThe proposed project will include almost 1,500 new bedrooms (hotels, condos, and timeshares), a 90,000 sq. ft. indoor amusement park, and roughly 300,000 additional sq. ft. of new commercial uses.\nFOWS is extremely concerned about the proposed project's impacts to the Lake Tahoe Basin, including traffic (FOWS submitted comments on 7/14/2015). The draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) concludes 'significant and unavoidable' impacts to congestion in Tahoe City. Further, traffic impacts to the Basin (and West Shore) were not fully examined. For example, although the draft EIR identifies increased traffic on SR 89 along the West Shore, the impacts of these increases are not assessed. Comments from other organizations also identified significant problems with the analysis in the draft EIR, and an overwhelming majority of the nearly 315 public comments submitted opposed the size and scale of the proposed project. No release date for the Final EIR has been provided.\nThe inclusion of the Tahoe City Lodge \"Pilot Project\" and lack of defined criteria regarding \"Pilot Projects.\"\nThe upcoming TBAP environmental impact study/report (EIS/EIR) states it will analyze the area plan at a 'policy level' and the TC Lodge at a 'project level.' We believe the project should be analyzed separately from the Area Plan.\nThe 112 homes were proposed via a new Area Plan.\nWhen the public (including Realtor groups, Tahoe residents and groups, and Truckee residents) expressed concern, the idea for a new campground emerged.\nMeanwhile, the developer quietly attempted a boundary line amendment to have land on the ridge declared outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin, and thus not subject to TRPA regulations. FOWS strongly opposed this amendment, and it was dropped earlier this summer.\nNow, the precedent-setting, 550-unit \"Brockway Campground\" is proposed, with substantial development, including a general store, cafe/restaurant, swimming pool, family pavilion, and other structures.\nWhether the campground is a serious proposal, or a means to an end (such as the 112 luxury homes), like many others, we are concerned with any substantial development on Tahoe's famous ridgelines. The scenic impacts from Lake Tahoe and surrounding mountains should be enough to warrant ridgeline protection; add in the fire danger, limited roadway system, traffic, water demand, and other impacts, and protecting our ridgelines should be an easy decision, but requests to do so have not been addressed. We will keep you updated as more information becomes available.\n* If you haven't yet signed the Petition to Protect Tahoe's Ridgelines, we encourage you to do so.\nAnnual Report from Lake Tahoe Scientists: Keep Tahoe Blue, or Keep Tahoe Clear?\nThe 2015 State of the Lake Report, released by the Tahoe Environment Research Center (TERC) last month, includes new findings about Lake Tahoe's 'blueness' and clarity. Until now, improving clarity was assumed to also benefit the Lake's 'blueness'. But blueness and clarity are actually controlled by different things - blueness is controlled by the amount of algae in the water, while clarity is controlled by fine inorganic particles.\nThe key take-home message: if we want to have blue water, we have to reduce the nutrients that contribute to algae growth. The only proven way to do this is through natural ecosystem processes. Researchers warned: \"[We] need watershed restoration if [we] really want a blue [Lake].\"\nFor years, FOWS has advocated for the reduction of nutrients known to increase the algae along Tahoe's shorelines; in fact, it's one reason we challenged TRPA's 2012 Regional Plan Update, which encourages more pavement closer to the Lake, where watershed restoration is needed.\nConcentrations of attached algae 'near the shore' (called \"periphyton\") appear to have declined this year, but measurements were taken at different (lower) spots in the lake due to drought, so they aren't measuring the same locations or plant species as previous years.\nWe are pleased with the ongoing support from our existing and new members and supporters. We look forward to ongoing interaction with all who share the desire to protect the West Shore and Lake Tahoe. That said, we kindly include this 'gentle request' for your annual membership dues , and encourage new supporters to join. Your tax-deductible dues will help support ongoing efforts of the only organization providing a collective voice for West Shore communities (and beyond). If you aren't a member already, here's how your membership helps . Individual memberships are as low as $25 (although additional donations are welcome), and information for Homeowners Associations can be found here . If you have questions, ideas, suggestions, or just want to shoot the breeze on Tahoe issues, please feel free to contact us ! Dues may be paid online or mailed to FOWS .\nWe invite you to contact us to learn more, ask questions, or simply get to know the FOWS Board. Also, don't forget to follow us on Facebook!\nPlease contact Jennifer Quashnick, FOWS Conservation Consultant, at: jqtahoe@sbcglobal.net , or Susan Gearhart, FOWS President, at: susan@friendswestshore.org (530) 525-0368.",

The invalidation execution path seems slower than it needs to be.\n2. As the QC invalidate a subset of queries, all other threads need to wait. This means that any performance issue in (1) will be multiplied by the number of waiting threads. The wait is a regression compared to the patch in 21074 as a result of fixing bug43758 which enabled us to refactor the lock API to use a consistent approach to locking the QC.\nTo find hotspots in the invalidation path I've used dtrace sampling on a test case invalidating 1 GB of data from a single table. From this I see that my_hash_sort_bin() and my_hash_delete() are potential bottle necks.\nmy_hash_sort_bin() is used when calculating the hash for a binary string and the function used comes from the strings/ directory.\nA close inspection on my_hash_delete() using google perf tools doesn't give away too many clues though (see attachment).\nIt also seems likely that the linear search performed within each memory bin can be inefficient with certain load patterns. I wasn't able to show this with my test case though.\nUnfortunately I turns out that gprof doesn't work in macosx and for some reason and Shark refuses to sample a running mysqld process.

The Eleventh Release won\u2019t include a one term that may become obsolete before the season 2050.\u2019 I\u2019ve n\u2019t actually noticed the Northern Lights. Fully being a real author is something he\u2019s a unique zeal to turn into in his own existence, but as of this moment, he is attempting, expecting to be a well-known one one day.\nLocate a quotation that states some thing very similar to your own investigation and set it to use as assistance for your own notions. Consider me, as one which has been there, you really should think of the things you\u2019ll be lacking. I chanced upon the picture on line. The business has a superb small company product, which might be differed in comparison to firms who might run their qualities. Social marketing is among the very best strategies to distribute the term about your own independent makeup artist business. The history of the business is incredibly complicated. Instead of simply making an everyday little company card, make your small business save and put it to use in order to fit into useful books within the collection. Here are a few hints I\u2019ve realized thus far on how better to endure on an extremely restricted budget.\nThese standard guidelines will keep their article writing skills sharp.\nI made the decision that utilizing the total of five things is a great place to begin I\u2019ve worked each day to conquer hunger in my entire life. I\u2019ll utilize my entire life as a good instance.",

In order to do that, I would need to establish a morning routine AND wake up 30-40 minutes earlier than usual.\nI immediately became overwhelmed just thinking about this and already anticipating my failure. Considering I am not much of a morning person, and don\u2019t work out EVER, this is a rather ambitious goal.\n*Deep Breath* Upon reading further I learned that many people have a burst of motivation when they start a new habit \u2013 however this quickly fades after a slight slip up or when you realize there may be limits to your motivation. This is why itis important that your habit be EASY PEASY and require little to no motivation!\n\u2022\tDrink a full glass of water before my feet hit the floor (I leave it at my bedside all night, so I guess I ingest a little dust as well, maybe a gnat. Whatever).\n\u2022\tGo to the bathroom (I told you, easy, no motivation, but super exciting to cross off your list).\n\u2022\tClean out kitty kat\u2019s litter box (something I would sometimes have no problem skipping before initiating this challenge).\n\u2022\tEnjoy a cup of coffee (never actually skipped this before).\n\u2022\tTake vitamins (when I don\u2019t eat breakfast, I don\u2019t bother taking vitamins because you\u2019re supposed to take them with food. So this is another one that was easily skipped).\nYes, most of this stuff is stuff I would do anyway, but now I am doing it consciously, consistently, SKIPPING NOTHING, every day.\nI am only implementing this routine on BUSINESS DAYS. I have a feeling this is frowned up. But we\u2019re just going to go with it for now. I am on (business day) 9.\nAnyway, only one day in the last nine did I forget my vitamins. My first instinct was to recoil in failure, but I went easy on myself and just made sure I got back on the track the next (business) day.\nAnother important part of this challenge is logging your progress and being held ACCOUNTABLE. This is where YOU - my fellow habit changers come in!\nSo even though I\u2019m already a few days in \u2013 from here on I will check in each day to let everyone know I\u2019ve accomplished my EASY PEASY morning routine and will offer support and encouragement to the rest of you.",

    "text": "The chaos that the shortage of qualified Primary-Care Physicians is causing in the United States is glaringly obvious. It does not help that more and more family doctors announce they are giving up their practice in favor of becoming private doctors, taking cash-only patients while others decide to sell their practices to hospitals.\nIn 2012, the New York Times reported that America was short almost 9,000 Primary-Care Physicians. That number is expected to have gone up drastically since then as more are being let go or choosing to let go voluntarily. This shortage is expected to grow even more acute in the next 15 years, with a projected shortfall of an estimated 65,000 doctors. These are family doctors, general internists, general pediatricians and geriatricians \u2013 the doctors who diagnose new illnesses, manage chronic ones, advocate preventive care and protect wellness.\nTake a look at some of the most compelling reasons why choosing to become a primary care physician in the US today is an excellent idea.\nAccording to the American Academy of Family Physicians, the demand for family physicians in the USA is expected to exceed the supply by the year 2020. In such a scenario, the demand for primary-care physicians is expected to grow exponentially as the shortage worsens. This means you are never going to be out of a job for a long time to come.\nFor a long time, one of the main reasons why this specialty was often featured last on the list of most preferred fields for med students was the low wages associated with it. A lot has changed in recent years though. According to a report published by a reputed medical magazine lately, the average earnings for primary-care physicians shot up by about 5.2%, which is a faster rise than those of other specialists.\nMoreover, primary-care physicians working in underserved regions enjoy handsome tax benefit incentives with Medicare currently providing a 10 % bonus payment.\nIn the past, many people would only go to hospital emergency rooms when they got sick instead of seeing a regular doctor. All of this is expected to change as of January 1, 2014 when the Obamacare insurance plans or the Affordable Care Act comes into effect and the newly insured start seeking care. Many authorities project that the growing patient demand for services could cause the health care system to crash. The newly insured will all need Primary-Care Providers.\nThe practice of primary care medicine is not easy. In fact, it is often characterized as one of the most challenging careers within the field of medicine. Despite this, the immense personal satisfaction and pleasure that is derived from successful patient care is what often drives future PCPs into the field.",

    "text": "Over the past 17-years and despite the ongoing conflict drugs production has surged to record levels in Afghanistan.\nIn July 2000 it was reported that the Taliban had banned the cultivation of poppies for opiates, claiming it was \u201cun-Islamic\u201d. By May 2001 that ban had all but put an end the country\u2019s drug trade. In one growing season alone the country\u2019s drug production ground to a virtual halt.\nFive months later New York was rocked by the World Trade Center attacks, however. Following Sept 11 it was reported that the alleged mastermind behind the attacks, bin Laden, was hiding somewhere in Afghanistan.\nWeeks later a U.S. led invasion was underway and although bin Laden was never located in Afghanistan the country\u2019s drugs trade was quickly restored.\nOf course this is all now history but it is vital to understanding what has happened in Afghanistan. Bin Laden was not the reason for the U.S. led invasion. Like claims that he was the mastermind behind 9/11, that was just a smokescreen. The restoration of the country\u2019s drugs trade was the real reason and that\u2019s why the U.S. and its coalition allies are likely to remain in the country. Ed.\nAn unprecedented surge of high quality and low-cost Afghan heroin is bound for the world\u2019s streets after the country\u2019s opium crop jumped two thirds to record levels, the United Nations has warned.\nAfghanistan\u2019s farmers grew more than 1,250 square miles of opium poppy last year, paving the way for potentially unseen levels of heroin production.\nThe bumper crop has the potential to make up to 900 tonnes of high purity, export quality heroin the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime said.\nAfghan opium already provides more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s heroin and 95 percent of that found on Britain\u2019s streets.\nThe trade also finances militant groups such as the Taliban, forcing the UK to spend tens of millions in the past 15 years trying to destroy poppy crops.\nBut production in Helmand province alone, the capital of opium growing where Britain spent eight years trying to wean Afghans off the crop, has risen by 79 percent in a single year.\n\u201cWith the record high of production in 2017, a wave of high quality, low-cost heroin is expected to reach consumer markets across the world,\u201d the UN warned.\nPoor security and the Kabul government\u2019s lack of control in swathes of the country were blamed for the burgeoning trade.\nOpium now dwarfs all other sectors of the Afghan economy, despite a 17-year-long international aid campaign to try to rebuild the country after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001.\nThe crop was worth up to \u00a35bn, or nearly a third of the country\u2019s entire GDP, while legal exports are worth only around seven percent. Many billions more are made further down the drugs pipeline, as it is smuggled across the Middle East into Europe.\nImpoverished farmers are now increasingly reliant on the crop, and it is now the backbone of Afghan agriculture, making efforts to curb the trade harder.\nBritain has scaled back in recent years on aid efforts designed to encourage farmers to grow crops other than opium, but the National Crime Agency works with Afghan police to try to catch traffickers or seize their wealth.",

    "text": "All children under seventeen are Slated if they break the rules, cause trouble, or rebel against society. To keep peace and order, the government supplies the people who are Slated with Levos, which is a device that is attached to you at all times. The Levo\u2019s main purpose is to prevent discord. By thinking of violence, becoming scared, or being angry, the Levo stops the blood circulation to the brain and causes the person with the Levo to black out. If someone tries to take off their Levo, it causes them severe pain and may lead to death. Kyla has been Slated, and her personality and memory have both been wiped out. She is adopted to her family consisting of her mother, her father, and her older sister, Amy. As the story progresses, Kyla goes to school and meets Ben, an attractive young man that has also been Slated, and wants to know about his past. As people begin to rebel against the government, chaos breaks out, and more and more people begin to disappear. Some are taken away by government agents in front of everyone, and some are sneakily sent to the hospital to be Slated. Together, Kyla and Ben attempt to discover the loopholes around the system that may lead them to their past. However, doing so might also affect their future in ways that will not allow any second chances.\nSimilar to many other books that I have read, this book was very slow. The author took a tremendous amount of time revealing the characters and their personalities, which caused the climax to be relatively late in the story. Overall, this book disappointed me. I thought that I would be inseparable from the book, but there were no extreme pivotal moments or plot twists that made it hard for me to abandon from reading. As I continued to read the story, many of my theories had been proved to be true. The ending was also very predictable and the story was not as entertaining as it could have been. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries mixed with some romance. There was nothing inappropriate, no explicit language, and only a slight mention of drugs, so this would be a good book for children from ages eleven to thirteen. Teens may not find this book sensible because the vocabulary was very weak and the content was also meant for younger children. Because of the lack of liveliness in the story, I would rate this book a five out of ten stars.\n1. Why does Kyla\u2019s mother yell at Kyla when they are driving home from the hospital?\n1a. Kyla\u2019s mother yells at Kyla because she asked Kyla what she wanted to do, but Kyla did not answer her, possibly showing disrespect toward her mother (Page 10).\n2. Based on what was said by Kyla\u2019s mother and father, how are Kyla and Amy different?\n2a. Amy was very talkative and giggly when she met her parents, but Kyla seems different, odd, and more paranoid toward them (Page 16).\n3. How does Kyla react when she is cut by a knife when washing the dishes?\n3a. Because Kyla has never seen blood before, she is fascinated by the bright red liquid flowing down her hand (Page 27).\n4. Why is Kyla\u2019s mother sensitive toward Aunt Stacey\u2019s son, Robert?\n4a. Before Kyla\u2019s mother met Kyla\u2019s father, she had a son named Robert with another man. After separating from this man, Kyla\u2019s mother met her father and Robert died. In memory of Robert, Aunt Stacey named her son after him. Now, whenever Kyla\u2019s mother sees Aunt Stacey\u2019s toddler, she is uncomfortable (Pages 58-59).\n5. Why was Kyla surprised after her confrontation with Phoebe in the bus?\n5a. After Phoebe tripped Kyla, Kyla was ready to fight her, but this thought should have caused her to faint, but didn\u2019t. One of the Levo\u2019s main causes was to prevent any violent thinking that may lead to discord, which leads to the stop of blood circulation to the brain (Pages 85-86).\n6. What is Mr. Ferguson\u2019s first impression of Kyla?\n6a. Kyla arrives to the bus with Ben, so he assumes that she is one of Ben\u2019s groupies and is not there to run, but to only be with Ben (Pages 118-119).\n7. Why does Kyla burst into tears when she breaks a glass cup?\n7a. Kyla tells her mother that she is crying because she hates broccoli, but the real reason is because she is worried that her mother will send her back to the hospital, similar to what Tori\u2019s family had done (Pages 134-135).\n8. After Phoebe snatches Kyla\u2019s sketch book and sees the drawing of Sebastian, why does Phoebe immediately hand the book back to Kyla?\n8a. Phoebe works at the animal shelter, so when someone brought Sebastian in, he was given to her and she began to take care of him. Once Phoebe saw Sebastian in Kyla\u2019s book, she was shocked and realized that Sebastian was Kyla\u2019s cat. Later, Phoebe helps return Sebastian to Kyla (Pages 156-159).\n9. What does Mr. Gianelli do to make the Lorders arrest him?\n9a. In art class, the topic for the day was to draw someone or something that you care about. Mr. Gianelli draws Phoebe and posts it at the front of the class. The Lorders consider this as an act of protest, so he is punished (Pages 185, 189-190).\n10. Why does Mr. Ferguson shake his head when Ben and Kyla are done with their run?\n10a. Ben and Kyla are both Slated, so they are unable to compete in the cross country team. It is implied that they either broke the track record or simply have a very fast time, disappointing Mr. Ferguson because they are simply not allowed to be on the team (Pages 186-187).\n11. Why did Kyla go running when Amy and Jazz were studying?\n11a. A couple days before, Kyla saw Phoebe at the hospital. She was in a wheelchair, her personality was insanely different, and Amy realized that she had been Slated. Kyla believed that Phoebe\u2019s parents would want to know that Phoebe was healthy and safe, so she found Phoebe\u2019s address in a textbook and went to her house to inform Phoebe\u2019s parents (Page 235-236).\n12. Why did Hatten call Kyla a biological anomaly?\n12a. In class, the students were doing an experiment involving looking at a marking with one eye closed at a time. Most of the students could see with the eye on the same side as their dominant hand. For example, right-handed students could see the marking with their right eye. However, it was different for Kyla. She saw the marking with her left eye, but Hatten thought she was right-handed, so it did not make sense. The reason why Kyla was different was because she had been instructed to write with her right hand since she was young, but she had been left-handed all along, as she discovered when she was sketching (Page 246).\n13. Why doesn\u2019t Kyla\u2019s mother go places when she drops Kyla off at Group?\n13a. On every pole, there are cameras that monitor the identity and position of every car in London. If Kyla\u2019s mother wandered around beyond expectation, she might be punished for it (Page 258).\n14. Why does Ben seem more distant from Kyla as the story progresses?\n14a. Ben has already set his mind to take his Levo off. Unfortunately, this is a very dangerous task and it is very likely that Ben will die in the process. By keeping away from Kyla, Ben believes that Kyla won\u2019t be associated with Ben when the government finds out that he took his Levo off (Page 287).\n15. How does Nico, or Hatten, relate with Kyla?\n15a. Nico was someone that watched over Kyla and taught her valuable things when she was young and referred to as Lucy. He trained Kyla to be a shy, pathetic, and innocent little girl, but have an alternate ego as a killer. Eventually, the Lorders took control of Kyla\u2019s brain and she was Slated. Nico changed his clothes, his roles, and his name to Hatten and began to work at Kyla\u2019s school. He must have done something to harm Ms. Fern so that he could become the teacher at Kyla\u2019s school, where he had been trying to make Kyla remember her past so she could be an asset to him for situations in the future (Page 345).",

    "text": "WESTERN DESERT, EGYPT (31 March 2018) \u2014 Even though I had read that \u201cCrystal Mountain\u201d wasn\u2019t a mountain, on first glance I was a bit disappointed that it was not more dramatic. Somehow I still expected a sparkling glass-like entity rising up from the desert sands. Instead it seemed to be more of an ordinary looking ridge formation, not terribly distinguishable from the rest of the desert. Then as I took a walk, I began to see and understand the hidden magic.\nAll the crumbling rocks on the \u201cmountain\u201d are made up of delicate \u201ccrystals,\u201d that shimmer in the sand. I climbed up and around, being careful not to \u201cbreak\u201d off any of the pieces. This was the perfect example of how the desert can be harsh and fragile at the same time. The desolate landscape and rough-hewn profile hide the delicateness of mother nature\u2019s art.\nI am not sure of the geological explanation for this oddity, but it fascinated me as I continued to explore it. Some say it is calcite crystal others say it is quartz. The \u201ccrystals\u201d are semi-transparent white-ish rectangular pieces, and in my imagination they seemed like rough diamonds.",

    "text": "\"The reason I enjoy working with Robert Rodriguez is because he likes to play.\" So says Meredith Johns of Hawgfly Productions, Rodriguez's favored, Austin-based special makeup effects outfit that brings the gore galore.\n\"It's a little stressful sometimes because you don't always know what he wants until, well, five minutes before he wants it. But apparently I'm masochistic,\" she adds, \"because I really enjoy that. It's like, okay, what do you need? Six heads? Okay!\"\nHawgfly, which has worked on both of Rodriguez's forays into edged weaponry and rollicking, grindhouse-y ultra-violence -- they memorably crafted the ropy length of human viscera that Danny Trejo's character used to grand effect in the original film -- had an even bigger job on Machete Kills.\nWorking with a smaller budget and a shorter schedule, Johns and her assistants found themselved slicing whole bodies in half, crafting William Sadler's severed arm, and providing a veritable bushel of decapitations, exsanguinations, and, who knows, maybe even another defenestration?\n\"I actually worked under KNB as well,\" Johns explains. \"They would ship things over and I'd use their stuff combined with my stuff. It was nice to be able to call them and say, 'Hey, I need a body tomorrow!' That's the way it works, though. The running joke with Robert's movie is 'Have everything ready all the time and then we might use it.' If you don't have it ready, then you're screwed. We had this collection of heads that we'd just travel around with. We were throwing them around and playing catch with them that weekend. That's pretty much a Robert Rodriguez film in a nutshell.\"",

    "text": "The crawling and cruising stage has already been quite long for us, and it looks like it\u2019s staying around for the summer. Sometimes I\u2019ve found it quite hard to think of places to go and just let Tibbs \u2018be\u2019, without facing the challenges of more mobile older children or the usual risky things that babies are drawn to like magnets. They do seem to love a park bench area strewn with fag buts and glass, concrete stairs and revolving doors, don\u2019t they?\nSo, for anyone in the same boat, here\u2019s my favourite places to take a crawling or cruising baby in Bristol. Be warned though \u2013 if you\u2019re a dirty hands and knees phobic, some of these aren\u2019t for you! Also, it goes without saying that most of these are more fun at quiet times, like early mornings and weekdays.\nLook at it! Huge swathes of lovely swooshy floor! Little leather cube seats to pull up on! Small raised stage to aim for! And very, very decent baby friendly food in the cafe in the corner. This is my top pick.\nQuite an obvious one unless you are keen on totally clean or very new to Bristol, but this place is absolutely joyous on a hot day. Watching all the children unable to resist playing in the water is just fab. There\u2019s no reason why on a quiet time a crawling baby can\u2019t watch from the shiny, flat tiled areas, or join in a bit if supervised. Having spent my own hen do there, I\u2019d avoid Saturday afternoons though!\nI know it\u2019s National Trust, and if you\u2019re not a member that means stumping up to enable the baby to stump about, but I promise you, you won\u2019t regret it. An entire day exploring the lovely lawns and gardens, totally dog mess and litter free, with plenty of cows and deer to look at. Can\u2019t go wrong with that. If there\u2019s anywhere to take the visiting Grandparents to show them what junior can do, this is it.\nSurely the ONLY library in the country with a pirate ship in the middle of it, which has multiple cruising functionality. There\u2019s row upon row of books to pull out and throw on the floor (I think you might have to put them back though). There\u2019s friendly staff. And the best bit \u2013 THERE\u2019S A REALLY GOOD RHYMETIME ON A SATURDAY MORNING. Yes, Mums, you can now inflict rhymetime on your partners on a weekend and there\u2019s no excuse not to go!\nThe picture here is of the amazing Book Hive celebrating 400 years of public libraries in Bristol. Also worth cruising down to.\nLush coffee in a beautiful setting for you. Nice large flat space with pull up opportunities on the many ledges and chairs for them. Dogs to pat, really friendly mums to chat to, nice staff and changing facilities too. Ideal. Also cannot be beaten for a \u2018challenging\u2019 buggy walk \u2013 you\u2019ll have buns of steel after two visits.\nLove this post. And the photos are amazing!\nWhat a good list! I can\u2019t even remember where we took T when he was crawling, it all seems like so long ago! Colston Hall does look amazing for toddlers though, and I really need to take a trip back to the central library.\nNo! I had a search and thought it was on for a few months yet. Thanks for letting me know!\nGreat idea! It can be a nightmare on a wet day when you\u2019re desperate to get out. I would add junction 3 library \u2013 it\u2019s free and there\u2019s a slide with a tunnel underneath \u2013 perfect. Check the opening hours first though as they can be a bit odd.",

    "text": "The Progressive Conservatives brought an emergency two hour debate to the floor Wednesday to discuss the current shortage of family doctors and the decision by the new health authority to limit how many doctors can work at walk-in clinics or set up shop in the Halifax area.\nThe McNeil government's promise to provide every family in the province with a doctor has become the major issue of the spring sitting.\nThe opposition brought an emergency two hour debate to the floor to discuss the shortage of family doctors and the decision by the new health authority to limit how many doctors can work at walk-in clinics or set up shop in the Halifax area.\nThe opposition says the decision flies in the face of a key Liberal election promise.\n\"Mister Speaker, when we asked the Speaker about that promise that he made to the people of Nova Scotia that every family would have a doctor,\" said Progressive Conservative Leader Jamie Baillie. \"When we asked him about that promise in their campaign platform he said that that was old information.\"\n\"Well, Mister Speaker, Nova Scotians remember it as a promise made and now it's a promise broken.\"\nEmergency debates are not rare and they don't accomplish anything concrete except to give people a chance to talk about the issue.\nAlfie MacLeod, the PC MLA for Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg, was the man who called for the debate.\n\"We have, according to the minister, 10 new doctors coming to Cape Breton ... that is only to replace 10 doctors that are already gone,\" said MacLeod.\nMacLeod said in a meeting that happened this weekend, local doctors said 15 new physicians were leaving the area.\n\"They put in their resignations and they've been attracted to different jurisdictions. They have said they're going to retire and some have just thrown up their arms and said 'I could practice for a few more years, but you know what, the system is making it so hard I don't want to do that.'\"\nMarian Mancini, MLA for Dartmouth South, said one of her constituents, a young woman in her 30s who moved back to Nova Scotia from Alberta more than two years ago, still can't find a family doctor. Mancini says while the woman is able to go to the walk-in clinic, it's not acceptable.\n\"At the walk-in if she needs to get an x-ray, they'll give her the slip to get the x-ray and then do your follow-up with your family doctor. She doesn't have a family doctor,\" said Mancini.\n\"This is a young person ... wondering whether it's worthwhile staying in this province that she returned to. It's her home province. And she's thinking 'I might as well go back out west because this is not quality of life.'\"\nLiberal backbencher Terry Farrell from Cumberland North said the McNeil government intends to keep its promise to improve the health care system.\n\"Nova Scotians chose that change resoundingly in October of 2013, they voted for that change and they chose that change, he said. \"I'm pleased to say that under the premier and the minister of health, we're in the process of effecting that change. That is happening every single day of our mandate.\"",

    "text": "In Part 2 of their article on the ISE sustainability index in Brazil Paulo D. Branco, Vice Coordinator of Center for Sustainability Studies at FGV EAESP (FGVces) and Aron Belinky, Coordinator of the FGVces Sustainable and Consumption Program and Executive Coordinator of ISE, take a look at the challenges and improvements to make for a brighter, more sustainability-conscious future.\nIn many aspects, setting up ISE \u2013 the Corporate Sustainability Index of the Brazilian stock exchange \u2013 and keeping it running for almost 15 years has been a challenge. Although there were interesting technical obstacles to overcome regarding the scoring methodology, creating the algorithm for the selecting process and the IT system to support the whole thing, the most challenging aspects for us were the negotiation of the questionnaire structure and content, and the commitment of companies and other stakeholders \u2013 all of these being processes that actually happened in close relation with each other. The main obstacles were the skepticism of many actors, and for different reasons. For some, especially NGOs and labor organizations, the risk of greenwashing was far too big, and trust in the selection process wasn\u2019t something that could be taken for granted. For others, such as less engaged or excessively pragmatic market and corporate players, the whole thing seemed to be a time-consuming and focus-dispersing adventure, that could even trigger unnecessary friction with stakeholders that would otherwise remain traditionally immobile. To solve such deadlock, the credibility that FGV and the team was able to gather and harness was essential. In addition, while credibility was indeed very important, the really crucial aspect for success was the transparency and adherence to a clear, open and well-intended process. It was only by this that it was possible to create the essential trust and dialogue required to build a common agenda and the collective deep-rooted process that supports ISE.\nRegarding the impact of ISE, there is unfortunately no formal assessment to show but there is much evidence that it has relevant impact both to companies, at individual level, and to broader society and the market. This includes for instance, the fluctuations in companies\u2019 share values that coincides with their presence or absence in the ISE portfolio, or the actions and words of high level executives and their staff regarding such situations as well as specific aspects of company performance. It is also telling evidence that ISE is frequently mentioned \u2013 by companies, practitioners, academia, media and governmental bodies \u2013 as a reference for the business sustainability agenda.\nTo date, more than 170 companies have participated in the selection process of the ISE, and only about 70 of those have been in its portfolio for at least a year. Moreover, besides the possibility to be part of the ISE\u2019s portfolio, participating in the selection process is in itself an extraordinary opportunity for self-assessment, diagnosis and planning for the overwhelming majority of these companies. Based on the structure of the ISE questionnaire that attempts to evaluate the existence of policies, processes, practices and metrics, participating companies can identify strengths and weakness that help them design and implement a sustainability strategy and an action plan.\nAlthough \u201cethical investment\u201d may be a term used by many, we believe it is not the best term to describe what ISE and other similar indexes are about. \u201cEthical\u201d conveys the idea of a moral judgement of certain sectors and types of business, and while this can be the case of investors such as the pension funds of religious institutions \u2013 indeed, there is nothing wrong with that \u2013 the term cannot apply to many others and, as we see, might constitute a lower potential for mainstreaming and scaling up.\nThis being said, it would be good news if people were able to bring an ethical dimension into their decision-making processes and daily lives. However, there are stronger and less controversial arguments to voice if we look to the terms \u201csustainable investment\u201d or \u201cresponsible\u201d, or \u201cgreen\u201d, or even \u201csocial investment\u201d. The argument here is essentially based on the idea that we are in the throes of a rapid transition to an entirely different business environment triggered by a combination of technological, environmental, cultural and demographic transformations. Companies that have succeeded in the not-so-distant past may not survive in the coming \u2013 and in some ways already present \u2013 environment. For us, this is the emerging profile of sustainable investment: not just looking at companies that do good, but rather trying to sort out those who are catching up with the transition \u2013 and thus contributing to a fairer and more sustainable world \u2013 and those who are lagging behind, unable or unwilling to update their businesses; or, additionally, those who are too attached to their past and current assets and advantages, regardless of how incompatible with the new environment they might be.\nDivestment from carbon-intensive portfolios, getting rid of stranded assets and searching for innovative positive-impacting emerging businesses are clear signs of how investors are reacting to this situation. That\u2019s why, far from a passing fashion, we trust we are talking about a near and brighter future.",

Johnson's work stood out from the other applicants in her innovative approach to video art. Her works demonstrate a meticulous process of research combined with smart narrative lines. I was particularly impressed as well by her eye for the installation and display of her video works, often placing the screens on the floor or at unconventional levels, which further emphasize the landscapes and stories told in her works. I'm excited for the future of Johnson's art practice and look forward to seeing her exhibition at the Center for Maine Contemporary Art.\"\nMarcela Guerrero is Assistant Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, where she recently curated the exhibition Pacha, Llaqta, Wasichay: Indigenous Space, Modern Architecture, July 13\u2014September 30, 2018.

Along with Fajardo-Hill, Guerrero curated the show\u2019s selection of Latina and Chicana artists and has written the catalogue chapter on Caribbean women artists, along with more than sixty biographical entries.

    "text": "The controversial $3 billion corporate tax initiative Measure 97 went down in defeat, according to partial election returns Tuesday night.\nMeasure 97 was failing 58 percent to 42 percent as of 9:50 p.m.\nSupporters of Measure 97 were still figuring out how to respond Tuesday night. Ben Unger, executive director of the union-affiliated group Our Oregon which backed the measure, suggested a different tax proposal might have fared better with voters. \"Clearly, we learned the tonight that the details weren't right,\" Unger said. However, when a reporter asked if the tax rate proposed in Measure 97 was too high, Unger said \"I would be surprised if you talked to very many voters that found that that was the problem.\"\nPat McCormick, a spokesman for the campaign to defeat the tax, said Measure 97 \"fell of its own weight when people understood what it would do\" and now it's up to state officials to come up with proposals to balance the state budget. \"The business community does have members that are very much committed to finding routes to go forward,\" McCormick said.\nState economists in the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office estimated the tax would raise at least $6 billion for every two-year spending cycle, a 33 percent increase in tax revenue going to the state's current $18 billion general fund budget. That would have been the largest tax increase in Oregon's history, at least by dollar amount, according to Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner.\nThose potential tax hits -- and the promise of new revenue for government services -- spurred businesses and public employee unions to the highest level of campaign spending in Oregon history.\nAs of Friday, opponents reported raising $25.9 million, while supporters reported $16.4 million. The previous record for the costliest Oregon campaign was set in 2014, when opponents of a measure to label genetically modified foods spent nearly $21 million with supporters spending $8 million.\nMeasure 97 started out with 60 percent support in a poll taken a year ago. A poll in September found the same level of support. But by mid-October it had eroded down to 46 percent and by the end of the month only 40 percent of respondents to one poll said they'd vote for it.\nThe central debate throughout the campaign was whether corporations or consumers would end up paying the cost of the tax -- and how much.\nA study by economists in the Legislative Revenue Office found businesses would pass on part of the tax in the form of higher prices, and a typical Oregon family might wind up paying $600 a year. Grocery stores and other low-margin businesses said they would be forced to raise prices, because the 2.5 percent tax would obliterate their slim profit margins.\nSupporters of the measure said no economic modeling -- including in a study they funded, by Portland State University economists -- could accurately estimate the impact of the measure.\nThe backers argued it was too different from gross receipts taxes in other states. And they offered state-by-state shopping comparisons to show that different tax rates didn't result in different prices.\nBut Measure 97 opponents also pointed to a written opinion from a lawyer for the Legislature that said lawmakers could spend the revenue as they wanted simply by passing budget bills, despite language in the measure calling for the money to be spent on early childhood and K-12 education, health care and services for seniors.\nGov. Kate Brown, lawmakers, public employee unions and the business community now face the challenge of coming together after the bruising battle to address the state's ongoing challenges.\nVoters' rejection of Measure 97 means the governor and lawmakers must now pass a tax increase, budget cuts or some combination to fill a projected $1.35 billion budget shortfall in the next two-year budget. That estimate was based on the amount of money needed to preserve existing services and programs.",

It was a joyful event to the people from Bongweni and Kokstad Diocese at large. The Holy Mass began at 9h.00 in the morning.\nIn his homily, the Bishop explained to the faithful the meaning of the ministry for which the candidate had to be laid hands; \u201cDiaconia\u201d which is all about service. He also reminded the candidate to befriend Jesus, who came to the world to serve and not to be served. He also mentioned that to make God one\u2019s friend is something very important that a person can do because it draws one closer to the path of holiness. He therefore invited the candidate to befriend God if he wants to be a holy man.\nIn the same regard, he urged the candidate to be a good leader. As a leader, he should firstly accept to be led by Jesus Christ, a humble and faithful servant of God. He has to follow His footsteps and lead in His manner. \u201cIf we fail to lead in manner of Jesus, we run a greater risk of misleading the people of God.\u201d The Bishop said. He added that as leaders, our primarily role is to direct people to God.\nAdd to this he reminded everybody that a leader should be a faithful, humble, patient, peaceful and prayerful person. He should do everything for the greater glory of God.\nBy freely accepting the ministry of diaconate, the Bishop encouraged the new candidate to be a man of God by reminding him that the vow of celibacy he will be taking should help him to live a life of chastity and dedicate himself totally to God and serve Him through His people with all his heart. \u201cOnce you do things in this manner, the Lord will say to you at the end of your pilgrimage on earth: good servant come to me and enter into your father\u2019s Kingdom\u201d he said.\nHis Excellency Peter Wells, the Apostolic Nuncio to South Africa visited the Diocese of Kokstad from 22-26 November 2017. Among other things he visited different deaneries of the Diocese celebrating Holy Mass with the Christian faithful.\n\u201d Bishop Zolile P. Mpambani celebrated Chrism Mass in Matatiele Deanery. It was a day of joy. The Holy Mass started at 10h.00 in the morning with a big crowd around their shepherd\u201d.\nOn the 19th February a big crowd of faithful and invitees gathered in Kokstad for celebrating Bishop Zolile P. Mpambani\u2019s 60th Year Birthday as well as his 30th Anniversary of his Priestly ordination.\nThe Holy Mass was said for the two-fold celebration held at the St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Kokstad at 11h.00am. The readings were taken from the 7th Sunday of the Year A. In his homily during the Eucharistic Celebration, Bishop Jwarha of the Vicariate of Ingwavuma called all the faithful and those who were present to understand that Jesus has given us a new law. This is the law of love. Therefore hatred belongs to the past.\n\u201c \u2026I hope you understand that hatred belongs to the past. Jesus said I give you a new law. This is the Law of love.\u201d He said. He also reminded the faithful that, we should not hate those who make us suffer, but pray for them and do well to those who persecute us. There is nobody who may say that he/she does not have an enemy. And if somebody does not have an enemy that means there is something wrong with that person. But we should go and love our neighbour and greet them. We should not retaliate with hatred or wrong doing. If we only greet those who love us that means we are not yet true followers of Jesus. We should not live in the past with hatred. We are the temple of God and the Holy Spirit dwells in us. Therefore hatred can make a mess of this temple. To hate another person is to put shame on ourselves.\nHe also brought to Bishop\u2019s Zolile\u2019s attention that as the Gospel of the day speaks about enemies, he (Bishop of Kokstad) also in all these 60th years of priestly ministry may have experienced it in his life. He also added that to have enemies is not a synonym of being a bad person. Some enemies come to our lives without our invitations. There are some who come to our lives because of what we have; there are others we have in our lives simply because they do not want to hear the truth. A person may also be hated because of his/her righteousness.\nIt is painful for a faithful to be an enemy of another faithful. We cannot say at the time of our baptism that we reject Satan yet after baptism we still carrying on developing hatred and become enemies of our fellow Christians. In the same regard it is painful to be hated by a faithful who know God who may happen to be a prayerful person.\nWe cannot receive the body of Christ, calling ourselves Christians and yet still living the past and still want to revenge or hate our fellow brothers and sisters. He also reminded the Bishop that the work God gave him is not as easy task but he should only persevere in prayer and ask God to help him not to be any person\u2019s enemy.\nHe also put it clearly in front of everybody that it is a shame when people have to hate one another in the Catholic Church. How can I hate my brother or sister and yet I approach the table of the Lord to receive the Holy Communion? Before doing so we should firstly encounter the Lord in sacrament of reconciliation. This will therefore help us to love our neighbour, our brothers and sisters and pray for those who hate us. And the Scriptures remind us that it is better to forgive before the sunset. One of the reasons we should regularly visit the sacrament of reconciliation is because we cannot eat the body of Christ with anger and hatred in us.\nAddressing the parents, teachers and the crowd at the graduation ceremony of the children in the Holy Trinity Hall in Matatiele, Bishop Zolile P. Mpambani reminded them of their duty to their children. \u201cAs parents our primary responsibility should be to help our children to know, serve, respect and fear God all the time.\u201d He said. He also reminded all the parents that the future of their children depend on the present. \u2018Since there is no parent who would wish to have a failure child in the future, it is therefore our duty as parents together with the teachers to help the children in shaping their future because their \u2018tomorrow\u2019 will necessarily depends on how they will be treated and brought up\u2019 he mentioned. In addition, \u2018as parents we are invited to help the children to have a bright future\u2019 he said. The Bishop also urged the parents to love their children as Jesus does. Jesus loves the children so very much and that is the reason why he said \u201c\u2026let the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the Kingdom of God belongs\u201d \u2018 but if we also look like children ours will be the Kingdom of God too\u2019 he said.",

All his sculpts instil charm and personality.\nMy first choice was the Ambull, a dangerous creature native from the rock deserts of Luther McIntyre IX. They can be found on extreme temperatures planets, excavating tunnels for their lairs in the rock.\nFor the fleshy parts I used beiges instead, so it all kept a colour coherence but you could still see the differences.\nThough I've seen it (the GW original version) painted with some other flashy colours, I rather went on this path, more earthy; it somehow felt right once I begun to paint it.\nSo this is it, a nice addition to my RT bestiary and a cool concept for scenarios in tunnels or labyrinths.\nGreat job Suber, can't wait to get my hands on mine now ! I'm looking forward to the other models you might have grabbed !\nThank you! All the models are lovely, I got the full batch, so I have some work to do!\nExcellent. I've been neglecting my RT stuff and didn't even know about this one. Rats.\nThen you most certainly must do something about that! :D There are some pretty nice models awaiting for some love!\nNice work - the muted colours look good.\nThank you! The mini is sweet and easy to paint, go for it!!\nHe looks great in the desert color/earthy scheme.\nThanks! Stomping into one of these after a long day in the desert for sure won't be that nice!",

    "text": "People comment all the time that doctors are \u201cterrible\u201d\u2026 whenever two, or more\u2026 get together, they seem not to know how to speak about anything else but work.\nWell, may be it is true, but\u2026 the truth, the real truth is that I do not understand why people consider it to be surprising. The reason I do not understand is because, beyond all possible doubts, health is the number one conversation subject for\u2026 everyone!\nLet us take a little time to consider this idea seriously!\nRemember the last time you went to the hairdresser (or to the barber\u2026) or when queueing at a public office, the coffe shop, the beach, or at the cinema interval\u2026 Tell me, was \u201csomeone\u201d not always there telling \u201csomeone else\u201d all about a list of diseases that this person had been suffering from for the last ten years of their lives (at least\u2026) and at the same time the other someone is trying to bring up all their possible ailments, in a way they would not feel they were less than the other person.\nWell, if there is nothing really relevant in their own medical past and present, there will certainly be someone in the family or closest friends that they remember having already had a disease, or an operation, or \u201csomething\u201d worth speaking of, so that they are not left behind without a subject to follow the conversation.\nHealth is indeed the most important thing in our lives.\nThat is what doctors do, maintain health, improve health.\nThey deal with the most precisous \u201cthing\u201d for humanity. They have the power to intervene, change, improve your health\u2026 hopefully.\nTo speak frankly, doctors have the capacity to interfere with life, everybody\u2019s life.\nIt is not easy. It is hard, almost superhuman to take decisions when interfering with life.\nMay be it is because there are very difficult decisions they have to take, that doctors like to exchange ideas, experiences, whenever they have a chance. Because diseases are in the books but the patients are not, patients are unique, each one \u201cinterprets\u201d and reacts to the same disease in a different way, each one does it their own way. That is why the \u201croad\u201d that patients and doctors have to drive down together, to achieve their ultimate goal, health, is full of non signalised bumps and holes, tricky curbs an sliding pavements.\nAs unity is strength, the doctor/patient team has to be close, united and with a strong cumplicity.\nIt is essential to assess the risks and benefits of every decision never forgeting that there are some patients that we will not be able to help but there are none that we can not possibly harm.\nMedicine besides being a science is also an art and a lot of sensibility, intuition and heart are needed in order to take decisions that will turn science more human, more adjusted to each patient\u2019s reallity and that will help them to live life the best way possible\u2026 their own way.\nPrescribing medicines is a very relevant part of all the decisions that have to be taken and for that it is important to really know well the one they are being given to.\nThe word \u201cdoctor\u201d is derived from the Latin \u201cdocere,\u201d which means \u201cto teach.\u201d We must do this daily as we deliver care to our patients. But, as we do it, we are learning as well. We are learning how to know, how to catch the \u201cfeeling\u201d of a person, we are learning from the patient how to personalise care. The patient must not hide anything from the one they seek help from and there has to be, above all, trust and belief in the guidance they are offered, but never blind trust or dogmatic irrational belief. In some situations second opinions are mandatory and should be offered by your own health care provider.\nIt is usually said that \u201ctwo heads think better than one\u201d\u2026and I would like to add\u2026 if they think together, with open, cooperative minds. Several heads thinking separately only create confusion, and endanger the outcome of treatment. That is why shopping around for health is dangerous. The choice has to be grounded on facts, knowledge and experience, and\u2026 your own \u201ctaste\u201d. Like when choosing the boutique that offers you that special line of fashion that suits your body\u2026 and mind! As you keep returning, they will have the feeling of what you need and what fits you, making everything easier.\nWhen your health care team knows you well enough they can offer you an adequate, personalised and balanced view of therapeutic benefits and harms and more realistic explanations of what treatments they have to offer, generating more active and trusting relationships.\nThen, hopefully, things will turn out well.",

This is a lot of what I do with the college students I see.\nIs this someone who can take critical feedback? Thanks to: John Jonas of Onlinejobs.PH. This line is part of every template for every job ad ever written. This line is in the ad to stop time wasters and people that don\u2019t have the killer instinct to see past the obstacle that\u2019s been laid in front of them. If you give up on your career dream just because of one line, in one job ad, you\u2019re probably not cut out to work for most companies.\nMyBlog Richard Brosnon Says: Thanks to: Stephanie Dalfonzo of Your Power Breakthrough. Another interesting piece of research comes from the Angela Lee Duckworth\u2019s study on grit. Duckworth measured factors such as SAT scores, IQ tests, and overall capabilities and skill levels of different candidates and concluded that the foremost factor that determined success over failure was grit \u2013 the ability to switch from a fixed mindset to one of growth, pushing and persevering beyond what was previously considered impossible.\nIf all you do is bask in the comfort of those activities and people that you know well, you\u2019ll never go to new heights. Success is partly about exploring the unknown. It\u2019s by doing the stuff that you never thought was possible that you discover yourself and ultimately achieve some incredible goals.\n9. Right Thinking for Success Learn almost overnight how to use the millionaire mindset strategy to create the life you want, increase your influence, and grow your income.* 3.

The business comes before your personal preferences.\nWatch Again Concepts of abundance and \u201cthink-to-create\u201d have their usefulness, but are fundamentally dangerous because they hide the critical issue nobody wants to hear: success is hard work.\nMake removing bricks a daily ritual so that it becomes an automatic habit that you follow as part of your regularly scheduled activities. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to engage in the struggle of deciding each and every day if you really want to remove bricks when you\u2019re tired or tempted to do something else. Grow your confidence by establishing a time every day to remove bricks from the wall that\u2019s standing between you and whatever it is you want.\nHere\u2019s why the critics are bagging personal development: No matter what, you and only you are responsible for all your deeds and its outcome. Nothing less, nothing more. You can\u2019t change your fate looking externally, you need to take all the responsibility of your life and use it to your fullest capabilities and make it a life well lived.\nOkay, you know the drill \u2014 let\u2019s break them down. No matter how old you are, if you don\u2019t know what you want by now, don\u2019t be angry. Choose action over anger. Go out there and try lots of stuff. Give a speech, travel the world, start a blog, write one chapter of a book, make some art, build a shed, learn salsa dancing.",

    "text": "Since I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006 at age 55, I have been fortunate to have had some wonderful resources available to help me through my journey with the disease. My husband, Paul, continues to be an enormous supporter in every sense of the word: his wit, wisdom, strength, love and courage have sustained me, and he has always been there for me both as a caregiver and my best friend.\nThe Pancreatic Cancer Action Network also served as a tremendous source of support for me. Soon after my diagnosis, I learned about the organization. Through it, I have met many doctors, researchers and dedicated volunteers that opened up a whole new world to me, and I treasure the new friendships I have developed with all of these wonderful people. I was very proud to receive the ?pirit of Hope?award when it was presented to me at the Evening With the Stars gala in October of 2007. I also derived great satisfaction from participating in Advocacy Day in 2006, when I joined 160 volunteers from all over the United States in Washington, D.C. in lobbying our elected officials. How gratifying to learn that just two years later nearly 500 volunteers joined the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network? lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill.\nI really have been blessed with a rich and fulfilling life. I was the fourth generation in my family to be born in Los Angeles, and have always returned to Southern California after moving away.\nFor a time in the early 70s, I moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where I launched a career in advertising, and started my own food condiment business.\nAs my career in advertising flourished, I began working with major publications including Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and USNews and World Report. I also worked in a managerial position with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. In addition, I co-owned a commercial design firm, sold residential real estate, invested in a fine art gallery specializing in modern and contemporary masters, and worked for a period with Fortune 500 company executives on honing their communication skills.\nMy personal life has been gratifying, as well. I was married to my first husband, Michael McNeill, for 17 years and helped raise his kids, who were ages five and eight when we began our life together. I loved my role as a parent, and to this day, children? causes hold a special place in my heart. In addition to delivering meals to the homeless, I read to children living in shelters at night, paint school classrooms, and help raise funds for programs working to bring an end to school bullying.\nI also feel strongly about furthering preventative health, wellness and nutrition causes. I was one of the founding board members of the Aspen Center for Integral Health. I also volunteer with The Colleagues in Los Angeles and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\nIn addition to supporting my charitable causes, I enjoy an active lifestyle. Living on the beach in Hawaii fostered my love of running. I also swim, hike and ride in 100-mile bike races and ski whenever I can. Paul and I divide our time between Los Angeles and Aspen, so the climates in these cities are ideal for engaging in all of these activities.\nLiving with pancreatic cancer has taught we some valuable lessons. I have learned that when difficult and bad things happen to you, you get to decide what they mean for you. I have strived to meet these challenges with passion, compassion, humor, style, generosity and kindness.",

However Dr. Robert C. Allen, Professor of Economic History at Oxford University, in his column (http://www.voxeu.org/article/why-was-industrial-revolution-british/) introducing his book \"The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective\" pointed out the factor of the low energy cost situation due to the exploitation of coal. In spite of Britain's globalisation approach, the industiral revolution in the other countries were not as effective due to economical situations. In other words they face the barrier of having a higher energy cost.\nEnMS-Doc is coordinating the mission, organised by Japan Business Publishing Co., Ltd. and The Graduate School of Project Design, is seeking companies willing to do business in Japan with partnership arrangement in the field of sustainability, and willing to take advantage of this mission coming to London area.\nJapan is struggling to identify what will be the next step in the field of sustainability. One reason is that there is no direct Japanese translation of the word \"sustainability\". The other is in terms of the business related to energy management, Japan needs to make more effort to harmonise with the rest of the world.\nAs a first step to counter these issues, \"Japanese Sustainability Business Discovery Mission to the U.K.\" was organised supported by UKTI Japan/British Embassy Tokyo seeking potential partners willing to do business in Japan with their new ideas, technology, products, services, etc. in the field of sustainability.\nIt will be approximately 20-company mission, leaders in sustainability business in Japan with diverse range of business types such as energy solution provider, IT implementer, building facility management, IT and control company, BEMS-aggregator player , ESCO player, etc., aiming to get acquaintance with companies interested to explore business in Japan. Our immediate aim is together with UKTI to identify business units interested to explore Japanese market by forming partnership with Japanese companies pursuing sustainability business development.\nAny individual or company considering this mission as an opportunity, how about a rendezvous.\nThere will be several options to meet the mission however the major event will be the \"Sustainability Day\" at The University of London on Monday 5th November, an open forum aiming for the mission members to meet and exchange ideas with partner potentials. Kindly please contact us if you are interested or your recommendations to identify companies who may wish to meet the mission. \"Meet the Mission Invitation Package\" for download.\nThe \"BEMS-Aggregator\", a 30 billion yen (GBP 240 million) project, is to ensure better energy performing 20,000 small/medium buildings (less than 500kW contract) and 10,000 model homes by promoting installation of BEMS (HEMS for homes) and to appoint aggregators to measure the improvement on behalf of METI.\nThere are 23 designated \"BEMS-Aggregator\" companies, and with their consortium partners, there are 77 player companies (Download list of aggregators and consortium companies). The project has officially started on 17 April this year. For the intended delegation, the members will be most likely from those 77 companies.\nPlease contact Nobby yamanouchi (nobby@enms-doc.com) if you have any further question.\nWe are organizing together with our EnMS partner in Malaysia, EeSolution Engineering view company profile page , a 3-day workshop to make the participating organisation to become competent to self-declare ISO 50001.\nTo gain knowledge of how to measure and quantitatively verify the saving results using proven regression analysis tool.\nParticipants gaining competency level to lead their organisation to implement EnMS operation good enough to self-declare ISO 50001, International Energy Management Standard.\norganisation when they return from the 3-day sessions.",

The university's College of Education Behavioral Research and Testing (BRT) group has signed with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's scoring and assessment imprint, Riverside, as the exclusive distributor of easyCBM.\neasyCBM is a computer-administered application that helps users monitor progress of students based on specific assignments. Specifically, the program provides reporting on student performance and trends in real time to help teachers sort out where each child needs a boost in instruction. Developed in 2006, the latest version of this response to intervention program covers K-8 reading and mathematics for district wide implementation.\nA \"lite\" version free to individual teachers is still available from the research group. According to BRT, the free version will be \"streamlined with nine alternate forms per measure type.\" This edition will be suitable for the teacher to monitor the progress of a group of students.\nThe group stated in a frequently-asked-questions document on its website that the partnership was necessary because \"the incredible success of easyCBM simply far exceeded BRT\u2019s capacity to support it.\" Riverside's hosting will include a toll-free support number and regional representatives who can help customers deploy the program and train users.\nAccording to a statement from the company, 6.5 million easyCBM tests are being given each year, and 163,000 teachers use the data for their instruction. easyCBM is an approved tool by the National Center for Response to Intervention, an organization funded by the US Department of Education to provide technical assistance to states and districts in improving student learning.\n\"With [Houghton Mifflin Harcourt] serving as the exclusive distributor of easyCBM, teachers across the nation now have available a learning management system to use in their classrooms and schools,\" said Gerald Tindal, director of BRT. \"It allows teachers and administrators to build effective programs and collaborate with each other using student performance and progress.\"\nMore information is available at easycbm.com.",

    "text": "Promote market readiness. Many agencies are incorporating market literacy and market readiness training into their programming with very poor populations. Practical Action, for instance, worked with male and particularly female hibiscus farmers in Southern Sudan to better engage with market opportunities. It recognized that in order to improve weak market relationships, significant capacity building and organization was required of isolated producers who lacked common membership organizations, effective risk mitigation strategies, and awareness of what services were available and how to access them. Activities to strengthen market readiness included the development of village development committees, which represented small groups of producers and facilitated their training. These committees were strengthened so as to legitimately represent even very poor farmers, and particularly women, who despite their role in the value chain were often excluded from decision making. Once organized, extensive exposure visits and training on negotiation skills and marketing helped the committees to engage with other market actors in a way that increased benefits for all market actors.\nSupport cross-cutting value chains. Another promising approach is to support access to cross-cutting value chains. Certain products and services, such as transport, packaging, irrigation technologies or agricultural inputs, support diversification and enhance choice because they can be broadly applied. CARE Zimbabwe, for instance, has supported small rural retailers of grocery products to become trained agro-dealers linked to regional wholesalers with finance accounts. The closer availability of inputs has improved access to inputs by farmers who only require a very small quantity and cannot afford the costs of travelling to larger provincial centers. Such approaches empower the poor by turning them into consumers rather than passive recipients of charity.\nPromote local labor sharing. An innovative approach currently being tested is to support small, informal labor groups within communities. Building on the informal groups that exist in many parts of rural Africa, these groups may help to support engagement in value chain activities by providing the labor and motivation to engage in larger projects that are unfeasible for individuals. Save the Children in Mozambique is using such an approach with 'ajuda mutua' (mutual help) groups. Participants report that their participation has resulted in greater food production, diversification of activities, the accomplishment of tasks that were previously not possible without a hired labor force, and the development of stronger bonds with neighbors that can be leveraged in times of need.\nUse community-managed microfinance methodologies. Upgrading trajectories that rely on self-financing will reduce risk levels and increase the ability of very poor populations to participate. Community-managed microfinance is oriented to facilitating the secure mobilization of people's own capital, particularly for those that are unable to access formal financial services. The figure below illustrates the capacity of community-managed microfinance to reach populations who are not served by formal institutions such as banks and microfinance institutions. For very poor populations, savings groups are often first used as a vehicle for income smoothing, and subsequently, as amounts grow, for small investments. Debt financing is better used as a subsequent intervention once very poor populations have developed their own capital and have more capacity to handle debt.\nCatholic Relief Services (CRS) in Tanzania used this approach by encouraging chick pea farmers to first form small savings groups. These groups accumulated small amounts of capital that was then lent out among group members. Once these groups were well functioning, they were used as platforms for negotiating group sales contracts directly with exporters for higher prices and better terms. A case study of this project found that in comparison with conventional marketing groups that had been created by other NGOs, CRS\u2019s strategy of integrating group asset mobilization into the marketing structure created greater group cohesion. It also increased the participation of poor community members, who had traditionally not participated in joint marketing structures given a need for immediately cash at harvest and an inability to delay sale to access better prices.\nEncourage co-investment or co-financing with other value chain actors. Africare and Cardno\u2019s Community-based Orphan Protection and Empowerment project cultivated linkages between lead firms and caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children across several East African countries. In Uganda, an exporter of dried fruit was willing to sign an MOU to purchase dried fruit for export from caregivers and older orphans and vulnerable children. By establishing and strengthening horizontal linkages through production groups, the caregivers were able to aggregate sufficient volumes to supply the buyer. Critically, this lead firm was willing to invest in its relationship with the groups by constructing and contributing to the cost of solar dryers. Ongoing follow-up and support are now being provided by the lead firm.\nSupport greater and better quality employment opportunities. Relative to self-employment, many vulnerable populations prefer the security, networking and other benefits of steady employment. In many cases, the decision to pursue self-employment is taken due to a lack of other options. Generating employment opportunities can therefore be an effective strategy for value chain initiatives to incorporate very poor populations. ACDI/VOCA\u2019s GMED project in India, for instance, focused on developing opportunities for the marginalized within the solid waste management sector. Whereas engagement in this sector has traditionally attracted harassment and violence, particularly for women, it also provides an easy point of entry for the poorly educated urban poor. The GMED project worked with several municipalities in India to improve the performance and status of the sector by outsourcing to small enterprises. As a consequence, workers previously engaged in the informal sector are now receiving higher wages with greater job security and higher social status. Many of the project clients are also more empowered following the transition.\nUse smart subsidies to buy down risk. It is recognized that the limited subsidies can be an effective tool to reduce the risk of adopting new behaviors or making unproven investments. This is particularly true when working with very poor populations, for whom upgrading may require unacceptably high levels of risk. The Mennonite Economic Development Associates (MEDA) faced strong adversion among farmers, wholesalers and retailers in Zambia to invest in a demonstrably profitable technology: manual water pumps for irrigation. Suppliers did not see a market among smallholders for the equipment and consequently were unwilling to invest in expanding their supply chains and building market demand. Conversely, very poor farmers would not invest in irrigation technologies given the cost and unproven returns. MEDA used a time-bound voucher to subsidize a portion of the cost of purchasing a new water pump from local retailers. Early signs indicate that both farmers and suppliers are beginning to recognize and respond to the potential of the technologies.\nSequence economic strengthening activities by level of vulnerability. Reflecting the need to build capacity to cope with adversity prior to generating new income opportunities, Family Health International's Regional Outreach Addressing HIV/AIDS through Development Strategies (ROADS) project, that includes economic development partner DAI, has developed a model that has four stages of economic strengthening, as illustrated below. Three of these (savings mobilization, business training, and market access) are available to participants sequentially. Once resilience is built through savings protection and mobilization, community participants are then supported to improve the performance of their microenterprises within existing markets. Focusing on current\u2014usually local\u2014markets is a risk-reduction strategy for vulnerable clients. As microentrepreneurs improve their skills and management capacity, they are assisted to identify and access higher potential markets. Recognizing the food security challenges confronting project participants, technical assistance is provided to savings group members and business training recipients to bolster the productivity of farm plots and kitchen gardens. Importantly, participants self-select their continued participation in the project based upon interest, capacity and other factors. ROADS anticipates variable individual and community progress and interest in upgrading and therefore will provide tailored trainings to groups based on the speed of their progress rather than project timeframes.\nImprove food security. Food insecurity is a strong contributor to risk aversion. Households that face chronic or seasonal food shortages are often unwilling to make longer-term investments that they will need to liquidate in lean periods. Strategies to increase the food security of vulnerable populations are presented here.\nIdentify inefficiencies and market opportunities for social product and service value chains. As with other value chains, applying value chain analysis to social products and services facilitates the identification of constraints and opportunities. Unlike other approaches to benefiting very poor populations, however, the goal of the analysis is not to improve income but rather to improve access to social products and services. Action for Enterprise, for instance, conducted a value chain analysis in Bangladesh of several important health products with limited outreach to vulnerable populations and potential beneficial impacts. The study identified how existing firms could improve outreach of these products, and assessed the impacts of the enabling environment in shaping private sector behavior and incentives.\nDevelop alternative delivery mechanisms. Existing delivery channels for social products and services commonly fail to reach very poor populations, who are not prioritized by public service providers given remoteness, low purchasing power, weak political power and other factors. Some agencies have found that improving supply systems for basic services can create powerful impacts upon the capacity of the poor to become or remain economically active. The Mennonite Economic Development Associates (MEDA), for instance, applied the value chain approach to improve the efficiency of malaria net distributions in Tanzania. Mosquito nets that reduce the likelihood of malaria infection had traditionally been provided only through public clinics, with limited outreach and usage levels. MEDA implemented a voucher scheme that was redeemable at private-sector outlets. The voucher mechanism created a rapid response by private entrepreneurs to stock nets even in extremely remote villages that had never before been serviced. The project found that not only were health incomes improved - the total number of people owning a net, for instance, increased from 44% to 66% from 2005 to 2007 - but also that there were substantial economic impacts.\n\u2191 S.

    "text": "Typerbole: Jaguar has used \u201ceverything we know about precision engineering, performance and design\u201d to create its mightiest F-Type yet.\nJAGUAR will give Australian fans that missed out on the ultra-exclusive F-Type Project 7 a second chance to experience the ultimate in F-Type performance, with the first series production Jaguar to emerge from its SVR skunkworks coming Down Under in the third quarter of 2016.\nAvailable as either Convertible or Coupe, the F-Type SVR will introduce a \u201clighter, faster and more powerful\u201d variant of the two-seater Jag, positioned above the current F-Type R flagship, with a dizzying maximum speed of 322km/h.\nLittle information and only a handful of images have been released ahead of the SVR's official public debut at the Geneva motor show in early March, but Jaguar Land Rover special operations manager John Edwards has hinted at its potency.\n\u201cThe result is a 200mph, all-weather supercar that you can drive every day \u2013 we even made a Convertible version so that enthusiasts can revel in the sound from the new titanium exhaust system,\u201d he said.\nWith that capability, the SVR smashes the F-Type R's top end by 22km/h, suggesting it has significantly more poke than the 'standard' 404kW 5.0-litre supercharged V8, and could even trump the Project 7 power, which also tops out at 300km/h.\nJust 10 of the 250 strictly limited Project 7s came to Australia, but Jaguar Land Rover Australia senior public affairs executive James Scrimshaw told GoAuto that the new F-Type range-topper would not be built in such limited numbers.\n\u201cFrom day one with Project 7, they were only going to make so many cars, but this will be an ongoing model like Range Rover Sport SVR,\u201d he said.\nMr Scrimshaw explained that exact local timing, pricing and specification were still being finalised, and that availability here would be dictated by global demand.\n\u201cEvery single market, no matter what car company around the world works on a market equation based on what each market delivers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same will be for us.\n\u201cIt all depends on supply and demand around the world so that question is too early to answer. Until it goes round the motor shows and people put in their global requests, that's when they can work out how many they can make.\nBut with increasing demand for both the Jaguar and Land Rover brands in Australia, Mr Scrimshaw said JLR is gaining bartering power for global supply.\n\u201cWith Land Rover we are one of the top 10 markets in the world, so we do have a lot more sway than we ever did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe combined JLR business is around 13,000 units a year but we were around 4000 to 5000 five years ago, so the growth is huge.\nDespite the SVR's supercar performance, Jaguar says it \u201cretains its day-to-day usability\u201d with the same \u201ccomfort and duality of character inherent to all jaguar cars,\u201d according to the company.\nThe British car-maker originally had planned to reveal the F-Type SVR in a surprise Geneva show unveiling, but had decided to issue a handful of official images and statement, following leaked images and information from brochures printed in preparation for the launch.",

This is because people mostly know about the main planets or names like the Mars, Jupiter or the planet Earth but know nothing about others at all. Therefore, all those people who want to know of these planets with basic and brief information that is also interesting, then this article is the best way for you to know about the planet Mercury.\nMercury is the smallest-ever planet known in all of the Solar System while it also has a rotation period which is also the smallest in all because it is about just 88 days of the planet Earth. When it comes to moving around in its orbit then it is said to do so in over 116 days.\nMercury has an average speed of 47.362 kilometres per second while the orbital period is equivalent to half Mercury solar day. The Mercurys mass is 3.3011 x 10^23 kilogrammes while the volume and size are 6.083 x10^10 kilometres and 7.48 x 10^7 kilometre squares respectively.\nEvidently, this planet is named after the Roman deity called Mercury who was the messenger of the Gods while it has a surface temperature that is more than any other planet due to the absence of any atmosphere to retain heat. The day times have temperatures ranging from 100K while the polar areas have 180K there. On the other hand, when it comes to the orbit\u2019s eccentricity then it is the largest among all while it looks heavily cratered just like the Moon.\nThis also means that this planet has also been inactive for many years now. For every two revolutions around the Sun, this planet revolves or rotates on its axis exactly three times. This also means that any observer will only see one day every couple of year when he is on Mercury.\nTill 1965, it was thought that the same side of this planet kept facing the Sun all the time.\n176 Earth days combine together to make just one day on the plants surface.\nHence, you are now truly well aware of the brief needed information about this planet very well now!",

    "text": "Debutant Andrew Tye registered the second hat-trick of the day as a clinical Gujarat Lions defeated Rising Pune Supergiant by seven wickets to notch up their first win in the ongoing Indian Premier League, here today.\nOpting to bowl first, right-arm pacer Tye, playing his first IPL match, returned with impressive figures of 5 for 17 from his four overs to enable Gujarat Lions restrict Supergiant to 171 for eight.\nTye's was the second hat-trick of the day in the history of IPL after Royal Challengers Bangalore's Samuel Badree (4/9) achieved the feat earlier against Mumbai Indians in a losing cause.\nTye was instrumental in keeping the Supergiant's total under check, especially after a blazing start by opener Rahul Tripathi (33 off 17) and skipper Steven Smith (43 off 28).\nLater chasing the target, Brendon McCullum (49 off 32) and Dwayne Smith (47 off 30) got Gujarat Lions off to a flier with a blazing 94-run opening stand to set the base for the convincing victory.\nSkipper Suresh Raina (35 not out) and Aaron Finch (33 not out) then joined hands and stitched an unbeaten 61-run fourth wicket stand to overwhelm the target with two overs to spare.\nFinch finished off the proceedings in great style, clobbering Lockie Ferguson for two huge hits over the fence to get Gujarat Lions' campaign back on track after defeats in the opening two matches.\nChasing the challenging total, Gujarat Lions got off to a blazing start with McCullum and Dwayne Smith sharing qucikfire 94 runs for the opening stand in just 53 balls.\nBoth McCullum and Dwayne Smith looked in murderous mood as they mostly dealt fours and sixes. The duo didn't spare a single Supergiant bowler as they effortlessly struck boundaries and sixes.\nSupergiant finally manged to put some brakes on the Gujarat Lions' scoring rate when Shardul Thakur dismissed Dwayne Smith in the ninth over, caught at third man by Rahul Chahar.\nDwayne Smith scored his runs off 30 balls with the help of eight boundaries and one six.\nThe fall of Dwayne Smith's wicket resulted in another two overs later when a charging McCullum was stumped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni off leg-spinner Chahar's bowling.\nNew man in Dinesh Karthik too didn't last long as he chopped on Imran Tahir's googly on to his stumps in the next over.\nEarlier electing to bowl, Gujarat Lions got off to a prefect start as veteran Praveen Kumar (1/51) removed dangerous Ajinkya Rahane for a duck with the third ball of the innings.\nThe credit for the dismissal should go to Gujarat Lions skipper Raina who pulled off a one-handed blinder at the first slip from a good length delivery that came in after pitching and cramped the batsman for room only to induce an outside edge.\nThereafter, Supergiant skipper Smith and Tripathi took the attack to the opposition and stitched quick 63-run partnership off just 32 balls to take Gujarat Lions forward.\nTripathi smacked Praveen for two consecutive sixes and a four and then Smith hit the bowler two consecutive boundaries to pick up 25 runs from the fifth over.\nBut Tye put the brakes on the scoring with a slower delivery by removing the dangerous-looking Tripathi in his first over as the batsman went for another huge hit only to lift the ball as far as mid-off into the safe hands of Finch.\nSmith was the next to depart when he mistimed a Dwayne Smith delivery to Finch at long-on with the Supergiant scoreboard reading 89 for two in 9.2 overs.\nTye once again came tothe party when he went through the defence of Ben Stokes in the 13th over. Under-fire Dhoni's (5) woeful run in the tournament continues as he lasted a just eight deliveries, caught in plumb in front of the wicket by Ravindra Jadeja (1/40).\nManoj Tiwary (31) and Ankit Sharma (25) then added valuable 47 runs for the sixth wicket to push Supergiant's forward.\nBut Tye left his best for the last over of the innings and dismissed Ankit, Tiwary and Shardul Thakur with the first three balls to halt Supergiant's surge. Tye was at his effective as he deceived the batsmen, who went for big shots, with best with his slower balls that includes his famous knuckle delivery.\nTye was unlucky not to get his sixth wicket of the day in the form of Rahul Chahar as Jadeja dropped a simple chance in the final delivery of the innings.",

    "text": "What Service Mesh Architecture Should I Pick?\nIf you are building your software and teams around microservices, you\u2019re looking for ways to iterate faster and scale flexibly. A service mesh can help you do that while maintaining (or enhancing) visibility and control. In this blog, I\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s actually in a Service Mesh and what considerations you might want to make when choosing and deploying one.\nLooking at that list, you may think \u201cI can do all of that without a Service Mesh\u201d, and you\u2019re correct. The same logic applies to sliding window protocols or request framing. But once there\u2019s an emerging standard that does what you want, it\u2019s more efficient to rely on that layer instead of implementing it yourself. Service Mesh is that emerging layer for microservices patterns.\nService mesh is still nascent enough that codified standards have yet to emerge, but there is enough experience that some best practices are beginning to become clear. As the the bleeding-edge leaders develop their own approaches, it is often useful to compare notes and distill best practices. We\u2019ve seen Kubernetes emerge as the standard way to run containers for production web applications. My favorite standards are emergent rather than forced: It\u2019s definitely a fine art to be neither too early nor too late to agree on common APIs, protocols and concepts.\nThink about the history of computer networking. After the innovation of best-effort packet-switched networks, we found out that many of us were creating virtual circuits over them \u2013 using handshaking, retransmission and internetworking to turn a pile of packets into an ordered stream of bytes. For the sake of interoperability and simplicity, a \u201cbest practice\u201d stream-over-packets emerged: TCP (the Introduction of RFC675 does a good job of explaining what it layers on top of). There are alternatives \u2013 I\u2019ve used the Licklider Transmission Protocol in space networks where distributed congestion control is neither necessary nor efficient. Your browser might already be using QUIC. Standardizing on TCP, however, freed a generation of programmers from fiddling with implementations of sliding windows, retries, and congestion collapse (well, except for those packetheads that implemented it).\nNext, we found a lot of request/response protocols running on top of TCP. Many of these eventually migrated to HTTP (or sequels like HTTP/2 or gRPC). If you can factor your communication into \u201cmethod, metadata, body\u201d, you should be looking at an HTTP-like protocol to manage framing, separate metadata from body, and address head-of-line blocking. This extends beyond just browser apps \u2013 databases like Mongo provide HTTP interfaces because the ubiquity of HTTP unlocks a huge amount of tooling and developer knowledge.\nYou can think about service mesh as being the lexicon, API and implementation around the next tier of communication patterns for microservices.\nIn a Library that your microservices applications import and use.\nIn a Node Agent or daemon that services all of the containers on a particular node/machine.\nIn a Sidecar container that runs alongside your application container.\nThe library approach is the original. It is simple and straightforward. In this case, each microservice application includes library code that implements service mesh features. Libraries like Hystrix and Ribbon would be examples of this approach.\nThis works well for apps that are exclusively written in one language by the teams that run them (so that it\u2019s easy to insert the libraries). The library approach also doesn\u2019t require much cooperation from the underlying infrastructure \u2013 the container runner (like Kubernetes) doesn\u2019t need to be aware that you\u2019re running a Hystrix-enhanced app.\nThere is some work on multilanguage libraries (reimplementations of the same concepts). The challenge here is the complexity and effort involved in replicating the same behavior over and over again.\nWe see very limited adoption of the library model in our user base because most of our users are running applications written in many different languages (polyglot), and are also running at least a few applications that aren\u2019t written by them so injecting libraries isn\u2019t feasible.\nThis model has an advantage in work accounting: the code performing work on behalf of the microservice is actually running in that microservice. The trust boundary is also small \u2013 you only have to trust calling a library in your own process, not necessarily a remote service somewhere out over the network. That code only has as many privileges as the one microservice it is performing work on behalf of. That work is also performed in the context of the microservice, so it\u2019s easy to fairly allocate resources like CPU time or memory for that work \u2013 the OS probably does it for you.\nThe node agent model is the next alternative. In this architecture, there\u2019s a separate agent (often a userspace process) running on every node, servicing a heterogenous mix of workloads. For purposes of our comparison, it\u2019s the opposite of the library model: it doesn\u2019t care about the language of your application but it serves many different microservice tenants.\nLinkerd\u2019s recommended deployment in Kubernetes works like this. As do F5\u2019s Application Service Proxy (ASP) and the Kubernetes default kube-proxy.\nSince you need one node agent on every node, this deployment requires some cooperation from the infrastructure \u2013 this model doesn\u2019t work without a bit of coordination. By analogy, most applications can\u2019t just choose their own TCP stack, guess an ephemeral port number, and send or receive TCP packets directly \u2013 they delegate that to the infrastructure (operating system).\nInstead of good work accounting, this model emphasizes work resource sharing \u2013 if a node agent allocates some memory to buffer data for my microservice, it might turn around and use that buffer for data for your service in a few seconds. This can be very efficient, but there\u2019s an avenue for abuse. If my microservice asks for all the buffer space, the node agent needs to make sure it gives your microservice a shot at buffer space first. You need a bit more code to manage this for each shared resource.\nAnother work resource that benefits from sharing is configuration information. It\u2019s cheaper to distribute one copy of the configuration to each node, than to distribute one copy of the configuration to each pod on each node.\nA lot of functionality that containerized microservices rely on are provided by a Node Agent or something topologically equivalent. Think about kubelet initializing your pod, your favorite CNI daemon like flanneld, or stretching your brain a bit, even the operating system kernel itself as following this node agent model.\nSidecar is the new kid on the block. This is the model used by Istio with Envoy. Conduit also uses a sidecar approach. In Sidecar deployments, you have one adjacent container deployed for every application container. For a service mesh, the sidecar handles all the network traffic in and out of the application container.\nThis approach is in between the library and node agent approaches for many of the tradeoffs I discussed so far. For instance, you can deploy a sidecar service mesh without having to run a new agent on every node (so you don\u2019t need infrastructure-wide cooperation to deploy that shared agent), but you\u2019ll be running multiple copies of an identical sidecar. Another take on this: I can install one service mesh for a group of microservices, and you could install a different one, and (with some implementation-specific caveats) we don\u2019t have to coordinate. This is powerful in the early days of service mesh, where you and I might share the same Kubernetes cluster but have different goals, require different feature sets, or have different tolerances for bleeding-edge vs. tried-and-true.\nSidecar is advantageous for work accounting, especially in some security-related aspects. Here\u2019s an example: suppose I\u2019m using a service mesh to provide zero-trust style security. I want the service mesh to verify both ends (client and server) of a connection cryptographically. Let\u2019s first consider using a node agent: When my pod wants to be the client of another server pod, the node agent is going to authenticate on behalf of my pod. The node agent is also serving other pods, so it must be careful that another pod cannot trick it into authenticating on my pod\u2019s behalf. If we think about the sidecar case, my pod\u2019s sidecar does not serve other pods. We can follow the principle of least privilege and give it the bare minimum it needs for the one pod it is serving in terms of authentication keys, memory and network capabilities.\nSo, from the outside the sidecar has the same privileges as the app it is attached to. On the other hand, the sidecar needs to intervene between the app and the outside. This creates some security tension: you want the sidecar to have as little privilege as possible, but you need to give it enough privilege to control traffic to/from the app. For example, in Istio, the init container responsible for setting up the sidecar has the NET_ADMIN permission currently (to set up the iptables rules necessary). That initialization uses good security practices \u2013 it does the minimum amount necessary and then goes away, but everything with NET_ADMIN represents attack surface. (Good news \u2013 smart people are working on enhancing thisfurther).\nOnce the sidecar is attached to the app, it\u2019s very proximate from a security perspective. Not as close as a function call in your process (like library) but usually closer than calling out to a multi-tenant node agent. When using Istio in Kubernetes your app container talks to the sidecar over a loopback interface inside of the network namespace shared with your pod \u2013 so other pods and node agents generally can\u2019t see that communication.\nMost Kubernetes clusters have more than one pod per node (and therefore more than one sidecar per node). If each sidecar needs to know \u201cthe entire config\u201d (whatever that means for your context), then you\u2019ll need more bandwidth to distribute that config (and more memory to store copies of it). So it can be powerful to limit the scope of configuration that you have to give to each sidecar \u2013 but again there\u2019s an opposing tension: something (in Istio\u2019s case, Pilot) has to spend more effort computing that reduced configuration for each sidecar.\nOther things that happen to be replicated across sidecars accrue a similar bill. Good news \u2013 the container runtimes will reuse things like container disk images when they\u2019re identical and you\u2019re using the right drivers, so the disk penalty is not especially significant in many cases, and memory like code pages can also often be shared. But each sidecar\u2019s process-specific memory will be unique to that sidecar so it\u2019s important to keep this under control and avoid making your sidecar \u201cheavy weight\u201d by doing a bunch of replicated work in each sidecar.\nService Meshes relying on sidecar provide a good balance between a full set of features, and a lightweight footprint.\nWill the node agent or sidecar model prevail?\nI think you\u2019re likely to see some of both. Now seems like a perfect time for sidecar service mesh: nascent technology, fast iteration and gradual adoption. As service mesh matures and the rate-of-change decreases, we\u2019ll see more applications of the node agent model.\nAs Shawn talked about in his post, we\u2019ve been thinking about how microservices change the requirements from network infrastructure for a few years now. The swell of support and uptake for Istio demonstrated to us that there\u2019s a community ready to develop and coalesce on policy specs, with a well-architected implementation to go along with it.\nIstio is advancing state-of-the-art microservices communication, and we\u2019re excited to help make that technology easy to operate, reliable, and well-suited for your team\u2019s workflow in private cloud, public cloud or hybrid.\nSo just to clarify: in the sidecar approach you\u2019d usually (always?) implement the sidecar in it\u2019s own container, where that container is \u201cpaired\u201d with a given application\u2019s container. But how does that relate to pods? I.e. to what extent are applications typically arranged into a single container vs two or more? If I have an application that is arranged across two or more containers (in the same pod) how many sidecars would you have?\nTherefore, is the notion of a sidecar specifically one that is at the application specific, container specific, or a pod specific?\nGreat question and one that we could have done a better job of being clear on in the post. It is a sidecar for every pod.\nYou can run the sidecar inside the same container as the service itself.\nIt\u2019s docker religion that you should only run one user process in a container, but there\u2019s no practical justification for it in the context of a service and its sidecar. The recommendation refers to separate, independent processes that provide different services, and need to be allowed to fail and evolve separately. You don\u2019t want this with a service and its sidecar. Between those two you want the closest runtime coupling that can be \u2013 they should always live and die together. Which is what putting them in the same container helps achieving for cheap. When deployed into separate containers, you need to rely on the orchestration tool to ensure this.\nRunning the sidecar and the service inside the same container also reduces runtime overhead in terms of resources and latency (inter-container communication is cheap, when the containers run on the same host, but communication inside the container is even cheaper, and deploying half the number of containers, even with higher memory allocation, significantly increases deployment density).\nRunning the sidecar in the same container as the service is an even closer coupling than as a second container in the same kubernetes pod.\nWhen the sidecar is a separate container in the same pod, it has at least a few defenses against bad behavior from the service. The sidecar can bring along its own filesystem, and gets its own process namespace. This allows for instance the sidecar to have certs & keys that are not available to the service. This is helpful if you want to rely on the sidecar; for example, you might trust the sidecar to apply a policy. Other services can trust that requests signed by the sidecar did have the policy enforced.\nOn the other hand, if you view the sidecar as really just a friendly application enhancer and not a strong policy enforcer, then it\u2019s convenient to run the sidecar in the same container.\nMy experience with Kubernetes has been that it\u2019s good at killing pods even if only one of the containers dies. It\u2019s definitely possible to make or run your own container init system so you can run multiple processes and die if any die, but so far I haven\u2019t found the need.\nI\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ccommunication inside the container is even cheaper.\u201d In Kubernetes, two containers in a pod share a network namespace, so communicating over localhost is the same whether two containers in a pod or two processes in a container. Are you thinking about using shared memory or shared filesystems?\nDoes deploying half the number of containers (but with each container being \u201ctwice\u201d as big) actually increase deployment density significantly? In that case, it\u2019s still the same amount of filesystem disk bytes, running the same processes, just with some extra namespace boundaries between them. I\u2019d love to know more about this.",

    "text": "Virtual reality (VR) has been used in health care for decades. Dentistry has utilized VR simulations to relax patients, and ophthalmic researchers have used it to simulate a patient\u2019s vision with both glasses and contact lenses. Optometric institutions have begun using virtual simulation labs to teach procedures, for example, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy.\nWhen significant changes in the world occur, it takes a great deal of time. However, when everything is aligned, change hits us at light speed.\nOptometry had heard for years in the 1980s and 1990s that the move toward electronic health records (EHR) was coming. While many of us became skeptical it would happen, the changes and movement to EHRs came quickly. For ODs, it is important that we not only provide quality care, but that we deliver a first-class experience to our patients.\nHow do we differentiate ourselves from other vision care options that patients have?\nInnovative technology is certainly one way to catch a patient\u2019s attention. Most patients will appreciate ODs who are not only current but use state-of-the art technology. If we follow the news, we can see that many groups have already made significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, such as, Facebook, Google, Amazon, professional sports, and major universities. Augmented reality refers to applications in which VR is used to overlay 3-D data on live images\u2014such as the images seen through a microscope during surgery.\nHow can VR and virtual simulations improve my patients\u2019 experiences, supplement the care I deliver, and integrate into a busy optometric office?\nAt our \u201cSUNY Optometry New Technologies Hackathon I: The Future Eye Exam,\u201d there was much discussion about the use of VR during an eye exam. Some believed that it was integral to the future of eye care, and some believed that it was an expensive way to use technology that is not yet proven to have clinical value.\nAs optometry advances, virtual and augmented reality serve as important tools to teach students, residents, and ODs important diagnostic and therapeutic skills.\nSUNY College of Optometry and other optometry and ophthalmology programs utilize VR simulation laboratories as an integral part of their students\u2019 education. While VR simulations will never fully replace wet labs and training on live subjects, it can be readily used to provide the majority of training for many techniques.\nMost of us have spent many hours sitting as patients for our classmates as they learn gonioscopy, lid eversion, and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (BIO). VR simulations save our test subjects\u2019 valuable hours lost from their work or school schedules, and it reduces potential waste in the use of expensive specimens in wet labs.\nResearch has shown that BIO training for novice ophthalmology residents can be significantly improved by the use of VR simulators.\nThe ability to use VR to track eye movements has existed for some time but has been utilized mostly in sports vision training for elite athletes. Applications for visual field testing have been developed by CREWT Medical Systems in Tokyo, Japan.\nCREWT\u2019s head-mounted perimeter imo has been shown to obtain visual field sensitivity highly compatible to that obtained by the standard automated perimeter. Furthermore, CREWT\u2019s binocular random single eye test provides an effective non-occlusion test condition without the examinee being aware of which eye is being tested.\nPerhaps the entire concept of VR began with a desire to create a different human experience. Patient education and informed choice selection could be greatly enhanced by the use of virtual and augmented reality.\nClinical applications of wavefront aberrometry may be optimized by its integration with virtual and augmented reality to simulate night driving conditions, vision with premium IOLs, and correction of higher order aberrations. Researchers continue to work with VR simulations for glaucoma and low vision patients to improve patient education and to enhance patient life experiences.\nIt is impossible to predict the future of virtual and augmented reality in optometric care because it is up to us. Virtual and augmented reality presents an opportunity to differentiate our practices from others.\nGoogle has shown us that less expensive cardboard VR devices can be just as effective as more expensive models that have so far failed to capture a strong market share. It is my belief that universities and athletics will lead the way toward the more widespread use of VR.\nMy alma mater Georgetown University has started to make use of VR applications in creating 360-degree YouTube videos of the Georgetown campus for use with any VR device, e.g. cardboard VR devices.\nIn March 2016, Fox Sports broadcasted the Big East men\u2019s basketball tournament in VR format for the first time. Perhaps the time is near for optometry to utilize VR to enhance the quality of human interaction for our patients.",

One idea was to streamline the dishwashing process.\nThe wagging tails and animal snuggles make Wenjie Wang\u2019s day when she volunteers at Friends of the Dearborn Animal Shelter.\nHowever, the occasional sore back and neck do not.\n\u201cWhen you see the faces of the dogs and cats you know all the effort is worth it, but the work is repetitive and onerous,\u201d said Wang, a University of Michigan-Dearborn graduate student.\nSo Wang was happy to learn about a project in Bochen Jia\u2019s Human Factors and Ergonomics course to provide solutions for the nonprofit. Students, using methods learned in class, evaluated the shelter and came up with ideas to make the work environment less physically taxing.\nThe team of first-year graduate students\u2014composed of members Wang, Pranav Indi, Edna Martinez, Joel Church and Jie Ren\u2014did even more than come up with a plan. They sent their 75-page report \u201cErgonomic Risk Analysis of an Animal Shelter\u201d to Auburn Engineers, who hosted the 9th Annual Ergonomics Design Competition for Student Teams competition and placed third.\nThis is the second year Jia\u2019s students participated in the contest. Last year, a team from Jia\u2019s class placed sixth.\nUsing ergonomic evaluation tools, Jia\u2019s students looked at tasks such as dog walking, grooming, feeding the animals, cleaning laundry and washing dishes. Ergonomic solution suggestions included implementing the use of gentle leader leashes, increasing the height of the bathing workstation, adding feeding wall mount dispensers throughout the shelter, a new laundry process and streamlining the dish cleaning process.\nJia, who has taught the course for three years, said he continuously looks for ways to bring the real world into the classroom\u2014such as incorporating competitions and company partnerships and using ergonomics computer software.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to learn to solve the issues in class, but I want students to reach out and see the real-world problems, to help solve the problems, to apply what they learn,\u201d Jia said.\nMartinez said her time as a student in Jia\u2019s course helped her grown personally and professionally.",

All credit to the City Council, the staffs of these fine organizations and the citizens of Rancho Palos Verdes for bringing about this brilliant result. The preservation of open space adds tremendous value to our city, and greatly preserves and enhances the quality of life of its residents. Many years from today, when Southern California is even more built out and dense than it is today, future generations will marvel at, and give thanks for, the vision and wisdom of these fine people who have created this wonderful legacy for us and our children and grandchildren.\nI have two daughters attending college this year. My oldest is a junior at UCLA and a communications major. My youngest is a freshman at Cal State University, East Bay, where she is on the swim team.\nWe have seen over the years the impact on our children\u2019s schools from budget cuts. This year I feel I am at the end of my rope. The first day of classes for my oldest daughter just didn\u2019t happen. She and her professors took part in demonstrations instead of lectures. Many of the professors in the Communications Department are facing layoffs. This is already a highly impacted major. You need a very high GPA your freshman year just to get in. Now, with budget cuts, they are reducing the staff. That, to me, seemed incredible.\nLast week, however, the crisis really hit home. My youngest daughter has been sick with a cold. She was at swim practice and was having trouble breathing. She spoke to her coach and he advised her to leave practice and go directly to the student health office. She did just that only to find out that it was closed due to furloughs. How can that be? Furloughs shutting down the health care of your child?\nIs that what we want for our children in this state? How many million-dollar homes do we have here? People driving cars that are worth more than some people\u2019s homes. Shame on every lawmaker in Sacramento! Shame on all of us for letting this happen. I read the other day that our state\u2019s public college and university system has been considered a model for the rest of the country. I don\u2019t know if that is true anymore.\nI would gladly pay more in fees to know that my children will get the education and care that they deserve but I understand that that is not an option for everyone. So I ask, and it has been asked before, why do we choose to balance the budget by hurting our kids? Governor, where do your kids go to school?\nThank you for your front-page story \u201cLocal district a model of health\u201d (Wednesday).\nWriter Melissa Evans captured the benefits of the remarkable resource that Beach Cities Health District offers within the larger context of the current health care prevention and intervention debate.\nI have experienced firsthand the unique philosophy, commitment and expertise that BCHD offers by being both a consumer and a volunteer.\nBCHD has provided valuable risk-prevention and support services to two of my family members, one middle-age and the other a senior citizen.\nIn gratitude, I\u2019ve been serving as a volunteer on a strategic planning committee, witnessing how BCHD plans for and responds to its constituents.\nMany of us who read the Daily Breeze are fortunate that we are able to access health services for our loved ones and ourselves when needed.\nHowever, as a social work professor, I know that when we live in proximity to others who are at risk, whether through communicable diseases or other problems, then none of us can really be well.\nThere\u2019s a famous expression, \u201cThe safest ship in a storm is leadership.\u201d Hopefully, the public can garner the will to demand our politicians ensure that more people benefit from the visionary leadership and service delivery Chief Executive Officer Susan Burden and her staff provide for us in Hermosa, Redondo and Manhattan Beach.\nIt has recently been reported that House Minority Leader Congressman John Boehner (R-Ohio) claims he has not met a single American outside of Congress or the administration that supports a public health option.\n1. The cost of health care is wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy. Given current trend in growth of health care costs, the ranks of the uninsured will continue to grow at an accelerated rate as health insurance becomes more expensive and by 2017 Medicare will not be able to meet its commitments.\n2. The U.S. spends significantly more on health care per capita than any other industrialized nation because every other industrialized nation has a public option that controls cost.\n3. The argument that a public option will put private health insurance companies out of business is absurd, as every other industrialized nation has thriving private health insurance companies despite the public option, including those countries with so-called \u201csingle-payer\u201d plans such as England and Canada.\nBoehner\u2019s comment says more about either his integrity or the circles in which he travels than the state of our nation. Perhaps his party should be wondering if he is the right man to lead even a minority party and his constituents if he is fit for office at all.",

    "text": "Mom of Many Words: You had me at \"woof\"\nIt has been a bit of a rough week, folks. Last weekend we had to say goodbye to Cubby, our Golden Retriever. His ailment, severe pancreatitis, came on quickly and swept through his body until there was no option other than to let him go. As pet owners and animal lovers, we know going in that a day like this is basically inevitable. It doesn\u2019t stop us from making our pets a part of the family.\nWe had waited two years before we even thought about another dog after losing our first Golden Retriever, Colby (yes, it is confusing), to cancer. While the Spouse and First Born, who was away at college, were more apt to welcome another cold nose, for Second Born and me it was a tougher transition. Colby was The Dog \u2013 our baby, our true puppy love - and his death was a long-burning wound that prevented us from wanting to risk the pain again.\nThen this one came along, this canine whose name was too close for comfort to Colby, this short-snouted 2-year-old Golden Retriever in the same shelter where his predecessor had claimed us. We weren\u2019t even looking for a dog that September day. He was not supposed to change our minds. He most definitely was not going to change our hearts. Or so we thought.\nOh, but he did. Cubby wrapped our hearts around his furry paw and suckered us in. He didn\u2019t replace Colby, he simply brought to us his own sunny pooch personality, and he made us embrace him wholeheartedly. Today\u2019s column is a tribute to the light Cubby brought into our lives, as I share with you \u2013 The Top Ten Things a Golden Retriever Would Never Say.\n1. That platter of turkey is awfully close to the edge of the table. I\u2019d better try and warn someone before it ends up on the floor.\n2. Why would I want to climb on the sofa when I can be so close to the floor on this bed you got for me?\n3. You want to go for a ride in the car again? But we just went yesterday!\n4. I really don\u2019t need any more toys, but if you are going to insist on bringing them home, would you please stop getting the ones that squeak? I find them very annoying.\n5. Oops, the crate door isn\u2019t latched. I\u2019ll just stay right in here until someone gets home.\n6. I really wish people would stop rubbing my belly. Personal space, seriously.\n7. No, thanks, I don\u2019t think I should have a treat right now. It might ruin my appetite just before dinner.\n8. Shhh, quiet! A flock of birds just landed in the yard and I don\u2019t want to disturb them.\n9. Hey look, someone new just came in the house. I\u2019ll just sit calmly off to the side and wait for them to come to me.\n10. Can\u2019t you just go for a walk by yourself?\nWe all know the truth about dogs, especially breeds with the personality of a Golden Retriever. Everything they do is their favorite thing. Cubby was a redheaded charmer, trash sniffer, flirt and clown. Our handsome, crotch-sniffing, curly-haired boy gave his all to his family. We will miss that spark for quite a while. I am just getting around to removing the strongest reminders of his presence. Today we are taking food and other items to the animal shelter... but we won't be walking through the kennel area.\nIf he could be here right now, surrounded by his many mangled squeaky toys, I would tell him that I wish I had walked him more often, given him more treats and even let him up on the sofa, at least a few times. But in his adorable, slobbery way, Cubby\u2019s sweet nature let us know every day not to put emphasis on what we didn\u2019t do. His response to any regrets would have been simply this.\nYou gave me my forever home. And that was my favorite thing.",

For instance, the luxury-leaning Minimal as well as TRD Pro alone appear with bifold cabs as well as V6 engines. The TRD Pro is belted to the accepted bed breadth and four-wheel drive-- you unconcerned approve to accept amidst an accepted as well as automated transmission. If it seems like a whole lot, affront not; we accept all the obtainable combinations provided in a table below.\nThe abate of the Tacoma's two engines is accessible alone with the SR as well as SR5 trims.

The table below reveals the easily accessible combinations.\nPicking a barter may assume disconcerting with six trim degrees and also diverse engine, drive wheel, taxi, and also box options, but you're best acceptable task to baddest from either groups. The SR, SR5, and Limited trims are accepted choices for basal project as well as ancestors trucks. The 4 \u00d7 4 versions do able-bodied off-road, yet if you intend to absorb bountiful time abroad from pavement, affairs are you'll angular against among the TRD trims.

It comes approved with the four-cylinder agent however can be updated with the V6. Be exact with upgrades included in this design, however. If you purchase you're abacus a ton of \"essential\" things, you obviously will conserve cash with one of the added trims.\nThe 2018 Tacoma SR5, with a starting amount of $26,975 for the 4 \u00d7 2 and also $30,050 for a 4 \u00d7 4, includes accepted SR upgrades as criterion. The SR5 consists of keyless access with a representative immobilizer, a 4.2-inch TFT multi-information display screen, as well as Toyota's Entune Sound And also arrangement with Attached Aeronautics Application, which firm you could fasten your smartphone aeronautics setup to run through the barter affectation and speakers.\nThe 2018 Tacoma Limited, beginning at $37,140 for a 4 \u00d7 2 adaptation as well as $40,215 with four-wheel drive, sporting activities a being plentiful account of upgrades. The Restricted love account includes sophisticated dual-zone computerized altitude ascendancy as well as the college plan Entune Premium JBL audio plan with a 7.1-inch screen.

    "text": "In times of economic instability people often turn to precious metals like Gold and Silver to protect their wealth. Up to 1976 the United States had coins minted for circulation containing Silver, and these are now quite popular for investing in Silver.\nThe reason they are so popular is that they tend to have a lower price tag then your standard bullion coins. This lead the coins to earn the name \"junk\" silver. in recent years people have gained a large respect for these coins and they have since adjusted in price to be more on par with Silver's going rate.\nIt is very rare to find Silver coins in circulation anymore as many people have searched through them, and banks have started using automatic sorting machines that set the silver coins aside, but it is still good to know what you are looking at, and what you are looking for.\nQuick Reference: Just below is a quick reference table for your convenience. Feel free to print this for your personal use, but if you use it on your own website, blog, emails, etc. please include a link to this article. Thank you.\nSome resources to get you on the road to Gold and Silver investing safely, intelligently, and hopefully profitably.\nImportant words and phrases in the world of Gold and Silver investing. If you don't understand some of the words or phrases, use this as your reference.\nThis is an article similar to the one you are currently reading but it highlights the Gold coinage of the United States.\nWhile the confiscation tactics are often geared towards Gold investors, there are sales people that will tell you whatever they need to so you will purchase their goods. People will tell you that their very expensive, often overpriced, rare coins are worth the price because they cannot be confiscated. They will tell you that they have this magical ability to evade being seized in the event that the government needs your Silver. These are all lies.\nFirstly, I highly doubt that confiscation will occur as we no longer have a currency backed by Gold or Silver (which was the case when the original confiscations occurred). So all of the countries that are holding our currency cannot come running to us asking for Gold and Silver, like they did when the original confiscations occurred.\nSecondly, these assumptions, and that is what these sales people are doing, are founded on the fact that President Roosevelt exempted coins that were numismatic in nature. This does not mean that a future President would exempt them again, assuming a confiscation ever did occur. Don't be fooled by these con artists, there are plenty of honorable Gold and Silver dealers out there who would love to do business with you and not keep you up at night worrying.\nThis is a quick reference table to help you quickly identify which US coins are Silver and how much Silver content they have.\nWorld War II provided many obstacles for America. One obstacle was America's need for the metal Nickel. Because Nickels are made from - Nickel, it seemed a huge waste to put this vital metal into our coins, so they substituted the Nickel in Nickels with Silver. The only years that Nickels have ever been minted with Silver are 1942 - 1945. These are often referred to as \"Wartime Nickels.\"\nJust like nearly every other very old coin, these coins are quite scarce and run a high premium. These coins should be purchased for their beauty and historical significance more-so than their silver content as you will pay a hefty price for even a bad condition one.\nPurchasing these Dimes in awful condition will still cost you a fairly decent amount. We would not suggest investing in these coins for Silver content, but if you have an appreciation for beautiful coins and history, then these make wonderful collectibles!\nThese Dimes depict Lady Liberty sitting on a rock and holding a shield that reads \"LIBERTY\" across it. These Dimes carry a relatively high collectors premium and tend to be somewhat rare compared to the newer Dime issues. There are also different versions that exist called \"varieties\" that feature small differences like different sized dates. These are a good coin to begin with if you want a nice historical coin that won't necessarily cost you a few hundred dollars.\nThe Barber Dimes are very popular dimes among collectors. They feature the portrait of Liberty as depicted by Charles Barber. These Dimes are more scarce than their more recent counterparts, and this creates a higher premium on these coins. You may still find bad condition specimens of these Dimes with a relatively low price tag but you will still most likely pay more for this coin than you would for a newer Dime.\nThese Dimes are often called \"Mercury Dimes\" because of the image on the coin, but the image is actually of Liberty with Wings on her hat. The wings are supposed to symbolize freedom of thought. These Dimes are more highly collected due to their increasing rarity, so these are being less invested in for their Silver and more-so for their rarity.\nYou can still get these in a lesser condition for about the same price you can get one of the newer Roosevelt's but don't expect a great condition coin for only the price of its Silvers content.\nThese are the most common of the Dimes that you will receive if collecting Dimes for Silver content. These Dimes had the highest mintage rates out of all of the other Silver dimes and they are the most current ones made. These are often referred to as \"junk silver\" or \"junk dimes\" because of their relatively easy availability. Any Dimes that you may get that are older than these tend to have a higher value than what the silver in them is worth.\nThis is their \"collectible value\" or \"numismatic value.\" Any made after 1964 are just worth 10 cents, and that is because Congress passed the law that removed Silver from them.\nMore Information: Article on American Silver Roosevelt Dimes.\nVery much like the Draped Bust Dimes, these Quarters are extremely scarce and will carry a very high premium. The Obverse of the coin features a portrait of Ann Willing Bingham, wife of Senator William Bingham. These coins also came in different varieties, so it is highly suggested that if you do purchase any of these coins, you do so from a reputable dealer. These coins are fantastic to collect for their historical value, but very impractical as a Silver investment due to their very high premium.\nWhile these Quarters will be less scarce than the Draped Bust, these are definitely a collectors coin more-so than an investment coin. These coins began featuring Lady Liberty on the obverse and are stunning coins. Capped Bust Quarters are very scarce in comparison to newer Quarters and carry a high premium as well. They are a historically significant coin for America because it was the first series to use the collar method that is used today. These coins also come in varieties so it is important to purchase them from a reputable dealer.\nThe Seated Liberty Quarter features Lady Liberty Seated on a rock and holding a shield with \"Liberty\" inscribed across it. These coins are still relatively available but still carry a decent premium. I would not suggest purchasing these only for Silver content, but if you want a nice historical coin that is still relatively affordable then these are a good place to start.\nBarber Quarters, much like Barber Dimes, are a more pricey coin to buy when compared to more recent coins, but are a more inexpensive way to own a piece of Silver history. You will still pay a decent premium on the coin in good condition because of its numismatic value, but it is a very fine piece of history that can still be had at a very reasonable price.\nThe Standing Liberty Quarters are a great way to own a piece of recent history, while investing in Silver at the same time. For a decent to good condition coin you will pay a bit of a premium because they are still relatively rare, but in a more regular to bad grade version of the coin you will pay a modest premium compared to its Silver content. I enjoy purchasing these in lower conditions because of the price difference. They are still relatively old, and poorer conditions can be gotten at a modest premium over the silver value.\nIf you are buying American coins for their Silver content then you will most likely end up with many of these. They have modest premiums, excluding key dates, and they are widely available even in the best conditions. These are very popular coins with Silver investors, but few consider that they will eventually have a historic value to them just as all previous coins do.\nThis is an extremely rare and hard to come by coin. Even a poor condition will cost you multi-hundreds of dollars. The coin's obverse depicts Lady Liberty with her free flowing hair.\nEven these in some of their worst conditions will run you an easy $25.00. This is due to their relative rarity and historical value. There are many different varieties, so if you stumble upon one of these ungraded, then you may want to send it into a reputable coin grader to see if you've struck gold!\nThis Half-Dollar, like the other coins in this set, feature the wife of Senator Bingham. These coins are beautiful and historic. They will run you $100 dollars easily in bad condition. Again, not exactly the most practical for Silver investment, but lovely coins nonetheless.\nThe Seated Liberty Half-Dollar is a lovely coin, but unfortunately a lovely example will cost you a hefty sum of money. To complicate things, this coin has many different varieties, some making the coin slightly more expensive, others making the coin astronomically more expensive. This coin is wonderful for collecting, but probably wouldn't make a good Silver investment coin if you plan on having silver in any substantial quantity.\nThe Barber series is quite popular among collectors. Nice examples will cost you big while decent examples can range from the low to mid hundreds. Low quality examples can be had for less than $100.00. Again, not very practical for Silver investment, but great for coin collecting. This is one of the more regal looking coins minted by America in my opinion.\nHigh grade versions of this coin are very expensive, but low quality ones are relativly available and put you closer to the Silver investment category. If in very bad condition, some can be gotten for less than $10.00. This is still a premium over the price of Silver (as of the date of this writing.) but it is not too horrible.\nThese half-dollars are very popular among collectors. Much like the Walking Liberties these can be had in low grade conditions at very affordable prices and are a good way to get your Silver investment building. Mid-condition will definitely be more pricey but is a good step towards having a Silver investment and coin collecting.\nThe Kennedy is about the most popular Silver investment choice that people make. This can be heavily attributed to availability. The 1964 versions are 90% silver and the 1965 - 1970 versions are 40%. The 40% can be had for about the going price of Silver, and sometimes cheaper because they are less popular, and more available. This makes the 40% coins ideal for investing in Silver.\nRoughly only 162,000 of these were minted, so these are going to obviously be quite rare. These were one of the first coins minted in the United States of America. If you have one of these you need not worry about investing in Silver!\nAnother rare specimen of an early dollar, be ready to drop $1,000.00 for a low quality specimen that is so bad you'd barely be able to recognize it was a coin.\nA beautiful coin, and one of my favorite designs. Even a terrible grade will run you a couple hundred dollars. I wouldn't suggest buying this for silver investment but I certainly would get one for collecting. This design first appeared on the Gobrecht dollars, but so few were actually minted I didn't put them on this list.\nThe Trade Dollar was originally issued to compete with foreign coinage during trade between countries. Due to some very complicated matters the coins became very unpopular during their time in America and were basically forgotten about until the early 1900s. The coins are now highly sought after. Many that you find may have cuts into them. These are called chop marks and were the marks of Asian assayers to guarantee the purity. Due to their new found popularity these coins will be quite expensive.\nThese are some of the most available Silver Dollars on the market due to their long run and large amounts of production. If you are to invest in Silver Dollars these would be a great choice in lower condition. Due to a recent surge in demand for higher quality ones you will pay a much higher premium for those grades.\nThe Peace Dollar is another popular series of coin. This coin has a lot of controversy about it due to its design, the time period it was released in and the newly realized 1964 versions. Supposedly all of the 1964 dollars were melted down, but rumors exist that some may be hidden away by their owners. Currently it is illegal to own one of the 1964 Peace Dollars.\nThese 40% Dollars can be worth a bundle in high grades. If you decide to add some of these for a Silver investment then you must know that only the San Francisco mint made Silver ones.\nThis is a good resource. Some not to be found in circulation coins were missing, like the silver 3 cent piece, the half dime, and the twenty cent piece. But, these are too valuable to concern oneself with silver content. You covered the important ones.\nWill definitely bookmark this site for info on silver coins. Well done.\nWow, there is some really great information in here. I was totally unaware of confiscations until this artile. I've always enjoyed searching for Silver Wartime nickels in rolls from the bank. The show up surprisingly often. Voted beautiful and up!\nThanks for the hub. Based on your information, I consider myself rich as I have a lot of coins mentioned in the hub, some from 1800s.When I think that some of them are 90% silver, I know I need to keep them until I can negotiate a decent offer. A friend asked me about my coin collection and I was willing to part with it because I needed money. However,now that I know how much silver I have in the coins,I will not part with them easily.\nThank you for the lovely comment Research Analyst! It is really fun when you are searching through your change and you find a piece of silver in it. It's like a mini treasure hunt. I'm glad that I could provide this information to you.\nthis is a great resource for identifying U.S. Silver Coins, especially now in such a down economy people are looking for ways to invest their money into valuable coin collections.\nThank you so much for your compliments. It makes me very happy to hear that this may assist you in some way. At the very worst, this is just something fun to know. I'm glad to hear that people may actually use this. I've hears some stories from very prominent hubbers that wrote these fantastic hubs and spent tons of time but few actually reference it. I did spend a lot of time and hope that it serves you and any other readers well.\nWhat a great hub! I can really appreciate a piece of work I know has taken a lot of time and effort. It's answered a lot of questions for me. Wow, seriously great job! I will refer back to it, definitely.\n@Army Infantry Mom: I tried very hard to put together as comptrehensive a list as possible. I've been working on it for quite a few weeks now, but it really came together nicely. I'm really glad that you enjoyed it and I hope that it helps your son out.\n@VioletSun: It's always neat finding special coins in the change. I always search through my change to see if I can find any goodies. I'm glad that I was able to share my knowledge with you.\nI am not a coin collector, but have on occasion wondered what adds value to a coin just in case I should be lucky and find a rare coin with my change. LOL!\nInformative article, I learned something new today.\nWow,..you covered just about everything. I appreciate the time it must have takin you to put this together. My younger son is intrested in coin collections,..this will benefit him well. Props to you !!!",

    "text": "I am a \"born-again\" Christian, and want to share THE good news with you! What is a \"born-again Christian\", you ask? Born-again Christians have realized they're sinners and are eternally separated from God. The only way to overcome the separation sin has caused, is to accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. God sent Jesus (his one and only son) to die on the cross for our sins. He alone is the only way to God.\nWhy Should I Believe this God/Jesus thing?\nChristianity is unique because, unlike most other religions, Christians believe there is not a single earthly thing we can do that will get us closer to God. Because of this, God sent his only son, Jesus, to pay the penalty for our sins. In other words, God condescended to earth to give us a way to be with Him.\nBut, I'm a good person. I try to live a good life.\nLike everyone, we all have the ability to do good things. However, God has made it perfectly clear in his Word that we are a sinful and fallen race. Every single person on this planet is inherently evil; you don't have to teach a baby how to be bad, they're just born with selfish instincts. Everyone lies, everyone has taken something that doesn't belong to them at one time or has done something to hurt someone else. That's called sin. God does not tolerate sin, which is why we can never do enough good things to \"make up\" for the bad.\nOkay, so I've sinned a few times. Does that really mean I won't go to Heaven?\nThat depends. Let's assume we're on trial for our sins, and God is the judge. Based on the evidence of our sins (when compared to God's standards and law) we are all found guilty. The our sentence is eternal separation from God, which is also referred to as \"death\" in the Bible. At that moment Jesus enters the room and tells the judge He will accept the sentence on our behalf. The judge looks at us and says, \"My son, has offered to pay the penalty for all of your sins. By doing so, He will be put to death for the sins you've committed, and you will be free to go. Do you accept?\"\nWe have a choice! God loves us so much that He's given us a choice to accept the gift of Jesus or not.\nSounds good! I'll accept that gift!\nNot so fast. God is sovereign, so He knows the motivations in our heart. He knows if you accept Jesus's sacrifice for your own selfish motives. He knows if you never really change...that after the trial ends you walk out the door and keep living the same life you had been living. As such, it's a change of heart that needs to happen before you accept Jesus. You accept the gift because you want to leave your old life and begin a new, holy life guided by God's will for you. This means you need to turn away from your sinful ways and seek God's perfect standards. By doing that and accepting Jesus's sacrifice can you truly be seen as worthy by God.\nSo, if God loves us so much, why does he allow terrible things to happen to people (earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, etc.)?\nRemember, we are all born evil. There is no such thing as an innocent person on this planet. As such, we don't deserve anything. Since God created us, He has the right to do or not do anything He desires. As humans, we cannot possibly comprehend the thoughts of God outside of what Scripture teaches us. God doesn't have to explain himself to us, so why question God's authority? Everything that happens on Earth can be used for God's perfect plan. As much as I may not like it, I trust it implicitly.\nYou may be familiar with the fish-shaped symbol frequently seen on cars or advertised by small businesses. This fish is actually called an \"icthus\", which Greek for the word \"fish\" and is also an acronym for \"Jesus\" \"Christ\" \"God\" \"Son\" \"Savior\".\nEarly Christians used the icthus as a secret identifier since they could be killed for their faith. It's believed when a Christian would encounter another person, they would draw an arc on the ground. If the other person could complete the symbol, it proved they were a Christian.\nThe fish symbol was adopted by Christians since the Bible frequently refers to fish and fisherman. Christians are called to be \"fishers of men\"; that we have a responsiblity to share the Good News of Christ with other people.",

Besides saving money, there are a number of great advantages to buying a pre-owned car. At our Volkswagen dealer near New Haven, we understand the hesitancy some customers might have to purchase a used vehicle. To help you with your decision, we\u2019ve compiled five reasons why you should buy your next car used.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that used vehicles cost a lot less than new ones. When you purchase a used car, you\u2019ll be saving thousands of dollars since new vehicles depreciate fast. Besides depreciation, you\u2019ll also pay less sales tax and car insurance. In many states, it\u2019s cheaper to register a used car than it is for a new car.\nEvery person has different tastes and preferences when it comes to cars. If your dream model isn\u2019t made anymore, the used car market has you covered. When you visit a car dealership, chances are it will have a wide variety of used vehicles for sale of different makes, models, and years. Check out our used cars for sale, and you\u2019ll find that we carry more than Volkswagen models on our lot!\nMost car dealerships offer certified pre-owned vehicles that are high quality and low mileage. CPO programs vary depending on the manufacturer, with a significant difference between manufacturer certified and dealership certified. Manufacturer certified vehicles come with a warranty, and often include added perks such as free roadside assistance or a free loaner car when needed.\nWith the help of vehicle history reports like Carfax and AutoCheck, it\u2019s become a lot easier to obtain important information on a used car. Having easy access to a pre-owned vehicle\u2019s history will give you greater peace of mind when buying one.\nAs time progresses, automakers are finding more ways to construct reliable vehicles that\u2019ll keep on cruising for miles and miles. When you purchase a car, you\u2019ll be able to count on it to last roughly 200,000 miles or more when it\u2019s properly taken care of.\nWhen it comes time to purchase your used vehicle, make your way over to our Volkswagen dealership! Our knowledgeable sales team will be more than happy to assist you.\nIf you have any questions or comments for our New Haven area VW dealer, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us at (855) 250-6818.",

I\u2019d often slip my finger into his soft, tiny hand and stare at him when I wasn\u2019t entertaining all the visitors we had.\nAnd yet, the crushing bubble was already welling up inside me, the bubble that would burst soon after I came home. I could feel the pressure of emotions filling up my rib cage. It wasn\u2019t just that I felt so fat and so exposed; I felt incapable. I felt more overwhelmed than I\u2019d ever felt about anything \u2014 even the cancer I\u2019d dealt with. At least with cancer it was just the disease and me. This time another person was thrown into the mix. A person that I would be responsible for, whose character I would be largely accountable for molding and shaping, who might or might not give me heartfelt Mother\u2019s Day cards at some point in his life.\nWhat if I messed it all up? A million and one scenarios raced through my mind, which was growing ever manic.\nAnd, as if my mind weren\u2019t in enough pain, my body had discovered a whole new level of anguish. I would complain. And then I would feel guilty, because, after all, I did get a baby out of the deal, and women didn\u2019t always have it so \u201ceasy.\u201d And then time would pass and I\u2019d repeat that cycle of complaining and guilt.\nSo it was on day two, around 7:00 p.m., that one of the crabbier nurses on staff came in and announced very flatly that I had to take a shower. That night. I could sense a hint of disgust in her voice, and I, of course, took that very personally to mean that I especially had to hurry up and shower because of my size.\nThe bubble of panic inside me grew ever larger.\nMy stepmom, Sara, was staying with me that night so that Chad could go home and get some real rest. Before I could even think about crying, the tears were streaming down my face. I began to choke back sobs. The nurse looked at me, expressionless, and left the room.\nI knew I couldn\u2019t shower by myself. I could barely walk. Someone would have to help me, and I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me looking this enormous, swollen, bruised, and disgusting, my lower abdomen stained dark orange from the Betadine covering my C-section incision. I only wanted the help of one person, and he\u2019d just left.\nMy head was exploding with protests: I\u2019ll just refuse! They can\u2019t make me! They can\u2019t! I can\u2019t let anyone see me like this. I\u2019ll die of shame. I\u2019ll never stop crying. And then I remembered that the walk from my hospital room to the parking garage was quite a long one. Maybe Chad hadn\u2019t made it to the car yet. Maybe he\u2019d come back and help me.\nI frantically dialed his cell phone from my hospital line. I could hear the echo of the parking garage in his voice, and he could hear the panic and sorrow in mine. He hadn\u2019t left yet and he\u2019d be right back. I was flooded with relief.\nI started crying again the minute I saw his face.\nSara said she\u2019d watch the baby while he helped me take my shower.\nChad helped me to the bathroom. I hobbled more with each step, my breath hissing out of me. He helped get my gown off. I grimaced and apologized, but he only shook his head and told me not to worry about anything.\nI didn\u2019t really want him to have to see me like this, but I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else I needed more.\nBut I worried in spite of myself. I wondered if he\u2019d ever be able to put the horrific picture of what I looked like at that moment out of his mind. I wondered if this moment would forever taint our love life.\nHe literally had to lift each of my legs into the shower, one at a time, because I was so weak. The warm water felt surprisingly good, but I was terrified of doing anything with my incision. The nurses had told me that I had to soap up the stapled gash and softly scrub it with a washcloth. I didn\u2019t even want to know how painful that was going to be. I was shaking from weakness and fear.\n\u201cJust tell me what to do,\u201d he said softly.\nAnd so I guided him. He gently washed my hair first and for a moment, I felt like a little girl again. Then he slowly lathered the rest of my body, avoiding the incision until I was ready.\nHe was standing outside of the shower and his shirt was soaked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting all wet,\u201d I said, my voice shaking.\n\u201cI guess we need to wash my incision,\u201d I said weakly.\nOur eyes locked and I began sobbing. I was so afraid and felt so wounded and exhausted. He put his arms around me as I sobbed on his soaking wet shoulder.\nI sobbed even harder. I\u2019d never felt so loved in all my life.\nMoments later, he very gently cleaned my incision and surprisingly, the pain was minimal. It was something I didn\u2019t think a husband should ever have to do, but he did it with such love and compassion. He uttered not one complaint.\nHe helped me ease out of the shower and wrapped me in a towel. We stood there just holding each other for what seemed like a million years.\nI knew having the baby would change our lives forever, but this moment changed our love forever. In those moments, we developed a bond so deep it takes my breath away just thinking about it.",

It was revealed that the personal data of 87 million users was caught up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal - far higher than the 50 million originally reported. In addition to which, Facebook has also admitted to a flaw in its search function which allowed accounts to be searched by email address and phone number, and now believes \"most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way.\"\nSpeaking on a press call last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that more should have been done to protect user data. He also said that the company \u201cdidn\u2019t take a broad enough view\u201d of its responsibility to protect the platform from the likes of fake news, foreign interference and hate speech. The call came just a week before Zuckerberg is due to appear before the House of Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington (11th April) to discuss the scandal and issues related to consumer data privacy. While Zuckerberg appears in Washington, other top Facebook executives (including its Chief Operating Officer and its Deputy Privacy Chief) are set to appear before other authorities in Europe to discuss the privacy issues - including the EU's justice commissioner and a U.K. parliament committee.\nLast week, industry watchdog the Media Rating Council (MRC) passed Facebook's accreditation \"to correctly report ad impressions on Facebook and Instagram after the first of three rounds of audits the company agreed to undergo\". The next two rounds are set to focus on the platform's ability to correctly report viewability. While this accreditation gives bigger advertisers an insight into the stats they\u2019ve long waited for, as well as being a much needed win for Facebook in light of recent events, opinions are still divided just how much these changes will really mean to smaller advertisers.\nFacebook Messenger bots are getting multiple personalities, Snapchat partners with Amazon - and more.

    "text": "Learning How to Love My Kids, Again (or why I'm thankful for Veteran's day even though it means another day off of school) | Thin Places | A blog by Amy Julia Becker on Faith, Family, and Disability.\nOur day started at 5:50, with William by my bedside. \"Mommy, the only thing that will make me happy is if you give me a movie right now.\"\nI squeezed my eyes shut. \"William, is it six o'clock yet?\"\n\"No. It was taking too long.\"\nWilliam knows two things: he is supposed to stay in his bed until 6:00, and he only gets to watch something on weekend mornings.\n\"William, you can go back to your bed for ten minutes and then I will come up, or you can go start an art project by yourself.\"\n\"But Mommy! The only thing that will make me happy is a movie right now!\"\nI've been attending a parenting class based upon Positive Discipline. The premise is that discipline doesn't need to be punishment, and that acting positive doesn't mean giving permission to do everything. It involves lots of \"strategies\" and \"solutions\" to problems. The adult retains authority, but not because of an assertion of power and control but because of firm but loving guidance for the child. I completely agree with this approach from a theoretical and spiritual perspective. I understand God as a Father who gives us \"rules\" out of love and care for us, not out of a desire to dominate our lives, a Father who is \"for\" us and wants our best. I see myself as a parent who wants to provide a lot of structure for our children, which includes rules and expectations, coupled with a lot of love.\nSo Positive Discipline seems right up my alley. And in the classroom of adults-pretending-to-be-children, it works really well. This past Monday, we solved the problem of one kid terrorizing a cat and another (mine) drawing with milk all over the table.\nIt hasn't worked out quite as well in our home. Last week (on Monday, three hours after class, as it happens) William and I played a Busytown game. At the end of the game, I was feeling very proud of myself for sharing \"special time\" with my son and crawling around on the floor searching for ladders and clocks and all the other objects on the game's board.\nWilliam was not feeling that same pride. He started throwing the pieces all over the room. I put on my Positive Discipline hat and considered the logical consequences of his actions. I told him if he treated the game like garbage, I would put it in the garbage. I gave him the chance to go to his room to calm down, and then decide. Ten minutes later, he looked me straight in the eye (with his pacifier, giraffe, and blanket, just in case I'm tempted to forget that he's four when we fight with each other and he wins, which is what seems to happen most days), and said, \"Throw it away.\"\nI made a big fuss of putting the whole game in a garbage bag and taking it to the trash bins outside. I then realized that a) I had cleaned up the entire game while William lounged in his bed and b) I was about to throw away a perfectly good game. So it is currently stored in the trunk of our car, and I am still trying to figure out how I should have handled that one differently.\nBut back to this morning.\n\"William, you know that we've agreed that we don't watch movies in the morning.\"\nHe starts pounding the bed. Hard. Over and over and over. In the dark.\nLet's just say it did not end well, and I found myself longing for a different model of parenting, one in which the parents asserted control and the kids just listened and did what they were told and there was none of this unbelievably time-consuming, emotionally-draining, hard hard hard work of figuring out how to love the kid and listen to the kid and be firm and clear, and all before the sun comes up.\nAnd of course, it's Veteran's Day. So we have yet another week with a day (or two or three, as has happened a lot recently) off from school. (We haven't had a full week of school since the first week of October.) And this day has begun, in the dark, in tears.\nI was ready to write a post today about why schools should stay open for national holidays. Close the banks. Close the post office. But keep the schools open and teach the kids about what or whomever deserves commemoration rather than offering yet one more disruptive three-day weekend. I stand by my guns on this one (yet another issue that would garner all the Mom votes in the next election), but it turns out I'm grateful that today was a day with no place to go and time on our hands as a family.\nAnd it was kind of fun. For all of us. William and Penny took turns using the scissors and got excited when they found great pictures to accompany our different items and hanging up a gigantic piece of paper on the wall of the playroom is hugely exciting. Even though it only refers to the morning, they've spent the whole day referring back to our chart to try to figure out what is supposed to happen next.\nI don't know whether it will help tomorrow morning to refer to our schedule. Moreover, I don't know if it will help two weeks from now. But I know that I'm back to believing that it is worth it to figure out how to provide the boundaries my kids need in order to grow up, how to provide structure and freedom at the same time, how to create the order that allows creativity and flourishing. I'm back to believing it's worth it to learn how to love them well.",

    "text": "If your car is in need of a new windshield, you might be worried that it will cost you a lot of money. It is possible for the costs to add up, but luckily, there are a few tips that you can follow that will help you save money on a new windshield for your car.\nSome windshield replacement companies offer mobile services and are willing to come to you to replace your windshield, which can be a handy service. However, you might be charged an additional service charge for the service, so if you are able to drive your car to the shop and don't mind doing so, you might be able to save a few bucks by doing so. Additionally, when taking your car to a shop, make sure that you take it to one that specializes in glass replacement; some people make the mistake of taking their vehicle to a regular body shop, for example, and the body shop could end up charging a fee simply to take the car to a glass repair professional for them. You can keep that money in your pocket by taking your car to a glass shop yourself in the first place.\nSome people assume that once they see a little bit of damage to their windshield that they do not have any options other than to completely replace the glass. However, this is not always the case at all. Some glass repair pros who specialize in doing auto work are actually able to make repairs, such as to windshields that have minor chips, which can be more affordable than buying a new windshield altogether. This will depend on the severity of damage to your windshield, so ask your glass repair pro to take a look at it.\nDepending on your insurance company, you might not be on the hook for the cost of your windshield replacement at all. Instead, you might be able to count on your insurance company to cover all or most of the cost for you. Consider calling your insurance agent to find out if this is an option for you.\nAs you can see, there are a few different ways that you can save money on your car windshield replacement. If you follow these tips, you might find that the cost of your windshield replacement isn't nearly as expensive as you thought it might be!\nFor more information and options, contact a windshield replacement company, like Econo Glass Company.",

    "text": "A Netherlands public agency responsible for providing social benefits was struggling to create an efficient system for detecting fraud in applications to receive social benefits. Only a very small fraction of the applications that were flagged by the system for possible fraud turned out to be actual fraud; in fact, the great majority was \u201cfalse positives.\u201d The need to investigate such a large number of false positives was overwhelming the agency\u2019s capacity to review cases and root out real cases of deceit.\nDeloitte Netherlands invited the agency to visit the Greenhouse for a demonstration of how advanced analytics could be used to detect fraud more reliably. The solution that Deloitte Netherlands\u2019 analytics specialists had in mind was a \u201cmachine learning\u201d program: one that would teach itself to flag benefits applications for possible fraud and use feedback from the fraud team\u2019s analysis to gain accuracy over time.\nAhead of the Greenhouse session, Deloitte Netherlands received samples of the client\u2019s actual benefits application records, some fraudulent and some legitimate. Working closely with the client\u2019s software vendor, Deloitte Netherlands\u2019 analytics team created a model to scan the records and devise a logical method of identifying applications that appeared fraudulent. That model would be put to the test in the Greenhouse.\nDeloitte Netherlands began the Greenhouse session by explaining how machine learning works; in this case they showed how a computer learns to judge whether a head photographed from behind belongs to a man or a woman. The machine-learning model uses a \u201ctraining\u201d sample of photographs\u2014photos identified as men or women\u2014to create a formula for predicting gender based on a weighted combination of visual attributes such as hair length and neck size. Every successive training case enabled the model to gain prediction accuracy by changing the importance it assigns to each attribute.\nNext, the team ran the fraud-detection model it had created for the client. The team fed a batch of application records into the model. Like the photographic-prediction model, the fraud-detection model became increasingly accurate as it churned through the new batch of records and refined its logic for making fraud predictions based on each record\u2019s attributes. By the end of the session, the model was operating at approximately 75 percent prediction accuracy\u2014a big improvement over the client\u2019s existing accuracy rate.\nThe Greenhouse session provided the agency with a firsthand look at how predictive analytics really works. It was also the first time the agency had seen advanced analytics applied to their work, and it convinced them to proceed with implementing the predictive model that Deloitte Netherlands had showcased in the Greenhouse. The model was eventually flagging fraudulent applications with 95 percent accuracy. The model not only increased the efficiency of the fraud department, but also stopped a large number of fraudulent payments. Further analysis of the predicted and validated fraud cases also revealed valuable insight into fraud patterns.",

    "text": "The Mozambique Country Commercial Guide (CCG) presents a comprehensive look at Mozambique\u2019s commercial environment using economic, political, and market analysis.\nThough one of Africa\u2019s poorest nations, Mozambique\u2019s annual growth rate averaged 7% over the past decade. In 2015, real GDP slowed to 6.2% due to a fall in commodity prices as well as floods in the north of the country and droughts in the south. GDP fell to 3.1% in 2017, due to an economic crisis after the discovery in 2016 of $2 billion in government-backed loans made to three state-owned defense and security companies without parliamentary approval and notification to the IMF. Economic growth is projected to be below 4% in 2018 but gradually rise to 8% over the next decade. GDP growth has traditionally been driven by the agriculture, construction, and financial sectors, while growth in the next decade is expected to be driven by the oil and gas industry due to the discovery of vast natural gas deposits.\nDuring the second half of 2016 the metical depreciated sharply, though it has since stabilised. The devaluation of the metical caused higher than expected inflation and forced the Mozambican Central Bank to impose harsh foreign currency control measures. Borrowers in local currency face interest rates of up to 30%, which hinders entrepreneurship and business development, although such rates are beginning to decline slowly. To cover the government account deficit, the Government of Mozambique requested a USD283 million loan from the IMF, but this loan was put on hold due to the government\u2019s lack of transparency in its public debt portfolio. The IMF has maintained a technical assistance mission in Maputo, which consults frequently with the Mozambican government, but has declined to offer either a funded or unfunded program until such time as the Mozambican government institutes reforms in public financial management and provides additional details on the use of the $2 billion in government-backed commercial loans made to state owned companies.\nThe Government of Mozambique encourages foreign direct investment (FDI). Currently, FDI is largely in infrastructure and the extraction of minerals, including graphite, coal, and gemstones. FDI investment slowed dramatically since 2015, largely due to the economic crisis, a drop in commodity prices, especially coal and aluminium, and slow negotiations in the development of hydrocarbon projects.\nSouth Africa and Portugal are Mozambique\u2019s largest trading partners. Brazil, China, India, and Japan have established projects in Mozambique and are increasing their investments. The largest bilateral donor of development assistance is the United States, which until recently was not a major trade partner. However, U.S. involvement in the oil and gas sector will create significant demand for U.S. exports in that sector, as well as others, and the U.S. is likely to become the largest investor in Mozambique in the next decade.\nSeveral megaprojects will be the key drivers for the Mozambican economy in the next five years and will provide both direct and indirect business opportunities. The most significant opportunities are the construction of separate onshore Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants by separate consortia led by Anadarko and ExxonMobil valued at USD25-30 billion and over $20 billion, respectively. Exploration activities by ExxonMobil, Rosneft, ENI, Sasol, and others will provide further opportunities in the oil and gas sector. The development of the Nacala Logistics Corridor, comprising multiple industrial projects and a transportation corridor valued in the billions of dollars, offers additional opportunities. The corridor will serve as the logistics backbone for the north of the country, providing services both for the off-shore development of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon deposits (most of which are found in the northern region)and the development of the northern region\u2019s potentially lucrative inland agricultural and mining sectors.\nSimilar to other emerging markets, Mozambique has a very weak power infrastructure that is concentrated in urban locations but sparse throughout rural areas. Its limited transmission capacity runs the length of the country, connecting the northern and southern parts of Mozambique into a single grid. It is common for industry and business to rely on backup generators for long periods of time due to intermittent power supply. One of the most successful infrastructure projects in Mozambique, the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam with a 2075MW capacity, is located in the Tete Province on the Zambezi River. This dam supplies power to Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Mozambique has strong potential for hydroelectric and thermal power generation, as well as for solar and wind farms along its lengthy coastline. However, the underdeveloped power grid and bureaucratic hurdles make the development of power projects difficult and time consuming.\nThe transportation sector is expanding, driven by major investments in ports and road infrastructure. There are three major ports in the country: Maputo for the southern part of the country, Beira for the center, and Nacala for the north. The Nacala Port is considered one of the best deep-water ports in East Africa. The far northern ports of Pemba and Palma require substantial upgrades in order to provide logistics support for planned oil and gas projects. Infrastructure and construction project development remain vibrant in Mozambique despite the general economic slowdown.\nMozambique currently ranks 138th out of 190 countries in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business report, a significant drop from its 127th ranking in 2014. Some improvements were made in insolvency legislation and streamlining procedures for registering property, paying taxes, and obtaining construction permits. However, registration of businesses, labor laws, and access to land and infrastructure continue to restrict economic opportunities. Myriad bureaucratic and infrastructure challenges, such as getting access to electricity and water, are often cited as barriers to doing business. Access to credit remains a major obstacle for companies to operate competitively. Because of issues related to the non-disclosed, government-backed commercial loans, Mozambique dropped five places in 2016 in the \u201cDoing Business\u201d report\u2019s Access to Credit indicator.",

    "text": "Running a successful hotel, when you hit the bottom line, comes back to one thing: driving profitable bookings.\nWill that new carpet look good in pictures? Does your staff respond quickly enough to guest requests? Are the restaurant\u2019s offerings up to Yelp\u2019s standards? Every issue in a hotel comes back to how the guest feels about it. The same thing is true when it comes to getting them to book.\nWhen a guest books your hotel, why do they do it? It\u2019s often a complicated process involving everything from how easy it is for them to use your website, to reviews they read, your gallery, and how your offers stack up against the competition.\nToday, we\u2019re looking at a deceptively simple question: how do you not only maintain, but grow direct bookings to raise your hotel\u2019s occupancy rate and, ultimately, revenue?\nTwo immediate answers sprang to our minds: targeted marketing and special offers. Are they the only way to get more hotel bookings? Of course not! They\u2019re one part of an integrated strategy. However, they are proven strategies that any hotelier can use to get more customers through the door.\nConsider this your primer on special offers and targeted marketing for your hotel.\nRepeating the same offers, or failing to specialize for holidays and seasons, can make your hotel marketing stale. Switch things up a little. Create new offers and packages regularly to attract more customers.\nThere can be logistical difficulties coordinating with local companies, so an alternative to making this a special offer could be publishing content about these local adventures on your hotel\u2019s blog, social networks or the \u2018Activities\u2019 section of your website. Don\u2019t be afraid to get creative \u2013 highlighting all the great activities near your hotel can be a serious boost to bookings.\nThis will be great for your laid-back, \u201cchilled\u201d customers \u2013 or those that would like to be a little more relaxed. Get in touch with local yoga studios and see if they\u2019re doing sunrise/sunset classes on the beach, or get local teachers to visit your hotel and teach a class in your spa.\nIn your offer, you might discuss how stress has a negative impact on people\u2019s lives \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to throw in some light research and facts. Then, close by talking about how relaxation and meditation are health boosters and introduce your package.\nThis offer, paired with a discount at your spa or a buy-one-treatment-get-one-free offer, will speak to the stressed out mothers and busy professionals looking to get away for a weekend.\nPartner up with wedding planners and event organizers and offer them discounts and deals at your hotel. Consider offering a free glass of champagne on arrival for the bride, groom and family, or a discounted spa treatment for the bridal party. If you\u2019re encouraging weddings that involve overnight guests, offer a discounted room rate if a wedding is hosting more than a certain number of people for the night.\nWedding packages are one of the best ways to set your hotel apart from competing wedding venues. You have the opportunity to present your hotel as a warm, welcoming environment, with the little perks that make any bride and groom feel like you value their happy day as much as they do.\nHost local contests and events to give you more exposure. There\u2019s a ton of options for you to choose from \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t have to be extravagant or expensive. It could be something as simple as a pub quiz, or a bird-watching walk.\nYou can also host fun fitness contests for kids (hula hooping, anyone?), social media contests, or introductory classes. Look at what\u2019s available around you and what appeals to your visitors the most. Then take things from there.\nUrgency is an extremely powerful psychological trigger. Use trigger words like, \u201climited time offer\u201d, \u201cact now\u201d and \u201cbook now\u201d to create a sense of urgency.\nToo many options can damage conversions. Stick to one call to action per page.\nHere\u2019s a great example from Jetsetter: It does most of the steps above and is simple and benefit driven.\nIn September 2014, a case study on market segmentation revealed that over 70% of hotels agreed that market segmentation positively influenced hotel revenue.\nWhat Exactly is Market Segmentation?\nEssentially, you\u2019re dividing your potential guests from \u201call travelers\u201d into \u201ctravelers who might want to stay at my hotel.\u201d After that, you\u2019re finding out exactly who your ideal guest is, and how best to talk to them.\nHere\u2019s one of our best guides on segmentation.\nSegmenting your marketing can have a huge impact on your revenue. Just ask online retailer Totes Isotoner. They noticed when shoppers visited their site, they visited one category more than others. So they reached out to those shoppers with a targeted email marketing pitch about their most-viewed category. The results? Their revenue skyrocketed by a shocking 7000% (nope, that\u2019s not a typo).\nTo sum up, landing more bookings doesn\u2019t have to be a nightmare. It just takes a little marketing know-how and some understanding of your guests. By using targeted marketing and special offers you can ramp up your bookings too! What are the best results you\u2019ve got from a special offer you\u2019ve given to guests? Share it with us below.",

    "text": "In a press release last week, the Office of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) announced its position that McDonald\u2019s, USA, LLC is a joint employer of the employees of its franchisees. This signals a dramatic shift in the NLRB\u2019s treatment of franchisors and franchisees as joint employers, single employers or alter egos.\nThe press release noted that 181 cases involving McDonald\u2019s have been filed since November 2012: 68 of which were found to have no merit, 64 of which are currently pending investigation and 43 of which have been found to have merit. According to the General Counsel, \"McDonald\u2019s franchisees and/or McDonald\u2019s, USA, LLC\" will be named as a respondent in the complaints issued by the NLRB in the 43 cases if the parties are unable to reach a settlement. This announcement comes at a time when the NLRB is considering revising the standard it uses to evaluate alleged joint employer relationships. The General Counsel has asked the NLRB to expand the contours of the joint employment test. See Browning-Ferris Industries (Case 32-RC-109684).\nThe General Counsel\u2019s announcement represents yet another effort by the current administration to curry favor with the AFL-CIO by making it easier for unions to organize worksites. Thus, we can expect similar initiatives from other federal agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor reaching the same conclusion (e.g., under the Fair Labor Standards Act and Executive Order 11246, to name a few). However, because the definition of \"employer\" or \"joint employer\" differs from statute to statute, the decision as to each will necessarily turn on the applicable statutory language.\nPresently, the weight of authority under federal anti-discrimination statutes, such as Title VII, rejects joint employer status for franchisors such as McDonald\u2019s. See, e.g. Evans v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., 936 F.2d 1087 (10th Cir. 1991) (considering NLRB factors and holding McDonald\u2019s was not an employer of its franchisee\u2019s employees under Title VII); Alberter v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., 70 F.Supp.2d 1138 (D. Nev. 1999) (same); Gray v. McDonald\u2019s USA, LLC, 874 F.Supp.2d 743 (E.D. Tenn. 2012) (holding McDonald\u2019s was not an employer of its franchisee\u2019s employee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and the state anti-discrimination statute). However, with the federal government and agencies focusing on this issue, that may change. Commonly franchised industries, such as food service and hospitality, will no doubt be watching these developments very closely, as a shift in the law could have significant impact on the entire franchise business model.",

    "text": "The messaging upstart's track record shows why its Spectacles video-recording sunglasses shouldn't be taken lightly, even if big questions remain.\nSnapchat -- or Snap Inc., as it now calls itself -- has become a $20 billion company in the face of constant doubting from consumers and pundits who looked at its messaging app, shook their heads and said something to the effect of \"I don't get it\" or \"This is a gimmick.\"\nThat's worth keeping in mind when reacting to its Spectacles video-recording sunglasses.\nSpectacles, unveiled on Friday evening in a Wall Street Journal column, costs $130, comes in three colors and lets users record up to 10 seconds of video by tapping a button on the glasses. The video is recorded in circular, rather than rectangular, form and is taken by a lens with a relatively wide 115-degree field-of-view.\nAs one would expect, Spectacles uses wireless links to pair with smartphones. Snap founder and CEO Evan Spiegel is trying to downplay near-term expectations for the glasses, referring to them as a toy and promising to take a slow approach to commercializing them. \"It's about us figuring out if it fits into people's lives and seeing how they like it,\" he says.\nStill, it's worth remembering the Snapchat app itself was dismissed as a gimmick -- nothing more than a way for teenagers to share pictures they didn't want their parents to see, and which wouldn't be permanently stored -- not too long ago. The same has held for subsequent features such as the ability to draw and write text on top of shared pictures, the ability to create \"Stories\" whose content vanishes after 24 hours and the ability to add face-altering \"lenses\" to photos and videos.\nIn spite of the frequent derision, Snapchat has grown to have more than 150 million users (more than Twitter (TWTR - Get Report) ), a large portion of whom are in their 20s and 30s rather than just teens. It's also now avidly used as a promotional platform by many celebrities and media firms, and its parent is reportedly aiming for at least $300 million in 2016 revenue.\nBy creating a platform where shared content by and large isn't saved, and where users don't have to worry about likes and comments, Snap has carved out a unique social media and messaging niche and become a thorn in Facebook's (FB - Get Report) side, particularly among younger consumers.\nIf it's able to reach lower price points, win over third-party hardware makers and sidestep the privacy and image concerns that have plagued Alphabet's (GOOGL - Get Report) Google Glass, Spectacles could provide another means of expanding Snap's reach.\nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB or GOOGL? Learn more now.\nLimited as they are right now, Spectacles fulfill one of the goals Google Glass has long had: To let users do things they typically rely on a smartphone for while keeping both of their hands free. As the WSJ writers, \"as you record, your hands are free to pet dogs, hug babies or flail around at a concert. You can reach your arms out to people you're filming, instead of holding your phone up, as Spiegel describes it, 'like a wall in front of your face.'\"\nMoreover, Snap is going to great lengths to avoid having Spectacles viewed as a product for geeks, the way Glass has been -- just see this YouTube video for the glasses if you need proof.\nAt the same time, just as Glass has sought to do much more than record photos and video, Spiegel hints Spectacles could have a larger set of use cases (accessing information? conducting e-commerce transactions?) if they become widely adopted as an image-recording tool.\nUnlike Google with Glass, Snap is taking a bottoms-up approach to the wearables market, creating a cheap, simple device that can take over a core smartphone feature and potentially expanding its feature set in time.\nThe company's decision to simultaneously rename itself Snap is also telling. In addition to providing a more serious-sounding corporate moniker ahead of an expected IPO, the former Snapchat's new name points to a future where the company sees itself less as a provider of ephemeral messaging apps than as a provider of solutions for sharing what people see in the world around them via camera lenses.\nFacebook, which depends so heavily on the photo and video sharing of its users to drive engagement, and whose attempts to create rivals to Snapchat have failed to date, has to be watching carefully. This is particularly true given how the sharing of personally-created content on Facebook news feeds has been pressured by the growing popularity of messaging apps in general.\nFor now, Spectacles is still far more an unfinished experiment by a quirky upstart than a threat to Facebook or anyone else. But that upstart's history of fending off much bigger rivals and striking gold where few expected means it's worth taking seriously.",

Try setting up a local instance of procon with the same plugins, connect it directly to the game server, and point it at the same database. If your local instance works on your normal computer, but not from the layer, you're closer to finding the problem.\nnah, this is fine and perfect.\nas sayd ,it was a experiment to see how far i could push adkats in combo with my lame proconrulz coding skills.",

    "text": "Revolve Clothing, an increasingly popular Los Angeles-based fashion e-commerce business, is the latest such retailer to fall victim to layoffs, even as the company\u2019s profits continue to grow. Earlier this month, Revolve announced a round of layoffs in the photo department of its Cerritos headquarters, and sources who spoke to Jezebel believe the company\u2019s seemingly endless budget for mega influencer events\u2014including a Kim Kardashian appearance in the Hamptons\u2014may be coming at the expense of those jobs.\nTwo Revolve employees (both spoke to me over the phone under the condition of anonymity to avoid penalty) said Revolve co-founder Mike Karanikolas held a meeting on June 17 and announced that the company was laying off the majority of its photo editing team\u2014which is responsible for acquiring and editing photos and editorials that appear on the site\u2014to save on operational costs.\nOne staff member also said people who lost their jobs were offered severance packages that will only be issued if they remain at Revolve until their official termination date, which is months down the line. Some employees will stay on until September, while others will remain until November or January, after which their jobs will be outsourced to workers in another country (two employees, one current and one former, specifically said the Philippines). Employees appear to be cautious about publicly discussing the layoffs to avoid jeopardizing their future severance.\nIn June, we notified a small number of employees that they will likely be let go between the months of September and January, as we shift certain work to a 3rd party provider. All affected employees were provided at least several months advance notice, and all were additionally provided severance packages including salary and health coverage, as well as assistance locating other career opportunities. While fewer than ten employees were affected by the changes, we sympathize with their situation, and are doing our best to assist them going forward.\nWe don\u2019t anticipate any other operational changes of this nature and the company will continue to hire and build the team as the business continues to grow.\nExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE, which employs hundreds of individuals. We generally do not comment on marketing expenditures, but we will say in this case the information reported by the press was inaccurate.\nThe inaccuracy she\u2019s referring to are reports that Kim Kardashian was paid $700,000 to host a Revolve Hamptons event this summer. According to the laid-off employees I spoke to, it\u2019s the optics of excess spending that make the layoffs feel more offensive. Perhaps what\u2019s happening is an overlap of their personal disappointment about losing a job and the natural effects of a company that\u2019s prioritizing public image.\nStill, like other fashion outlets, Revolve relies heavily on celebrities and influencers for a marketing boost. Nicole Richie collaborated on a line, stars like Kendall and Kylie Jenner have sold a collection on their site, and style bloggers are frequently sent on trips to promote the brand. Such events have become the lifeblood of Revolve.\nIn addition to taking care of their travel and accommodations, Revolve gifted each influencer with a sizable clothing credit \u2014 a source close to the participating talent tells us $2,000 is standard \u2014 in addition to paying his or her appearance fee. And for certain agency-backed bloggers, like Bernstein and Bazan, who are both represented by Next Models, this can easily run in the tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe first Revolve employee I spoke to who was part of the layoffs told me the company\u2019s decision to hire Kardashian angered staff members who\u2019d been let go. Kim reportedly spent an hour at the party, where she was seen \u201ctaking numerous selfies with influencers,\u201d Page Six reported.\nAlso in attendance were fashion insiders like stylist Chriselle Lim, blogger Arielle Charnas and DJ Amy Pham.\nGerona responded to my question about the Kardashian event in her email above with: \u201cExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE.\u201d Gerona also declined to comment on how much Kardashian was paid for the event.\nWhy the huge cost for Kardashian\u2019s brief appearance? It\u2019s all part of Revolve\u2019s big picture marketing strategy to show clothes in context so customers aspire to wear them \u2014 and in turn, buy them. (Google recently released a study that found this tactic influences 64 percent of women to make a purchase on their smartphones.) When the brand isn\u2019t hosting parties in the Hamptons, it\u2019s sending fashion bloggers on epic, scenic trips around the world \u2014 Jamaica, Mexico, Croatia, etc. \u2014 dressed in the e-tailer\u2019s latest offerings.\nThe employee estimated that the average photo editor\u2019s salary at Revolve is around $36,000. Some of the laid-off staffers first heard about the Kardashian appearance when a fed-up ex-employee railed about it in a scathing Instagram post and tweet posted on July 19.\nWhen I spoke to Estrada over the phone, he said the photo editing team at Revolve is responsible for \u201cpretty much about 95 percent of the website\u201d and that employees who were laid off but still working\u2014some of whom he\u2019s remained friends with and have expressed grievances to him, he says\u2014have been tasked with making the outsourcing a smooth transition.\nWhen asked whether the recent layoffs could simply be viewed as a common, unfortunate result of a growing company\u2019s bureaucratic decisions, Estrada noted that cost-cutting could have been directed elsewhere.\nUPDATE (3:40 p.m.): This post has been updated with additional comments from Revolve\u2019s brand and marketing rep Raissa Gerona.",

    "text": "In my opinion, two of the most profound phrases in the Bible - phrases which express the human condition and determine our destiny throughout the ages - were uttered by none other than one of the ultimate \u2018bad guys\u2019 in the Bible, Pontius Pilate.\nIn his discussion with/interrogation of Jesus, Pilate uttered (rhetorically), the first of those two phrases, \u201cWhat is \u2018truth\u2019?\u201d, in John 18:38. Has that not been a question and issue that has vexed the \u2018enlightened\u2019 throughout history?\nHow each person answers that question determines his or her eternal destiny.\nThere are all kinds of ways people can (and do) answer that question: \u2018He was a good man\u2019, \u2018He was a prophet\u2019, \u2018He was a great teacher\u2019, \u2018He was a role model\u2019, \u2018He showed us how to live and how to treat others\u2019, etc. While those answers aren\u2019t wrong, they are woefully incomplete and inadequate.\nThere were also all kinds of responses in the minds of those standing there that day when Pilate pronounced, \u201cBehold the man!\u201d Some would have thought Him to be the defeated leader of an insurrection; others considered Him a common criminal; others couldn\u2019t even recognize Him as someone they had known (due to His injuries); some would have considered Him a \u2018scapegoat\u2019 of sorts to get the government off their backs; some considered Him a personal liability and sought to sever any ties to Him; some looked at Him as a dreamer who failed; some considered Him to be a \u2018hope\u2019 that didn\u2019t \u2018pan out\u2019.\nBut those are not the kinds of responses those people had when Pilate said, \u2018Behold the man\u2019.

    "text": "CANADA \u2013 Edmonton - Archeologists have uncovered a palisade trench on the Epcor grounds that for the first time pinpoints the location of one of the early Edmonton fur trading forts. \u201cThat would make it one of the earliest non-native structures in the City of Edmonton,\u201d said archeologist Nancy Saxberg, who excavated under the concrete floor of a 1950s machine shop in May and July as part of the expansion of the Epcor water offices and decommissioning of the power plant in the downtown river valley. What she found isn\u2019t much to look at \u2014 a 50 centimetre-wide line of disturbed soil in a layer of silty, light-coloured sub soil that was ground level at the time of the fur traders. But it\u2019s definitely a man-made trench and far too wide to be part of a house or other building, she said. It varied in depth from about 80 centimetres to one metre, with clear steps between them. Fur traders first arrived in the Edmonton area in about 1795, when the twin forts Edmonton House of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company and Fort Augustus of the Northwest Company, were built just across the river from what is now Fort Saskatchewan. The fur traders pulled up the stakes and moved both forts to the Rossdale flats at the beginning of the 1800s. Few details are known about the reasons for the move since the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company journals for those years were lost, Saxberg said.\nUSA \u2013 San Francisco - The long-buried skeleton of colonial San Francisco is being brought to the surface at the site of the old Spanish fort in Yerba Buena, where California as we know it was born. Archaeologists for the Presidio Trust are building interpretive replicas of the ruins of El Presidio de San Francisco directly above the famous garrison's original stone and adobe walls. The displays will use the exact same construction methods and, where possible, materials that were used in the historic 1815 expansion of El Presidio, the ruins of which were recently uncovered. The foundation walls of the Spanish fort were discovered by the Army as it prepared for the 1994 transfer of the Presidio to the National Park Service. Workers were attempting to remove underground heating fuel tanks from a row of houses on Funston Avenue when they found stonework running along the backyards. The walls were outside the boundaries of the original 1776 garrison built by the Spanish, but subsequent archival work revealed that El Presidio had been rebuilt in 1815 after the original structure was severely damaged during earthquakes in 1808 and 1812.\nROYAUME UNI \u2013 Papcastle - Almost \u00a3400,000 has been secured to fund a major excavation of a key Roman settlement unearthed during the 2009 floods. The discovery, at Papcastle, near Cockermouth, is one of the largest Romano-British settlements ever found in northern England. The well-preserved remains of a Roman Settlement were revealed in the aftermath of the November 2009 floods that devastated Cockermouth. The Roman fort at Papcastle was known to the Romans as Derventio. Although the fort site has been subject to excavation in the past, the full extent of the associated settlement lay undiscovered until the floods of 2009, which brought a wealth of Roman artefacts to the surface. These finds prompted Grampus Heritage to undertake an initial community archaeology survey, confirming that Derventio was far more extensive than previously thought. These limited excavations revealed substantial stone and wooden buildings, roads and enclosures as well as many Roman artefacts including pottery, metalwork, coins and glass. The discovery of the most complete Roman water mill yet recorded in Britain was a major highlight.\nSYRIE \u2013 Alep - Clashes between rebels and government forces in the ancient Citadel of Aleppo, a UN World Heritage site, damaged one of the stone footbridges that lead into the fortress, eyewitnesses in the embattled city said on Friday. Syrian archeologists today published photos and a video of the damage to the Citadel on their Arab-language Facebook page titled Syria's Endangered Archeological Heritage. The video shows Syrian government tanks lining up at the Citadel, and a group of soldiers crossing the damaged footbridge into the fort near its first guard tower. The Syrian National Council, which is the main opposition platform within Syria and abroad, today accused government forces of damaging an unspecified section of the Citadel with mortar fire. But according to Strasbourg-based Syrian archeologist Ali Cheikmoush, who is documenting and denouncing the damage being inflicted on Syria's monuments, the footbridge was damaged in a raid by Free Syrian Army insurgents, who blew up one of the gates to get into the fort in search of snipers.\nUSA \u2013 Lower Elwha - Lower Elwha Klallam people stood at their sacred creation site last month for the first time in nearly a century, the tribe announced last week. In addition, the park service also reported finding a site in a nearby location that documents human use as far back as 8,000 years ago, establishing it as one of the oldest known archaeological sites on the Olympic Peninsula. The creation site is a rock with two deep depressions that was covered by water behind the Elwha Dam after it was built in 1913. Oral tradition and recorded reports dating as far back as 1919 describe the rock as the place where the Creator bathed and blessed the Klallam people and other tribes, said Jamie Valadez, Klallam language instructor. Radiocarbon analysis of a second \u201cculturally sensitive site\u201d found recently on the Elwha River showed that people had lived there as far back as 8,000 years ago, according to Olympic National Park officials. The second discovery is one of the oldest known archaeological sites on the Olympic Peninsula, the park said. Material from the second site was collected for further study, and the site was reburied. Like the creation site, it was recently discovered in an area that had been covered by one of the two lakes that had been behind the dams.",

Larson, professor of physics and dean of the Penn State Eberly College of Science. \"The core programs in all of the seven academic departments in the college -- Astronomy and Astrophysics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics -- have risen dramatically in the NRC rankings since it last published such a report 15 years ago,\" he said.\nPenn State Plant Biology, an intercollege program, is tops in the nation in the new National Research Council rankings, as illustrated by this graph, in which the blue oval shows the performance range for Penn State Plant Biology at the highest-ranked position. The performance ranges for all the other 117 plant science programs ranked by the National Research Council are illustrated with green ovals. Image credit: David Hunter, Penn State.\nTo see more graphs showing how other Penn State Science programs performed, click here.\nThe National Research Council study specifically ranks graduate programs, and it incorporates measures of student quality and success in those programs. It also is widely viewed as a review of faculty quality and research productivity -- both of which are very important for undergraduate programs as well. The report positions individual doctoral programs within a range of quality as gauged by two different ranking methods -- dubbed \"R\" and \"S\" rankings. The two ranking methods assigned different levels of importance to 20 characteristics, including the number of research publications per faculty member, the number of times a faculty member's publications have been cited in the research publications of other scientists, the percentage of faculty members whose research is supported by competitive grants, the number of Ph.D. graduates, and the median time to degree. Measures of faculty and student diversity and student support are also included. The report gives each program a ranking range, rather than a simple ranked list, to reflect the statistical confidence range in the results. \"In a striking example, the report's ranking range for Penn State Plant Biology using the S ranking methodology is #1 to #3 among 116 doctoral-level plant-science programs nationwide. This narrow range places Penn State Plant Biology as tops in the nation, as compared with other high-ranking programs including the University of California at Berkeley (with a range from #1 to #6) and Cornell University (with a range from #1 to #8),\" Larson said.\nSimple rankings -- rather than ranges -- can be obtained from the National Research Council data, using the tools at <http://www.phds.org>, a website suggested by the National Academies Press. \"A conservative approach of equal weighting of the National Research Council's R and S methodologies shows that our Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics rose from #21 in the 1995 NRC report to #5 in 2010, our Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology rose from #45 to #25, our Department of Chemistry rose from being tied for the #18 spot to #12, our Department of Mathematics rose from #37 to #8, our Department of Physics rose from #55 to #11, our Department of Statistics rose from #19 to #11, and our Department of Biology, not directly ranked in the 1995 study, comes out at #11,\" Larson said. \"A simpler analysis based on the midpoints of the R and S ranges given in the National Research Council report produces very similar results,\" he added.\nApplying similar analyses to the National Research Council ranges for all the top universities in the study reveals that there is a group of six elite universities in the basic sciences: Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, MIT, Caltech, and Stanford, and that this group is followed immediately by Penn State Science. \"While we were well aware of substantial improvements in our programs, I was surprised to find that, no matter how I analyzed the relative positions of the best-ranked science programs in the nation, our college consistently ranks right at or near the top of the next-tier grouping and unambiguously is in the top ten nationwide,\" Larson said.\nPenn State programs in other areas, particularly in the College of the Liberal Arts, made impressive gains in the National Research Council rankings as well. \"Penn State's rising stature among U.S. and world universities is now officially recognized with the publication of the National Research Council study.,\" Henry C. Foley, Penn State's Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School, said. \"This new report confirms what we already know from many other measures, and that is that Penn State has continued to strive for and to achieve scholarly and research excellence over the last 15 years. In that time, we have gone from what was a very good university to a truly great university.\"",

I own 4 shops and use to give them my business and send all my customers there but thanks to her I started giving my business to NAPA. I have watched her be rude to nearly everyone that walks in that store , she should be ashamed to wear the manager title and corporate she be ashamed to have her employed there ,She must really need that dead in job because there is no way anyone will hire her big behind anywhere else. If I could give a big - 0 as my rating I would but even that would be to good for that location. She need to be dealt with by upper management.\nThese guys do awesome work. I would recommend their work to anyone. They have done work on my truck, my wife's car, and my mothers car. I trust them with it all.",

These courses are available primarily to students on the MSc International Relations and MSc in International Relations (Research) and the MSc EU Politics.\nOver the past sixty years, the evolution of the European Union as an 'international actor' has been striking. The European Community of the 1950s and 1960s had some relations with third countries, namely former European colonies, and was beginning to assert a common stance in international trade negotiations. The European Union of the early 21st century conducts economic and political relations with virtually every country on earth, is a major player in international trade negotiations, is one of the world's most generous aid donors, and proclaims its pursuit of a common foreign, security and defence policy. Yet there are also serious obstacles to the formation of efficient and effective policies towards the rest of the world: notably, the views of the 27 EU member states have to be molded into a coherent EU position.\nThe entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty raised expectations that the EU will be better equipped to formulate and implement common foreign policies commensurate with the EU's economic strengths. This is because the Lisbon Treaty altered the institutional set-up for foreign policy-making within the EU.\nThe EU forms part of a complex 'foreign policy system', composed of the European Union as well as the member states' foreign policies (which both affect, and are affected by, the EU). The EU itself is made up of two 'pillars', each with different decision-making rules and institutions: the European Community (the 'first pillar', which now includes Justice and Home Affairs) and the Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy (the 'second pillar'). These separate policy-making frameworks lead to problems of consistency and coordination. The Lisbon Treaty attempted to solve some of these problems, by creating a European External Action Service and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. These new institutions are meant to 'straddle' the separate policy-making frameworks, and thus presumably lead to more consistent, efficient and effective foreign policies.\nThe relationship between institutions and policies, however, is not clear-cut. To what extent does the development of institutions lead to a stronger EU role in the world? Or do other factors matter more? For the last forty years, the member states have continuously developed mechanisms and institutions for conducting external relations. But at the same time, they have sought to retain control over the process, and jealously guard their own autonomy in the sphere of foreign policy. This tension, between the drive to act collectively on the world stage and the desire to retain national autonomy, has shaped the institutions developed in the external relations field, as well as the outcomes produced by those institutions. There is thus a complex interplay between institutions, member state preferences and interests, and outcomes.",

    "text": "Strolling between the trees along the sound of the rushing water, Ben was in true form expressing his pleasure at being there.\nHe marveled at Nora racing around in her independence, off leash and free, disappearing, and then appearing from behind, charging past us at full speed. We shared the awe of her beauty when she would stand still for just a moment, Ben urging me to capture this beauty with the camera.\nHe loved following along the path that has become so familiar now, listening to my explanation of things, the magic of the light on the water and beauty growing there too.\nI don\u2019t know what possessed me to add with emphasis at one point, \u201cand this is all our land!\u201d A presumptuous statement all by itself of course. I was still walking, but Ben had stopped when hearing this and literally broke into song, belting out his own improvisational version of the 1940\u2019s song made famous by Woodie Guthrie, \u201cThis is Our Land, this is Your land, from Worth-ing-ton, to the trees and water\u2026this land was made for you and Me!\u201d Oh, never a dull heartfelt moment with this gorgeous young man!\nIf I had fallen into any aspect of losing perspective, or into complacency born of entitlement, or forgotten what gratitude felt like, well, this moment brought me right back to just how rich we are, and how lucky I am to be both inhabitant and steward of this beautiful land, and how important it feels to be sharing it with others in any way I can. Happy Independence Day indeed.\nOn the way back up the path, Ben says he wants to come back tomorrow and do this hike again! Smile. We come to the fork, two ways to complete a loop to the starting point. I ask him if he\u2019d like to go \u2018this way\u2019 today to see the heart of what we are. This fork is a direct path to the giant piece of rose quartz that occupies the center of this property. Happening upon this alignment recently added fresh meaning to the magic I already know lives here.\nMoving closer to this venerable presence, as if to accentuate the point, the heart shows itself literally as heart inscribed into it\u2019s surface.\nand waited for the moment when we could capture her wild beauty on film once again.\nI can just imagine Ben belting out that song \u2014 What a treasure he is and adjuster of perspective!",

This year, I'm keeping the kids busy with this fun Printable Thanksgiving BINGO Set. Instead of having them underfoot asking me when it will be time to eat, I plan to have this printed and ready to go!\nThere are 10 different BINGO cards, so if you have more players than that, print extra cards, and be sure to have extra prizes!\nYou'll need to cut out the calling card squares \u2013 there are 32 of them. This is what is used to call out the square for the kids to mark. The kids can take turns being the caller, or maybe one of the older kids or grown ups will help out.\nBe sure to download both parts!\nTo cover the squares when a picture is called, you can use flat clear marbles or even colorful fall candies like M&M's! And bonus, getting little ones to use that pincher grip is a great way to strengthen their hand muscles.\nYou could even get really fancy and laminate the cards. Then, the kids can use washable dot markers to mark their cards and wipe away when the game is over.",

    "text": "My journey to the Middle Earth begins on a 9 hour flight from Manila to Auckland. Which, if I must say \u2013 is short compared to the long haul trips I have been taking the past few months. 2 hours drive from the Airport to The Hobbiton Shire, indulging the fact that the rules of the road here in New Zealand are in complete reverse as opposed to my home country. Drivers are on the right, slow lanes are on the left. Needless I say more that driving in New Zealand feels like learning how to drive for the very first time. Doing so while taking a 170 km journey to the Shire. All encompassing my will and determination to try and drive in this foreign country.\nThe Hobbiton is nothing but a mere movie set producers spent millions on last 2007. Which if you\u2019ve read or watched the trilogy \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d or are familiar with the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d; it must have been a dream come true coming here. I, on the other-hand, am not a huge fan. Being a book worm myself, I have yet to read the pages of the The Hobbit.\nMy curiosity rose when I learned that dwarfs are midget living under hills of a Hobbit hole. As per our tourist guide, Bethany, the more windows they have; the wealthier they are; and the more taxes they pay. I wondered so vividly before coming to the set \u2013 if I \u2013 as an Asian; would fit perfectly through that Hobbit hole. There I learned that there are 2 types of Hobbit Hole ever created. 60% and the 90%. Apparently, camera tricks deceives us from thinking that the Hobbits are short as they should be. And actors are the mere determinant if their height deemed fit to which hole. 60% for actors not tall enough, and 90% for those who are. Giving us an illusion that Hobbits are actually tiny creatures compared to Wizards and Dwarfs.\nWe were served complimentary drinks inside the Green Dragon. I opted to order the non-alcoholic ginger beer (since I was with my parents lol) which basically is a regular ginger ale. We were also given a chance to dress up in Hobbit costume \u2013 giving us the nostalgic feels deemed fit for a fan. Or to the wanna be fan.\n11 hours to finally reach The Hobbiton Shire is a long time! Power to you for bearing it all for the gorgeous view. I love how there\u2019s so much greenery around you. That\u2019s a really interesting fact about Hobbits! Hope you had fun :).",

For others it might be keeping track of your progress in various images.\nBut for Jackie, the way that she has kept herself motivated, through all of the jujitsu training, F45 and even the fad bacon diet, was by holding on to a dress that she loved from her past.\nMany people might remember the dress from an old Kyle and Jackie O promo and in Jackie\u2019s eyes it was the one outfit that she thought made her look and feel her absolute best. Jackie called it her \u2018goal weight dress\u2019 because it was the one item of clothing that would make her feel accomplished if she could still fit into it.\n\u201cWhen was the last time you think, we\u2019re going back years, you realised it wouldn\u2019t zip up and it\u2019s never been worn since?\u201d, asked Kyle.\n\u201cLike ten years ago or something,\u201d replied Jackie.\nOf course, anyone would be a bit nervous to try on a piece of clothing that they haven\u2019t squeezed into for a whole DECADE!!

And this will lead to significant annual loss of local budgets. Only Kharkiv will not get enough about UAH 17 million, which is 17,5% of the budget revenues of the city.\n\"The Cabinet of Ministers did not provide proper financial and economic calculations and proposals on sources of coverage of losses of local budget revenues, which contradicts Part 3, Article 142 of the Constitution of Ukraine, according to which the expenditures of local self-government bodies that arose as a result of decisions of state authorities are compensated by the state,\" \u2013 stated in Mr. Pysarenko's appeal to Groysman.\nThe MP assures that the initiative proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers will not find support in the Parliament.

This week we are teaming up with LAND O LAKES\u00ae to create Simple and Fresh Summer Recipes using their new product, LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt.\nAbout LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt: LAND O LAKES\u00ae is expanding its popular line of half-stick butter with the introduction of LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt. This new product contains wholesome ingredients: sweet cream, olive oil and sea salt. LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt is an easy and convenient way to simply enhance the flavor of your favorite foods. Available in a premeasured half-stick size, this new product can be used for topping and cooking a variety of foods, combining the two ingredients consumers often combine separately when frying or saut\u00e9ing foods. The delicious taste of butter and olive oil will add delicious flavor to any dish.\nThe recipe I chose comes from one of my favorite cuisines, Indian. My favorite recipe by far is my Indian Butter Chicken (Chicken Makhani) but this recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala is just as fabulous and so much easier to prepare!\nI grilled the marinated chicken on skewers which gave it such a wonderful flavor! When summer rolls around, I just want to grill everything! You could either grill on an outdoor or indoor grill.\nIn a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, 1 teaspoon garam masala, cayenne, black pepper, and ginger. Stir in chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour and up to 24 hours.\nMelt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saut\u00e9 garlic and jalapeno for 1 minute. Season with 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and 1 teaspoon garam masala. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. Add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste for salt. Transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with fresh cilantro if you\u2019d like.\n*If not using LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt, you may need a bit additional salt.\nThis recipe is pretty spicy (just the way I like it). If you don\u2019t like things as spicy, use less or omit the cayenne pepper and/or ground black pepper.\nAnd now to the GIVEAWAY! One lucky reader will receive a coupon for a free package of LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt! All you have to do is answer this question: What is your favorite recipe made with Butter?\nA winner will be chosen by random on Wednesday, June 13th at 9:00AM PST.\nI received a full-value coupon redeemable for LAND O LAKES\u00ae Butter with Olive Oil & Sea Salt, for recipe development and review purposes. All opinions are my own.\nI LOVE chicken tika masala and haven't made it in forever! Yours looks awesome - great choice for this week's theme!\nYour chicken tika masala looks amazingly delicious!\nThe chicken in this dish looks AMAZING!!! I'm pinning this one for me to make sometime soon!\nChicken Tikka Masala is one of my very favorite things to eat.

But this does look very yummy!\nAwesome Recipe! My family will love this recipe and I can't wait to give it a try!

    "text": "Most autochromes do seem to have the authority of art \u2013 that power to rivet our gaze and demand of our eyes that they return again and again, and the power to reward those returns with pleasure and insight. It would be interesting to know what it is about the autochrome that so compels, to know why that soft glow of suggestion, of elegant ladies in lace, of nuance and the Monet-haze of dream is so emotionally gripping, so psychologically arresting.\nAlfonse Van Besten, Symphony in white, 1912 autochrome 9 x 12cm.\nAround 1890 a number of amateur photographers were dissatisfied with the mere technical merits of photography. They wished to use photography for reproducing beauty and expressing their inner feelings and thoughts. Their vision had been opposed by painters and art critics, who were of the opinion that photography, being the product of a technical device, did not belong in a museum. The invention of a \u201cfuzzy rendering process\u201d, and the introduction of the manipulated image moved photography closer to the contemporary art movements in painting. Previous objections, to allow photography into the holy sanctuaries of museums, gradually disappeared.\nIn 1895 the Koninklijke Musea voor Kunst en Geschiedenis in Brussels started collecting international art photography. Among the foremost Belgian pictorialists from around 1900 were Hector Collard, Alexandre, Edmond Sacr\u00e9, Gustave Marissiaux, L\u00e9onard Misonne and Edouard Hannon. Like genuine impressionists they were captivated by light, atmosphere and colour.\n( From the exposition catalogue \u201cDe fotografie in Belgi\u00eb 1839 \u2013 1940\u201d at the Provinciaal Museum voor Kunstambachten, Deurne, 1970).\nIt was not until 1907 that colour photography, thanks to the autochrome process, came within the reach of photographers. But from among the above mentioned Belgian photographers, it was only Gustave Marissiaux who fully started to make use of the new technique. Whether his fellow pictorialists have ever applied the autochrome process is uncertain: were they disappointed by the fact that the new technique, in contrast to other known photographic techniques, was impossible to manipulate?\nFor most of us it is quite a surprise to realise that even before the first world war photographing in colour was possible. This was due to the autochrome process invented during the years 1895-1903, by the French brothers Louis Lumi\u00e8re (1864-1947 and Auguste Lumi\u00e8re (1862-1954). It took them four further years to work out and refine the several fabrication processes. Finally in 1907 the autochrome plates came on the market and were an instant succes. Until now, the photographers\u2019 only way to produce colour was tinting the plates by hand which was done by many photographers with breathtaking artistry. E.g.the beach scene below is a hand coloured example of a plate coloured by the Belgian amateur photographer Constant Casters, who had a very refined hand and taste.\nThe nucleus of autochrome plates are dyed grains of potatoe starch measuring between 0,006-0,025mm.\nMake a mix of these three different coloured grain starches.\nYou need a glassplate between 0,9 and 1,8mm thick.\nBlow the coloured mix of grains on the varnished plate.\nThe whole plate then has to be pressed to reduce overall thinkness of layers.\nAfter pressing apply a second layer of varnish.\nThere are between 6000 to 7000 grains on a square millimeter.\nA rolling pressure of 5000kg per square centimetre had to be achieved to press the layers without breaking the fragile glass plate.\nAround 1914 the daily outlet was 6000 autochrome plates.\nThe biggest collection of autochromes (72.000 plates) is housed at the Albert Kahn Museum at Boulogne Billancourt/France.\nto view a note on the photographer and his autochromes.",

    "text": "24 Signs You Are the Laziest Person in Your Friends' Circle!\n\u201cDoing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing\u201d is the Zen way to go. Why follow the crowd who pretend to be busy, when they\u2019re actually not doing anything? When others call you lazy, just throw this at them. And if you have any acceptance issues, this list should help you embrace your true self. Here are some signs that you are the laziest person in your friends' circle.\n1. You\u2019re never the one to make plans to go out and party.\n2. Why cook food when you can order it?\n3. Your friends don\u2019t expect you to ever show up for any scene on time.\n4. You\u2019re a pro at delegating work so that you never do anything yourself!\n5. During the day, sleep is your best activity.\n6. You prefer other people feeding you. Feeding yourself is quite stressful!\n7. Contemplating whether you should get off the couch and take a shower is a common occurrence. The couch always wins!\n8. Your mother constantly complains about how you keep asking her to make chai or coffee or sandwiches or French fries!\n9. Internet shopping is God\u2019s gift to YOU.\n10. You will drive around forever to get a parking spot that is as close to the entrance as possible. Who wants to walk that much?!\n11. Winter is when you hibernate, because who is going to actually make the effort of getting out of bed, putting on layers of clothing or attending college classes?\n12. You\u2019d rather watch the same, boring channel forever instead of getting up and finding the remote.\n13. You often scream for your mom/ roommate to get up from whatever they are doing and come and switch on the fan for you.\n14. You never take notes in class and depend on the photocopies you make of other\u2019s notebooks.\n15. People never ask you to organize a friend\u2019s birthday party because they worry that it won't get done.\n16. You strongly believe that driving is cool, but having your own driver to take you around town is even cooler!\n17. Instead of personally wishing your friends on their birthday, you\u2019d rather send your love via Facebook.\n18. Your feet have become super-dextrous because it\u2019s so much easier to pick things up with your toes rather than bending down or changing your position.\n19. The last time you played an outdoor sport was virtually on your Xbox/ Wii.\n20. You don\u2019t have a Voter ID card because you were too lazy to go get your photo clicked at the booth.\n21. Sweatpants and PJs are what you call \"fashionable\" because dressing up is such an effort!\n22. You can often be found taking a relaxing nap after a tiring meal or bath!\n23. You don\u2019t throw parties, you only attend them. Maybe. If you feel like it.\n24. You\u2019ve trained your dog to \"fetch\" stuff you need!\nMUST-READ: 5-Minute Salad Recipes For Lazy Girls MUST-READ: The Lazy Girl\u2019s Guide to Draping a Sari Like a Hindi Film Heroine!",

    "text": "I\u2019m pretty excited for the Microsoft Kinect. Motion-sensing gaming with no controller! Sounds great, right?\nAnd I\u2019m sure it will be really, really fun. I\u2019m excited to see all the different ways game designers use the technology. But the other day I was showing some of these videos to my wife, and I could tell we were both thinking the exact same thing. In addition to being really, really fun, this is going to really, really embarrassing.\nThis is a perfect summertime song! Where was this song all summer?!\nThis is one of the catchiest songs I\u2019ve heard in a long time, which is unfortunate, because I\u2019m obviously going to sing it out loud in an inappropriate situation at some point. Like when my sister was gardening and loudly singing the Lily Allen song of the same name.\nI purchased this album based solely on the fact that I heard it was produced by one of the guys from Grizzly Bear. That\u2019s really embarrassing, right? It turned out to be a great move, though.\nI\u2019m actually excited about streaming something on Netflix!\nDon\u2019t let the title of this post fool you. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve never enjoyed streaming something through Netflix; that\u2019s a feature I use regularly. It\u2019s just that it seems like nothing I\u2019m ever really, really excited about watching is available. I always decide I want to kill some time by streaming something and then struggle to find something worth watching, as opposed to deciding what I want to watch and then being pleasantly surprised by its instant availability.\nWhat is going on with Sesame Street?\nI didn\u2019t watch a whole lot of Sesame Street growing up, so for all I know, it\u2019s always been this weird. But I keep stumbling on these strange videos from the show.\nFirst came the Katy Perry collaboration, which, while still available online, was pulled out of the television episode in which it was supposed to appear.\nI mean, I know they\u2019ve done stuff like this before (I fondly recall Feist\u2019s appearance from a couple of years ago), but Katy Perry seems like an odd choice. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m a fan of hers, and I don\u2019t really think there is anything wrong with this. But as soon as I saw her outfit and thought for a second about the unaltered lyrics of her honestly-not-Sesame-Street-appropriate songs I knew that people would be up in arms about it. Don\u2019t the good folks over at the Children\u2019s Television Workshop know how much people love to have fits of hyperventilation about stuff like this?\nThen today I saw their parody of True Blood. It\u2019s more benign than the Katy Perry performance, I guess, although I\u2019m sure people can find something in it to complain about (vague vampire references = sacrilegious?). I was more just baffled by it.\nI mean, I guess ostensibly we\u2019re learning about rhyming? Is that the point? All I really took away from it was that grouches like mud. I know they know more about education than I ever will, but it seems like we might be worrying too much about entertaining the adults watching along with their children here.\nThis job is more my speed than the last one.\nHey, if anyone knows how I can get a job in London with smart, attractive, interesting people making cool videos with an iPad, shoot me an email. Thanks in advance!\nSeriously, I know great places near here to get lunch and everything.\nI have different DNA than people who do this for a living.\nSo, this has been floating around the internet for the past couple of days, and I have been doing my best to avoid it, knowing how I would react. I finally broke down and watched it today, and I don\u2019t know what to say other than I feel a deep sense of shame after having my stomach reduced to a quivering, frightened mess by a YouTube video.\nIn the least surprising news of all time, Blockbuster, Inc. is declaring bankruptcy. As of now all of the talk is about debt restructuring and the like, but this is clearly a company at death\u2019s door. With Netflix and iTunes and (the still sort of mystifying to me) Redbox, we all knew this was coming for the better part of a decade, right?",

    "text": "Katie Summerhayes was born and brought up in Sheffield; she recalls her first introduction to her childhood idol with a lot of embarrassment during the summer of 2012. She had just turned 16 and had visited the English Institute of Sports at Sheffield for the school sports day; it was then that Jessica Ennis Hill was preparing for the Olympics to be held at London. It was just the torch relay that Summerhayes had a chance to run for due to her potential; it was her Olympic connection that the teachers had pushed her to the front row and introduce herself to the poster girl of London 2012.\nSummerhayes is supposed to share a similar pedestal at the (Rosa Khutor Extreme Park) with her childhood idol is she succeeds in living up to her potential in the ski slope-style competition; it\u2019s probably a nice opportunity for her fans to see the Olympic medal around her neck.\nJust a month ahead, she had been to Russia following her Gstaad World Cup triumph, even through she\u2019d just 18 years old. It took 19 years for a British woman to win a World Cup skiing medal in Summerhayes; she truly lived up to her reputation earned during the previous season when she performed at the Swiss resort of Silvaplana.\nIn the face of adversities and a series of injuries there\u2019s this story of courage and determination lying between the two outcomes. It has a close resemblance with the comeback of Ennis Hill, wherein the champion overcame stress fractures that threatened her career; Ennis also depicted enormous courage to live through the challenges and get crowned as the Olympic Heptathlon champion.\nSummerhayes had to experience rehabilitation for nine months after she used one of the hamstrings to undergo a reconstructive surgery; it was only after this that she was able to get back to the slopes at the beginning of 2013. Her position was consolidated yet again once she stood fourth at the World championships and obtained a major breakthrough at the World Cup.\nSummerhayes had a tough time when she had to rest for a minimum of six months following a failure of her initial operation; she was shocked when her medical specialist had shared the possibility of another surgery using the other hamstring belonging to the other leg; she only had about nine months to prepare for the Sochi Olympics. Her coach Pat Sharples never got disheartened and encouraged her through the rough patches.\nAttending the Bath conference in August was a turning point that she keeps recalling very often. Just about a month back Summerhayes had returned to Colorado for competing at a World Cup event completing her stay in the weights room within Sheffield Hallam University and Bisham Abbey. She was thankful to be on her skis again, although she didn\u2019t succeed with her latest runs.\nThe Gstaad competition took place soon after her remarkable recovery; she acquired the second position behind Lisa Zimmerman of Germany and bagged the World Cup silver. It was just her second competition, and a real morale booster for her. She was indeed very happy to have proven her worth to herself.\nA dry slope was all that introduced Katie Summerhayes to this sport like her fellow team member Jenny Jones. She was only six years old when she first wore her pair of skis in the Sheffield Ski Village. This was the same slope wherein James Woods, her GB teammate grew up to become a powerful contender for the ski slope-style medal for men. Will the Sheffield residents see another ski village coming up following the triumph of Summerhayes. These games are often about the legacy that you carry.",

    "text": "The first one to be published out of the eleven books the Drenai Series contains, David Gemmell\u2019s Legend, which hit the shelves in 1984, takes us for a trip in Drenai, a medieval nation which sees its peace being disturbed by an unexpected enemy.\nThe story revolves around Druss, a legendary axe-wielding warrior considered a hero in the whole nation, who has to help defend Dros Delnoch, a fortress turned city during the times of peace, from the newly unified Nadir tribes. One of Gemmell\u2019s many strengths is that of being able to address a contemporary matter, namely xenophobia and the fear of the unknown, in a fantasy setting which still instils a sense of realism. The plot is admirably well-constructed, making the book impossible to put down.\nWhereas Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the rings focuses on the repercussions of the people\u2019s action on the destiny of the world, Legend does the exact opposite and observes how people are affected by what\u2019s happening. Gemmell has unparalleled mastery when it comes to creating strong characters to which we can relate and have empathy for. The relationships the protagonists nurture are undoubtedly what makes the novel special; indeed, light is not only shed on the main character, but also on everyone that surrounds him.\nIn addition to that, what\u2019s truly riveting about Gemmell\u2019s work is how all the parts of his saga work together. The actions may well take place thousands of years apart from each other, but the author does a brilliant job in keeping the whole plot coherent and a pleasure to follow. When starting a new book, in fact, it feels as if you\u2019re greeting the characters like old friends you have not seen for a while.\nTo wrap it up, I unreservedly recommend this book to everyone, especially because it stands far away from the hackneyed, teen-oriented heroic fantasy novels mushrooming right now. David Gemmell\u2019s raw and mature style of writing is truly what, in my opinion, makes Legend a page-turner.\nNils Perrenoud, Cambridge Exam Preparation Course in Malta Student.",

Fortress Gold Group offers a wide selection of beautifully minted silver coins from all our nation\u2019s past. Behind every coin featured is a story, and behind every story is a historical and cultural value that will continue to increase over the years.\nWith a silver content of 90% and a unique historical significance, the Morgan Silver Dollar is a great choice for any coin collector or investor. The Morgan Dollar\u2019s value has undergone an incredible increase since it was discontinued in 1921. The 1895 Morgan Dollar in particular is exceptionally rare and desirable to investors due to the mysterious disappearance of more than 12,000 pieces from that year.\nThis commemorative coin was originally created to celebrate the end of World War I, the same year the Morgan Silver Dollar was discontinued. The last silver dollar ever released by the United States Mint, it has a silver content of 90%. Its rarity, precious metals content, and historical significance make it an exceptional value for any investor.\nMinted from 1916 to 1947, the Walking Liberty Half-Dollar captures the stunning image of Lady Liberty striding towards the sunrise and wearing the American flag. These silver coins became the model for the Silver American Eagle bullion coins.\nMinted from 1948-1963, the Franklin is 90% silver and 10% copper content. Approximately 510 million coins featuring Franklin\u2019s bust on the obverse were minted until a bill from Congress replaced the coin with the Kennedy Half-Dollar after the president\u2019s assassination.\nFollowing the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the United States Mint came out with a commemorative coin for the late president. The Kennedy Half-Dollar coin is comprised of 90% pure silver.",

Can you provide me with a list of your current and past clients?\nSEO agencies must provide a sample of current and former clients as well as some references from these clients. The references will give you an insight into the effectiveness of the agency and whether it has given a positive or negative impact on the search ranking of their clients. Customers can not provide specific analyses but will be able to present data on conversions and get a hearing.\n2. What do you know about the latest Google algorithm updates?\nAny decent SEO agency must be aware of the latest Panda and Penguin updates and other Google search updates to the algorithm as well. These include Link Warnings, DMCA fines and positioning to name a few. The SEO agency should also have the opportunity to explain what these updates are, what they do and why they are something that your business needs to know about.\n3. How will you improve my search engine ranking?\nSEO agencies should discuss their methods of how they will boost the search engine ranking of your website. Agencies should give you an approximate calculation as to when the goals you have given them will be realized. Agencies should offer to undertake a technical review of your site and an on-page optimization process to make your website look as user-friendly as possible.\n4. Do you want to distribute the changes you made to the site?\nSEO means a lot of changes will be made to the code of your web page and the agency you choose must be able to show you the changes that have been made.

    "text": "The big Apple event is tomorrow. By now, it\u2019s pretty much an accepted fact that this event is to announce the iPad 2. Tech sites everywhere are posting all about their speculations of what the iPad 2 will contain. You can see our\u2019s here.\nThe biggest story about this event though, is not just the product that\u2019s being announced\u2026but the person announcing the product. Over the years, people have become accustomed to Steve Jobs announcing the Apple products we all know and love. Among our favorite things is the passion in which Steve announced the products. There was never a product he didn\u2019t seem to back whole-heartedly, 100%. Now, with Jobs\u2019s commonly known health problems and the leave he is on, people are expecting Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CFO and current CEO in place of Jobs, to announce the product.\nLast week, Cook noticeably sat in the \u201cbig seat\u201d for the annual shareholders meeting. Now he\u2019ll have to stand in the big light to announce the product that has created a whole new technology market. One that companies are struggling to compete with. A market that competitors can only hope to match the iPad\u2019s success, not even come close to outdoing it.\nThere is a very, very slim chance that Steve Jobs could announce the iPad 2 but I highly doubt it. However, if he was to announce it, I think that it would turn out to be as big, if not a bigger story than the actual product being announced. We hope Steve is in good health and we hope the next-gen iPad will live up to the expectations of its predecessor. Stay tuned for a full breakdown of the new features tomorrow as well as an analyzation of how it sizes up to the new tablets on the market.",

    "text": "A link to this post, Chocolate and Child Slavery, is embedded in it.\nThe Global Slavery Index provides research for Alliance 8.7 \u2014 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery & Child Labour explaining \u201con any given day in 2016, an estimated 40.3 million people were victims of modern slavery. Of these people, 24.9 million were in forced labour and 15.4 million were in forced marriage.\n\u201cThere are more females (71%) than males (29%) in modern slavery.\n\u201cOne in four victims of modern slavery are children.\n\u201cAt any given time, some 16 million people around the world are victims of forced labour exploitation in the private sector (not including sexual exploitation). On average, they are held 20.5 months before escaping or being freed.\n\u201cAt any given time in 2016, 4.8 million people are victims of forced sexual exploitation. On average, they are held for 23.4 months in their situation before escaping or being freed. The vast majority are women and girls. Children represent more than 20% of the victims.\n\u201cAt any given time in 2016, 4.1 million people around the world are victims of forced labour imposed by state authorities. Some work for years, while many work for only a few weeks.\n\u201cAt any given time in 2016, there are 15.4 million people living in a forced marriage. While men and boys are among the victims, most are women and girls (84%). An estimated 37% of victims living in a forced marriage were children at the time of the marriage. Amongst the child victims, 44% were forced to marry before the age of 15. The youngest victim in the sample was 9 when she was forced to marry.\n\u201cThe rate of modern slavery is highest in Africa, with 7.6 victims for every 1,000 people in the region.\n\u201cWhere victims of forced labour have migrated, most are exploited in a country in the same income-based regional grouping as their home country. But a larger proportion of victims from lower-middle-income regions are exploited in higher-income regions.\n\u201cSlavery is an extreme form of inequality, and exists within a competing matrix of political, economic, societal, cultural and religious pressures. Modern slavery is bound to some of the most complex issues facing world leaders.\n\u201cSlavery has existed in different forms since ancient times. Despite being outlawed in most countries and the abolitionist movement in the 1800s, the crime persists in ways more pervasive and complex than ever.\n\u201cModern slavery refers to situations where one person has taken away another person\u2019s freedom \u2013 their freedom to control their body, their freedom to choose to refuse certain work or to stop working \u2013 so that they can be exploited. Freedom is taken away by threats, violence, coercion, abuse of power and deception.\n\u201cModern slavery is a plain English term. It is not a legal definition.\n\u201cThere are 40.3 million reasons why we must care.\n\u201cGlobalization has brought tangible benefits and positive changes to many across the world. Technological advances have connected the world unlike any other time in history. Consumers are also more socially aware. And still, slavery continues to persist.\n\u201cModern slavery is hidden within the depths of criminal networks, trafficking people for exploitation, and occurs where legitimate industries meet informal economies. Modern slavery comes at a serious cost. Modern slavery suppresses the economy and reduces sustainable development.\n\u201cThere are some who say the problem is too hard, or that there are more pressing issues, or that it is for governments to do more, or that we can never end modern slavery. The Walk Free Foundation and many others believe that these are morally indefensible responses. We can, and we must do everything in our power to end modern slavery.\n\u201cNo one person or organization can end modern slavery.\n\u201cIt is a complex web of criminal behaviour, where sometimes those committing the crimes have turned to cruel and desperate measures to survive themselves.\n\u201cDefinition of supply chain: A supply chain is the network of businesses, people, activities, information and resources involved to produce or distribute goods or deliver services, from a supplier to a customer.\n\u201cWith the rapid acceleration of globalisation, supply chains have exponentially grown, transforming the way businesses conduct cross-border production, investment, trade, and employment. Multinational enterprises are accountable for the majority of international trade. Their supply chains are inherently complex and dynamic supply chains.\n\u201cGlobal supply chains are important as they create employment and opportunities for economic and social development. Yet when poorly managed, the demand for cheap labour, lack of visibility, dynamics of production in informal unregulated markets can have negative implications, including being at high risk for subjecting individuals to modern slavery.\n\u201cWeak institutions and poor enforcement capability in many host production nations means tackling modern slavery is beyond the power of national governments alone.\n\u201cWhile many of these abuses occur in the supply chains of major global corporates, cases of blatant and deliberate corporate abuse are rare. Most do not even know what modern slavery looks like or just how susceptible their own supply chains are to it.\nBelow are groups, helping raise our awareness of and eradicate modern slavery, such as The Stairway Project, a learning and resource centre for children\u2019s rights.\n\u201cThe Stairway Project is a documentary film that tells the story of Stairway Foundation, Inc. An entirely student run shoot, told by seven high school kids from the United States, they get a first-hand look at the harsh social realities that impact and impel children to take to the streets.\n\u201cThe students also follow the daily cycle of activities of the children in the Stairway\u2019s Family Home Program as well as Stairway\u2019s Advocacy and Training Program that covers all of the Philippines and several other countries in South and South East Asia.\nThe Stairway Project has also made a series of YouTubes to help break the silence of sexual abuse of children.\n\u201cNearly everything we consume \u2014 from clothing, to the batteries in our cell phones, to the fish we eat \u2014 has forced labor and exploitation hidden somewhere inside its production.\n\u201cMany of us, including the businesses who make the products we buy, have no idea when or where the exploitation occurs.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s growing every single day.\n\u201cAbout 45.8 million people today are living in slave-like conditions. That\u2019s bigger than the population of California, Canada, or Argentina.\n\u201cNearly every country on earth is affected, including the United States.\nNot For Sale has developed a scholarship program to provide housing, school fees, supplies and emotional support for vulnerable children in rural parts of Peru.\nfor the elimination of slavery on Gaia.",

    "text": "2. The first and the only worthwhile inquiry is to know: \u201cWho am I within this body-mind mechanism? What is this consciousness, this miracle of consciousness?\u201d This miracle of awareness has to be discovered. You have to peel your being as one peels an onion. Go on peeling\u2026. You will find layers within layers. And finally, when all the layers are discarded, eliminated, you will find in your hands pure nothingness, emptiness, SHUNYATA. That is your essential core, the center of the cyclone.\n3. You have to learn meditation to enjoy your emptiness. And that is one of the greatest days in life \u2014 when a person starts enjoying emptiness, aloneness, nothingness.\n4. Just finding that \u201cI am nobody\u201d\u2026 and that\u2019s how existence is. What is a marigold flower? What is a rose? They are both nobodies. And we belong with them. Once this settles in you, the idea of nobodiness, silence starts descending on you. There is no idea, no picture \u2014 no Jesus Christ, no Krishna, no Buddha: You are utterly empty. And in this emptiness is the light. In this emptiness is enlightenment.\n5. In English there is no right word, so you have to understand that we are using \u2018meditation\u2019 for dhyana. Dhyana means a state of being where there is no thought, no object, no dream, no desire, nothing \u2014 just emptiness. In that emptiness you come to know your self. You discover the truth. You discover your subjectivity. It is perfect silence.\n6. The most strange thing about the mind is, if you become a watcher it starts disappearing. Just like the light disperses darkness, watchfulness disperses the mind, its thoughts, its whole paraphernalia. So meditation is simply watchfulness, awareness. And that reveals \u2014 it is nothing to do with inventing. It invents nothing; it simply discovers that which is there. And what is there? You enter and you find infinite emptiness, so tremendously beautiful, so silent, so full of light, so fragrant, that you have entered into the kingdom of God. In my words, you have entered into godliness.\n7. No matter what, you are alone. And all the fiction that there may be somebody who is just made for you, there may be somebody who will fill this gap, this emptiness in you\u2026. Nobody can do it; not because nobody wants to do it, no, everybody would love to do it, but it is just not possible in the very nature of things. And it is good, I repeat, that it is not possible in the very nature of things, because if it was possible then there would be no necessity for religion \u2014 no need of religion.\n8. The desire to belong arises because you feel empty. In a crowd of any kind \u2014 political, religious \u2014 you forget your emptiness; the crowd fills you.\n9. With me, you have only to lose; you cannot gain anything. You are in a game where you can only be a loser. You will have to lose your ego, you will have to lose your jealousy, you will have to lose your fear. You will have to lose all kinds of crap that you are filled with. You will have to be empty \u2014 and emptiness cannot claim the ego. There is no place in emptiness, in nothingness, for the ego. You can be with me, not for anything that is going to be profitable in the future; you can be here only for this moment.\n10. Just as one peels an onion, peel your personality, layer by layer. Go on throwing those layers. New layers will be there, but finally a moment comes when the onion disappears and there is only emptiness in your hands. That moment is the moment of enlightenment. You cannot desire it, because desire adds another layer to your onion \u2014 and a far more dangerous layer than any other layer.\n11. The master is already merged into existence. Merging into the master you are really merging with existence itself. The master functions only as a door, and a door is an emptiness; you pass through it. The master is the door to the beyond.\n12. The energy of the cosmos is surrounding you. All that is needed is a certain emptiness in you. So the emptiness is good; don\u2019t fill it by beliefs, don\u2019t fill it again by another kind of god, another philosophy, some existentialism. Don\u2019t fill it. Leave it clean and fresh, and go deeper. Soon you will find from both sides, from outside and inside, a tremendous rush of energy, a tremendous rush of consciousness. Then you disappear, you are almost flooded with the cosmos. You are so small and the cosmos is so vast. You suddenly disappear into it, and that disappearance is the ultimate experience of enlightenment. Then you know you were neither an outsider, nor an insider; you are one with existence. Other than oneness with existence, nothing is going to help you. But that oneness is so easy, so obvious. Just a little relaxation, just a little turning in \u2014 not much effort, not much disciplines, not much torture for yourself.\n13. Man should be like a hollow bamboo, so that existence can pass through him. Man should be like a porous sponge\u2014 not hard\u2014 so that the doors and the windows of his being are open, and existence can pass from one end to another without any hindrance; in fact, finding anyone inside. The winds blow \u2014 they come in from one window and they go out from another window of his being. This emptiness is the highest bliss possible. But you are like a hard, unporous rock, or like a hard steel rod. Nothing passes through you. You resist everything. You don\u2019t allow. You go on fighting on all sides and in all directions as if you are in a great war with existence. There is no war going on, you are simply befooled by yourself. Nobody is there to destroy you. The whole supports you; the whole is the very earth on which you are standing, the very sky in which you breathe, you live. In fact, you are not \u2014 only the whole is.\nWhen one understands this, by and by one drops the inner hardness, there is no need for it. There is no enmity, the whole is friendly towards you. The whole cherishes you, loves you. Otherwise, why are you here? The whole brings you forth, like a tree is brought forth by the earth. The whole would like to participate in all your blessings, in all the celebrations that are possible. When you flower, the whole will flower through you; when you sing, the whole will sing through you; when you dance, the whole will dance with you. You are not separate.",
