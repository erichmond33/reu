    "text": "We recently returned from the lesser travelled path of Krabi and then onwards to the more remote, beautiful island of Koh Jum with kids \u2013 our then 2 and 5 year old. October half term meant that we visited at the tail end of the green season when showers are expected. However, in 21 days, we only had a couple of afternoons where we huddled up inside, listening the rain pour onto the ocean and bring the humidity down a notch.\nIf you are wondering whether it is worth taking little ones, including a toddler on a 14 hour flight, then transit onto another short flight to Krabi, followed by a drive and a narrowboat ride to Koh Jum \u2013 I would say a big fat YES in a heartbeat! Thailand has to be one of my all time favourite places to holiday. With wonderful food, the most beautiful scenery, sandy beaches, spectacular snorkelling & diving with all year round warmth, Koh Jum island has something to offer all the family.\nHere\u2019s my family guide to Koh Jum island, with suggestions of where to go, what to do and where to stay.\nWhere is Koh Jum Island?\nKoh Jum Island (also known as Ko Pu) is only an hour away from Krabi airport and a 30 minute longboat ride from the Krabi mainland. Koh Jum (Krabi Province) is easily accessible from Krabi and there are daily long-tail taxi boats going to and from to the main land \u2013 Krabi. It\u2019s remote in terms of being off the traditional tourist trail, but therein lies its beauty. Not a 7/11 in sight and a place where the \u2018land of smiles\u2019 comes into its own. I have visited several areas of Thailand, and it\u2019s here, on this idyllic island where I have met the most genuine and friendly locals. Mass tourism has yet to arrive and instead you will find beautiful beaches, a couple of villages, and accommodation for all budgets. Koh Jum is easily accessible from Krabi and there are daily long-tail taxi boats going to and from to the main land Krabi. Koh Lanta and Phi Phi are a short boat ride away.\nQuite a few places do close down during the green or rainy season, but a handful of places do remain open. We visited during October and November \u2013 towards the end of the green season and found plenty of places open, including local shops on Koh Jum village, a couple of beach bars/restaurants etc. We had no problem organising a private boat trip either.\nRustic or luxury? We stayed in both whilst there. Below are our thoughts on two different Koh Jum accommodation choices. There are no large hotels on Koh Jum.\nWe first stayed in the northern part of the island, close to the lush and dense green forests, but right on the beach. Our longboat navigated the few rocks into the sand where the lovely Kwan and her family welcomed us to Piman Pu on Lubo Bay.\nPiman Pu Villa is a rustic, recently constructed traditional Thai home set in a lush green tropical garden \u2013 if you are lucky you may spot a shy monitor lizard. Much of the wood was salvaged from the tsunami and lovingly turned into a peaceful retreat. The villa has a fully equipped kitchen with modern facilities, including TV, DVD\u2019s, free WiFi and a private pool just a 1 minute walk from the beach. The main bathroom comes with hot shower facilities and a separate loo and wash basin. This rustic villa has steep stairs to the upstairs bedrooms (x2 double beds) but our 2 year old managed these perfectly. As is common in Thailand, beds are harder than we are used to, but we all slept well.\nMeals can be prepared with food purchased by guests at no additional charge. Kwan, the amazing housekeeper and her family live just behind the property. Kwan will ask you what meals you will like and prepare them for you. You simply settle up the food bill directly to her at the end. Her Thai dishes are naturally wonderful and her omelettes and pancakes went down a treat. Kwan very kindly washed some laundry for us too.\nA popular request from my girls was to see her pet otter. A very friendly little chap, who loved dipping in an out of a large flower pot filled with water!\nThe villa has a local information book and Kwan is also a fountain of knowledge. We hired our long tail boat pilot for a day trip around the islands. We visited several, including Phi Phi and snorkelled in the vincinity, but we only disembarked on Monkey Island. Money island is an absolute must. the sand is literally as soft and as fine as flour but almost white in colour. Wild monkeys gamble across the beach, providing plenty of photo opportunities! The gentle slope of the beach, makes it perfect for toddlers or new swimmers too. You can hire bikes or hike too if you wish.\nThere are a couple of places to eat a few metres up the beach (Boa Hut is one) and there is also a massage place on the beach too. One of the shabby chic bars has a little swing, and a punch bag to practise your Thai boxing skills. It is a remote place, our next place was closer to the main village, but if some downtime, peace and quiet and a digital detox are what you are looking for \u2013 then this is the place. Interestingly, out of the 3 places we stayed, the Holiday Inn Resort Krabi with water slides, Piman Pu and the luxury Koh Jum Beach Villas, this was our eldest\u2019s favourite place. Sometimes a bucket and spade, a pool and a otter are all you need! For latest prices for the Piman Pu Villa \u2013 see here.\nThe pilot of our boat (ours was called Nick) prepared a tasty Thai meal for us onboard, with fresh pineapple for dessert and plenty of cold water. All the leftovers were thrown overboard to attract the fish. Such a stunning view to see, even if you don\u2019t snorkel or dive! Life jackets and snorkel equipment are provided.\nKoh Jum Beach Villas describe themselves as \u201ca luxury eco chic beach villa hideout\u201d, which perfectly describes this gem of a place. There is a huge emphasis on sustainability, and indeed much of the resort has been built using trees uprooted from the tsunami.\nKoh Jum Beach Villas are in the southern part of the island, close to the main village of Koh Jum. Guests can choose from a selection of twenty luxury beach villas either located on the beach or secluded in lush tropical gardens with stunning sunset views towards the sea, with or without a private pool and up to five bedrooms. All the villas have private gardens too. We stayed in Baan Nest, which was absolutely perfect for our family of four. A warm welcome of cool towels and refreshing fruit cocktails greeted us as we docked on the beach after a short long tail boat ride from the north.\nThe villas have air-conditioned areas, and numerous fans to cool down. Windows open in a way which can make you feel like you are outside camping but in complete luxury, with a huge comfortable, cosy bed. Natural mosquito spray is provided as well as incense coils- which is needed as the sun sets into a magnificent hue of red, pinks and oranges. The living area has tasteful furniture and fittings which ooze charm and sophistication but are totally in keeping with the natural surroundings.\nThe kitchen is fully equipped with a fridge, freezer, hob, microwave, kettle plus all utensils. A chef can even come and teach you how to cook a Thai meal in your villa.\nBathrobes and hairdryers are provided and onsite wifi too. There is one restaurant onsite, which provides delicious meals all day as well as speciality food nights on selected days of the week. A bar with light snacks provide delicious cocktails too! Just opposite is a communal pool which overlooks the beach and is the setting for evening entertainment including a fire performer! We also met there to prepare flower boats for the traditional Thai festival of Loi Krathong \u2013 it was a lovely way for guests to understand local traditions. For the latest prices for the Koh Jum Beach Villas, see here.\nYou can hire a tuk-tuk or bike from Koh Jum Beach Villas to explore the local area \u2013 Koh Jum Village is about a 15 minute tuk-tuk ride away. Further activates include kayaking through the mangroves, trekking through the flora and fauna, snorkelling, exploring the island. (Phi Phi is 30 minutes away by speed boat), diving, volleyball, golf, rock climbing, cooking class, massages, This was our final stop after nearly 3 weeks in Thailand so we opted for a massage, kayaking, hiring a tuk-tuk into the village and hanging out by the pool and beach. Some days we only saw one other family!\nWhat\u2019s your favourite Thai island?",

    "text": "Published on September 9, 2009 by Wade Shepard Follow me on Twitter here.\nWhat are the expenses for traveling the world by sea? How much does it cost for a year aboard a boat? From asking around, it is my impression that the costs are relative to your approach: if you put effort into your living and do everything you can yourself and live frugally, traveling by sea is cheap, but if you want everything done for you and want conveniences, it is expensive. This dichotomy is the same as for traveling by land \u2014 traveling can be as cheap or as expensive as you make it.\n\u201cThe laws of the sea state that you can anchor almost anywhere for free,\u201d spoke the Captain as I sat in his house on a hill in central Maine. He had built his house himself, and it sat comfortably underfinished as we sat in the dinning area in front of a fire place that I am sure set many moods during the long, dark winter months.\nI have been receiving a lot of contrary information about the cost of long term international cruising on a sailboat. Some say that it is cheap, other say that it is expensive. The Captain tells me that it is possible to sail full time around the world living on your boat for $8,000 a year, while other people have told me that a boat is a hole in the sea to chuck your money.\nIt depends on how you approach sailing was his point.\nTraveling is as expensive as you make it.\nIf you want luxery and everything provided for you, then traveling anywhere is expensive, but if you do your own leg work, put time and effort into finding the cheapest of everything, and eating bitter, then world travel is laughably cheap.\nI can travel through Europe on $10 a day. Whereas most people drop hundred dollar bills at each turn in this region. If you put effort and time into your living strategy, traveling is cheap; if you want everything done for you, luxery, and conveinence, traveling is expensive.\nIt is my impression that this is exactly the same scenario as sailing. If I do the leg work myself, if I do my own repairs on my boat, trade work for equipment, buy food in bulk and cook for myself, and put time into finding the cheapest anchorages and avoiding marinas and docks, traveling by sea can be very cheap. But if I want a boat that impresses the sailing community, pay other people to repair it, eat at restaurants and drink in bars, and stay at marinas and at docks, traveling the world by sea will be very expensive.\nThis is a difference between spending $2,500 a year and $25,000.\nI have learned a standard operating procedure for world travel that enables me to travel cheap, but this is a standard operating procedure that requires me to work at living every single day. By working at living I mean doing things for myself. If I am willing to put time and effort into my living \u2014 if I trade work or websites for accommodation, camp, make my own food, ride a bicycle \u2014 then I am able to travel with very little money.\nPaying money is for people who do not want to bother with their own living. Paying money is for people who want to sit back and have life done for them. Cruising the world has been confussed as being an act of the luxurious.\nIt is my impression that, like traveling, crusing the world by sea is an act reserved for both for the extreme rich and the extreme poor. Traveling the world by sea is both for people who want life done for them as well as those who want to handle, take care of, and control every nuance of their existence.\nTraveling by sea will either make me more dependent on other people or more dependent on myself.\nThe more I rely on myself, the cheaper I am able to live.\nIt has become my impression that the bright side to living is that its enjoyment is proportional to the work you put into it.\nThe more you polish your life, the more it will shine.\nI look forward to traveling cheaply by sea precisely because of the challenges \u2014 precisely because I will need to put my attention into living. I will need to learn, to discover, and work. I am excited at the prospect of ever chiseling my mind sharp simply from living poor.\nI fear that I would be a very bored man if I had a million dollars.\nAnd when we\u2019re tired of that, my friend, oh, you will come with me; And we will seek the sunlit roads that lie beside the sea.\nFrom sailing around in the Caribbean, my hesitation might come from two things: Bay fees (the cost of anchoring in the bay or tying up to the dock), and the usage of fresh water. Unless you\u2019ve got a fresh water maker on board, you\u2019re going to be living of life of paying to constantly refill your water reservoirs, water rationing, and far too many salt-water showers. How will water rationing combine with an infant and your wife (think washing dishes and washing Petra)? Well, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of yachties out there who\u2019ve taken their young families on trips that could help answer those questions. I\u2019d certainly be hitting up those message forums.\nOh, for what it\u2019s worth, I remember the boat paying something like US$10-15 to anchor in the bay, maybe $25 to tie to the dock. Of course, using the shower and bathrooms at some places costs extra, as does the fuel for your dingy.\nThis is exactly the type of information that I am looking for \u2014 real anecdotes from people who have sailed.\nI will definitely keep these points in mind, especially the one about the potable water, as we move further into this sailing venture.\nI am going to try to get on a sailboat and travel some long distances before buying a boat myself. I am just trying to get a feel for sailing right now, and taking it step by step.\nHave you ever considered working as crew on a boat? Fort Lauderdale florida is a good place to line up work. Lots of captains putting together crew for voyages down to the panama canal as well as transatlantic voyages to the canaries and the med. I used to hang out in southern spain and met quite a few americans who had gotten a free trip to spain by working on boats out of lauderdale. Different types of jobs from a kitchen cook to scrubbing the deck. They\u2019d hang out in the marina in F.L. and approach the captains until they found something suitable. It would give you some real experience and you might even make a buck or two.\nI will try to do that soon. I did a stay down near Ft. Lauderdale back in \u201999, but this was before I gave much heed to sailing. I may return soon and look for a boat to get some cruising experience on.\nI have been wondering the same things about sailing. I have no experience sailing. I did serve 6 years in the Canadian navy. I would be concerned about bad weather. We got into bad weather off of Newfoundland 80 ft waves 100 mile winds. This sank an oil rig and all hands were lost. How would a small sail boat handle in this type of storm. I also would want lots of training in navigation in the middle of the ocean there are no land marks to go by and if your just off shore fog can blow in very quickly.I hope to keep reading on how you proceed on your sailing.\nThank you for your advice. Those 80 foot waves sound amazing. Could you see them from where you were on the boat or were you below deck?\nI could see the waves from the bridge. The oil rig was the Ocean Ranger it was one of the largest oil rigs in the world at the time. There is a book wrote about what happen and a list of ships that were involved. I was serving on the HMCS Nipigon. You should be able to get the story on the internet.",

    "text": "The Colombian government is preparing to lift its economic growth target for the year, a reflection of a strong recovery that could result in a 4.5% increase in gross domestic product this year.\nHernando Gomez, the head of the National Planning Department, said Thursday that the economy could expand 4.5% this year, a figure substantially higher than then current official 3% target.\nA new official estimate will likely be announced once the second-quarter economic results are published in September, Gomez said.\nThe new estimates will likely bring the government\u2019s official forecasts in line with those of the central bank, which expects the economy to expand between 3.5% and 5.5% in 2010.\nThe higher growth estimates point to a faster economic recovery than the government\u2019s initial 2.5% forecast at the beginning of the year. Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said Wednesday that Colombia could grow 5% this year.\nStrong growth in consumer demand, as well as solid figures in manufacturing and retail sales, is behind the improved economic outlook. In the first half of the year, retail sales rose 9.8% from a year earlier, while industrial output climbed 5.8%.\nColombia\u2019s faster economic growth this year, after climbing a tepid 0.8% in 2009, hasn\u2019t created inflationary pressures yet. The consumer price index decreased 0.04% in July as food prices dropped 0.5% from July 2009. Food prices account for 28% of the CPI.",

    "text": "Systems and methods for delegating access to resources hosted in a distributed computing environment are described. In one aspect, a server hosts a set of resources. The server receives a request from a user to perform an operation with respect to one of the hosted resources. Responsive to receiving the request, the server determines whether the user has already been delegated authority to perform the operation. The delegated authority is independent of whether the user is a member of an administrators group associated with any resource of the server.\nThis patent application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/281,083, titled \u201cRole-Based Authorization Management Framework\u201d, filed on Oct. 26, 2002, commonly assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby incorporated by reference.\nThe invention pertains to administration of network service provider hosted resources.\nAdministrating Web sites can be time consuming and costly, especially for entities that manage large Internet Service Provider (ISP) installations. To save time and money, many ISPs support only large company Web sites, at the expense of personal Web sites. One reason for this is because computer security has become increasingly important not only to businesses and other organizations, but also to individuals. To meet such security needs, computer and Web site security strategies must be selected and enforced for each administrative scenario. Such selection and enforcement make it considerably labor and time intensive and expensive to support personal Web sites.\nFIG. 1 shows an exemplary computing environment within which systems and methods for delegating administration of a hosted resource may be implemented.\nFIG. 2 shows further exemplary aspects of system memory of FIG. 1, including application programs and program data for delegating administration of a hosted resource.\nFIG. 3 shows an exemplary procedure for delegating administration of a hosted resource.\nReliable, scalable, manageable, and secure systems and methods to delegate and implement remote administration of Web sites are described. In particular, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) computer server administrator utilizes the following described Internet Information Services (IIS) Delegation Administration (DA) framework to delegate specified Web site administration tasks to authorized users for execution. Such an authorized user may include, for example, a user that owns a personal Web site hosted by an ISP.\nUser authorization is determined in view of specified role-based access permission(s) to perform specified application operations associated with the hosted Web site. This IIS DA framework obviates existing trends involving computer security, wherein personal Web sites are not supported due to the inefficiencies of time and cost, as described above. One reason for this is because an administrator is not required to intervene (i.e., to ensure computer security and authorized access) every time a hosted personal Web site is modified or tested. Such modifications may include, for example, change of Web site content/functionality such as deployment of a new application on the Web site, etc.\nThese and other aspects of the systems and methods for delegated Web site administration are now described in further detail.\nFIG. 1 illustrates an example of a suitable computing environment 120 on which the subsequently described systems, apparatuses and methods for delegating administration of a hosted resource may be implemented. Exemplary computing environment 120 is only one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of systems and methods the described herein. Neither should computing environment 120 be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in computing environment 120.\nThe drives and associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for computer 130. Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk 148 and a removable optical disk 152, it are appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROM), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.\nA user such as an ISP Web site administrator may provide commands and information into computer 130 through input devices such as keyboard 166 and pointing device 168 (such as a \u201cmouse\u201d). Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, serial port, scanner, digital camera, etc. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit 132 through a user input interface 170 that is coupled to bus 136, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a universal serial bus (USB).\nA monitor 172 or other type of display device is also connected to bus 136 via an interface, such as a video adapter 174. The monitor can be utilized, for example, to present a user interface (UI) associated with the described systems and methods to delegate Web site administration, for example, by defining application access policies and rules as described below. In addition to monitor 172, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers, which may be connected through output peripheral interface 175.\nDepicted in FIG. 1, is a specific implementation of a WAN via the Internet. Here, computer 130 employs modem 178 to establish communications with at least one remote computer 182 via the Internet 180. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to computer 130, or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. Thus, e.g., as depicted in FIG. 1, remote application programs 189 may reside on a memory device of remote computer 182. The network connections shown and described are exemplary. Thus, other means of establishing a communications link between the computing devices may be used.\nFIG. 2 is a block diagram that shows further exemplary aspects of system memory 134 of FIG. 1, including application programs 160 and program data 164 for delegating administration of a hosted resource. In this implementation, application programs 160 include, for example Authorization Module 202, Delegation Module 204, Remote Client Web Site Administration (RCWA) module 206 (i.e., the \u201crequesting application\u201d), Execution Module 208, and Authorized Process(es) 210. For purposes of discussion, these application programs in conjunction with selected other features of the system 100 of FIG. 1, are hereinafter often referred to as the \u201cInternet Information Services (IIS) Delegated Administration (DA) Framework, or \u201cframework\u201d.\nThe Authorization Manager 202 provides security support for delegating administration of a hosted resource of IIS metabase nodes (i.e., nodes of the IIS metabase 212). The IIS metabase 212 identifies nodes for applications, resources, or objects hosted, deployed, and/or managed by the computer 130 of FIG. 1. More particularly, the metabase is a hierarchical store of configuration information and schema that are used to configure IIS. In existing systems, only users who are members of the Administrators group can view and modify a resource represented by a metabase node. In contrast to such conventional systems, the IIS DA framework, which is now being described, allows users other than those in the Administrators group (e.g., application administrators) such as Web site owners to view and/or modify particularly specified portion(s) of the IIS metabase 212. For purposes of this description, a \u201cuser\u201d is an individual that is not assigned to the Administrative group, although a user could also be of the Administrators group.\nTo this end, the Authorization Manager Module 202, via selective interaction with the Delegation Administration (DA) module 204, allows an administrative entity (i.e., a member of the Administrators group) to specify (e.g., specify via a UI displayed on the display device 172 of FIG. 1) user access permissions to nodes of the IIS metabase 212. The Authorization Manager Module 202 writes such user access permissions (i.e., policies/rules) to Authorization Policy Store 214. In one implementation, such access permissions are represented, for example, in Extended Markup Language (XML), Active Directory, Software Query Language (SQL), or some other data format.\nAn application queries the APS 214 (via API's 216 exposed by the Application Manager 202) at run time to confirm that a client is authorized to perform a requested operation on a resource. Authorization Manager provides APIs for managing authorization policy and validating access control and a user interface for administrators so that they can manage the authorization policy store.\nAn application as specified by the Authorization Policy Store (APS) 214 is a top-level node of the Authorization policy store 214. An application specifies the operations or tasks that the application can perform and declares them in the APS 214, for instance, when the application is installed. An application specification includes administrator identified application specific roles in terms of the task and operations that are needed to perform a job (e.g., in an organization). The definitions of roles, tasks and operations (methods), and scopes are stored in the APS 214. A role is an authorization or resource configuration role (e.g., an organizational permission on some set of resources). An authorization role is based on a user's job function. A resource configuration role is based on a computer's function.\nA task is a collection of low-level operations. The purpose of the task is to determine which low-level operations do some unit of work that is meaningful to administrators. An example of a task might be Change Password. Tasks can also contain other tasks. For example, a task called Manage User Accounts may include the tasks Change Password, Reset Password, Disable Account, and so on.\nAn operation is a low-level permission that a resource manager uses to identify security procedures. Several operations may be used to perform a meaningful task. (Operations are often not exposed or meaningful to administrators). An example of an operation could be WriteAttributes or ReadAttributes. A scope is collection of one or more physical or logical resources (e.g., a folder and/or files) associated with a respective authorization policy. An application can use the scope to group resources, to map a user requested resource to a scope (e.g., when an application checks for user access), and so on.\nIn this implementation, the Authorization Manager 202 allows specification of zero (0) or more groups and corresponding roles for each specified group member. A group corresponds to a user's role, and an application administrator specifies the permissions that are needed by the role by granting the group permission in an ACL for an object (e.g., application, resource, etc.). TABLE 1 shows an exemplary application definition of the APS 214, which in this implementation, is in an XML data format.\nEach application includes numerous attributes such as a substantially globally unique identifier (a \u201cGUID\u201d, e.g., d9089f17-5fa6-4ae9-bddf-8ca6cd1c06fb), a name (e.g., SiteAdminApp), and so on. Application attributes are used, for instance, to identify particular ones of the applications specified in the authorization policy store 214. In the example, of TABLE 1, the application includes a group (e.g., see tag pair \u201cAzApplicationGroup\u201d) to specify one or more users assigned to one or more \u201croles\u201d with respect to the application. A role is a set of permissions assigned to a user to enable the user to perform a set of tasks. Each application group includes a GUID attribute (e.g., value bf9d00f0-2be3-4367-a931-680038b51d0a) and a name attribute (e.g., GroupMetabaseChangeDefaultDoc). This exemplary group illustrates a single member identified by SID: S-1-5-21-3131233723-616130271-937215924-1032. For the purpose of this example, assume that this is the SID is associated with a user, \u201cUser1\u201d.\nIn this implementation, a role is applied to a set of associated objects, and then a group of users is assigned to the role.\nThe application of TABLE 1 includes an application group (although any number of such groups could be defined) with a scope. A scope is collection of one or more physical or logical resources (e.g., a folder and/or files) associated with a respective authorization policy. An application can use the scope to group resources, to map a user requested resource to a scope (e.g., when an application checks for user access), and so on. The following is an exemplary syntax to define a scope: <AzScope Guid=\u201cce010982-6b6f-4e93-804e-d04bf1ddff78\u201d Name=\u201cSite Access for \u201cUser1\u201d\u201d/>. Each scope has a unique identifier (e.g., ce010982-6b6f-4e93-804e-d04bf1ddff78) and a name (e.g., Site Access for \u201cUser1\u201d) that can be used with an Application Programming Interface (API) to access the scope. For purposes of discussion, the illustrated scope has a metabase site ID of \u201cw3svc/1\u201d.\nA role is defined when at least one (1) task has been specified with respect to an application group having access to a scope to which the role belongs. A task is one or more low-level operations to perform some unit of work for an administrator. For instance, a task might be \u201cChange Password.\u201d A task can encapsulate one or more other tasks. For example, a task called \u201cManage User Accounts\u201d may include tasks \u201cChange Password,\u201d \u201cReset Password,\u201d \u201cDisable Account,\u201d and/or so on. TABLE 3 shows an example role definition.\nThe role shown in TABLE 3 includes an AppMemberLink attribute that references an application group based on its unique identifier, in this example, bf9d00f0-2be3-4367-a931-680038b51d0a. TABLE 4 shows a scope with a related role.\nA role may define one or more tasks. A task consists of one or more low-level \u201coperations\u201d that the user is given permission to perform, together with a business rule. An operation is a low-level permission that identifies security level(s) associated with a task. Several operations may comprise a meaningful task. Examples of operations include \u201cWriteAttributes\u201d and \u201cReadAttributes\u201d. The following example of TABLE 5 illustrates a task allowing a user to change a property (e.g., the \u201cDefaultDoc\u201d property) for a Web site. The task contains two operations: one to set the value of this property, and one to get the value of this property.\nIn the example of TABLE 5, an operation is assigned a unique identifier and a name, as is the case with the definitions of the previous attributes. One of the most important characteristics of an operation is the OperationID attribute. A task can refer to one or more operations through the OperationID. TABLE 6 illustrates how to define an exemplary task.\nThe example of TABLE 6 shows two operations that are referenced by one task. This is to illustrate how a policy file can be defined. It is possible to have a task that refers to multiple operations. In one implementation, however, to ensure that the IIS Delegated Administration framework works as expected, within a policy file used with the tool, a task references only one operation. In such an implementation, when an operation is referenced by a task inside a role, the operation is not referenced by a different task inside the same role. Note, however, that the operation can be referenced by a task that is inside another role. For more information on exemplary syntax of the authorization policy store, see TABLE 11, below.\nA task is defined one or more operations (e.g., the two operations defined in TABLE 6) identified by their unique IDs, and a business rule, or BizRule. A business rule is also called an authorization script written in a scripting language such as Jscript or VBScript. In this implementation, scripts that are attached to a task object that is run when an AccessCheck API is called to verify that the user can execute a given method. In this implementation, the AccessCheck API is implemented by a known Private Object Security (POS) API of an operating system 158 (FIG. 1). The POS API looks at a user's group memberships in a token and compares them to contents of an Access Control List (ACL) to determine if the user has the requested access. Scripts may use information that is available only at run time, such as \u201ctime of day\u201d or \u201cdollar amount requested,\u201d to make an authentication decision.\nFor compliancy with the Authorization Manager 202, Delegated Administration (DA) module 204 uses one set of input values when interfacing with the Authorization Manager 202 and another set of values that are the parameters for the operation that the user wants to perform with respect to a hosted resource (e.g., a Web site) via a requesting application (e.g., the Remote Client Web Site Administration Application 208). For instance, in the preceding example of TABLE 6, for the SetDefaultDoc operation, the DA 204 utilizes as input the scope name, the operation or method name, and a value that is the value of the DefaultDoc parameter referred to in the BizRule above.\nThe DA 204 uses configuration file 218 to determine which Authorization Policy Store(s) 214 contains the input scope and to map the input operation or method name to an OperationID. In this implementation, the configuration file 218 is an XML file that specifies/defines each method assigned to a given set of users and maps the method to the corresponding operation identifier(s) (IDs) in the authorization policy store 214. The configuration file 218 also includes method parameters, scope mappings, log file data format, and command-line templates. When mapping scope name, DA 204 obtains from the configuration file 218 the path of the authorization policy store 214 where the scope is located, and the name of the application in this authorization policy store under which the scope is defined.\nAfter the DA 204 parses the configuration file for such information, the DA 204 initializes the Authorization Manager 202 using the store path, opens the desired application, and gets the client context object that will be used to call determine whether the user has access to the requested function/resource.\nIIS Delegated Administration Framework uses a registry entry of type \u201cString\u201d to store the full path to the configuration file 218 (e.g., HKLM\\Software\\Entity\\IISDelAdmin\\DelegAdminMappingPath (REG_SZ)). Such a string is stored in registry 220. TABLE 7 shows an exemplary configuration file 218.\nIn this exemplary implementation, the configuration file 218 includes the following entries: an entry for each method that will be allowed for a user; an entry for each scope, used in a store that contains a task referring to an existing method in the configuration file 218. Each scope entry corresponds to a user that has a scope in an authorization policy store. Additionally, an entry defines desired and/or default log file data format.\nIn this implementation, all of the attributes except Description are utilized. If an attribute is missing from a node definition to be used by ExecuteMethod, the method will return an error. (ExecuteMethod is an APi 222 exposed by the DA module 204 to performs an operation requested by the user\u2014if authorized).\nPublicName\u2014The method name as it will be exposed to the user, the name that the tool will validate as an entry (a parameter of the ExecuteMethod method of a Dynamic Link Library object (e.g., a COM) accessed via API 222, exposed by the DA module 204).\nExePath\u2014Defines either the path to the executable or command-line script that will be used to execute the method requested by the user or the ProgID of a COM object that is designated to perform the operation through one of its methods.\nAZStoreID\u2014Defines the OperationID that corresponds to this method in the authorization policy store.\nCmdLine\u2014Defines the way the command line for the executable module will be built, or the name of the method if ExePath specifies the ProgID of a COM object. For an executable module, in this attribute one can specify a keyword, an attribute name/value (method, parameter, and scope attributes) and a parameter index. For more information about defining CmdLine values, see the CmdLine Field Format below.\nWaitTimeout\u2014Indicates to the DA 204 how many seconds to wait after calling a CreateProcess API before exiting and logging the result. After a successful call to CreateProcess, the tool calls WaitForSingleObject (processHandle, timeout) to wait for that process to finish. This attribute is not used if the operation is associated with a COM method.\nProcessType\u2014Specifies the type of process to be used to execute the method. The valid values for this attribute are \u201cCOM\u201d (to specify that a COM method will execute the method) and \u201cCMD\u201d (to specify that a command-line executable will execute the method).\nSeparator\u2014Assists in making the output of the executable module more granular. For special characters (such as \u201c\\r\u201d and \u201c\\n\u201d), this field includes the escaped version of the character (for example, \u201c%0D\u201d and \u201c%0A\u201d). The tool always reads the value of the Separator field and then unescapes it, so one can specify these special characters to be recognized as separators by the tool. For example, suppose a result will be a string containing a set of IP addresses that are denied for a site, and also that the result is a string containing all of these addresses separated by a \u201cCRLF\u201d(\u201c\\r\\n\u201d sequence). If the Separator=\u201c%0D%0A\u201d is defined in the IISDAMethod node, instead of the OutputArray function returning the whole string with the IP addresses, the function returns an array of strings, each corresponding to an IP address from the result string.\nDescription\u2014Adds a description of the method, which can be used in the application that exposes the method to the user. For example, it is used by the sample ASP.NET application, Admin, to display the description of the method when the user moves the mouse over a method name on the page.\nIf a Parameter XML tag is defined, all of the attributes except Description are utilized. If one attribute is missing from a definition of the node and the node will be used by ExecuteMethod, the method will return an error.\nName\u2014Sent by the tool as a parameter to the AccessCheck function. The same name is be used in the BizRule of the tasks that reference the operation ID corresponding to the method where the parameter is defined.\nMetabaseProperty\u2014Can be used if the execution module will request a specific metabase property as part of its command line, for example: \u201cadsutil.exe get w3svc/1/AnonymousUserName\u201d. In this example, the parameter has the attribute MetabaseProperty=\u201cAnonymousUserName\u201d and \u201cw3svc/1\u201d is the MetabaseNode defined in the scope. For more information about defining a scope, see Scope Syntax below.\nDescription\u2014Associates a description with the parameter. For example, an application exposing the method to which such a parameter belongs to can use this field to display restrictions imposed on the parameter values.\nOne can specify the interfaces that will be used to execute a BizRule inside of a task that refers to an operation by using the Interface node. The following example shows the syntax of the Interface node: <Interface Name=\u201c\u201cFlag=\u201d \u201cProgID=\u201d\u201d/>. Interface nodes are optional, and are used when COM objects are used in the business rule of a task, which references the method. If the Interface node is defined, all of the attributes are utilized. If one attribute is missing from the node definition and the node will be used by ExecuteMethod, the method will return an error.\nName\u2014Identifies the name of the object as it is going to be used in the business rule.\nFlag\u2014Specifies the flag that will be used to create the object in the BizRule script.\nProgID\u2014Specifies the independent version ProgID of the COM object. The corresponding Name in this node is, in fact, an instance of this object. The BizRule uses the object only through the Name provided.\nEach attribute corresponds to a parameter utilized by AccessCheck related to interfaces.\n<IISDAScope PublicName=\u201c\u201cAZName=\u201d \u201cMetabaseNode=\u201d \u201cAZStorePath=\u201d \u201cAZApplicationName=\u201d \u201cGenerateAudits=\u201d \u201cAuditName=\u201d\u201d/>.\nAll of the attributes are utilized. If one is missing and the node will be used by ExecuteMethod, the method will return an error.\nPublicName\u2014the name provided to the user when the scope is created, and the name the user will provide to identify at what level in the metabase 212 the changes are made (because a user can have more than one site assigned, for example).\nAZName\u2014the name of the scope in an authorization policy store file that corresponds to this scope. The MetabaseNode defines the actual scope, which is, in fact, a metabase node where the user has access.\nAZStorePath\u2014the path of the authorization policy store where this scope are located. This attribute specifies the authorization policy store where the DA module 204 will search for this scope.\nAZApplicationName\u2014specifies the application, in the store, under which this scope is defined.\nGenerateAudits\u2014specifies whether an attempt to access this scope generates auditing.\nAuditName\u2014specifies the key string used in auditing to identify the object that was accessed (in this implementation, it confirms that this scope, in particular, was accessed).\nPath\u2014defines the path where the log file is stored. This attribute is utilized.\nThe tool returns an error if it is not present. This attribute value points to a valid and accessible folder; otherwise, the tool of this implementation does not log anything, but will generate an exception. When creating the log file for the first time, the application uses the security settings inherited from the parent folder (identified by the value of the Path attribute), which means that the identity of the COM+ application (see, other module 210) has read/write access to this folder.\nField\u2014identifies each field in the log file, using an associated Name attribute. For more information about fields, see Log File Fields below.\nThe result of the ExecuteMethod (ExecuteMethod is an APi 222 exposed by the DA module 204 to performs an operation requested by the user\u2014if authorized. The operation or task implemented by ExecuteMethod is shown as the Execution Module 208) is logged using the comma-separated values log format. In this implementation, if a logging section is not present in the configuration file 218, DA 202 does not log anything and throws an exception.\nA date and time (Date field) of the request (call to ExecuteMethod).\nA name of the user (User field; for example, if the ExecuteMethod is called inside an .aspx page, the name of the user to whom access to the .aspx page was granted will be logged).\nA method name (Method field) provided by the caller.\nA scope name (Scope field) provided by the caller.\nA value of the ExePath attribute corresponding to the method (ProcessType attribute, which is an attribute of the method definition in the configuration file attribute).\nA value of the CmdLine attribute corresponding to the method (CmdLine field).\nDelegated Administration 204 also logs in the last two positions the result (Result field) of the ExecuteMethod function 208 and the exception information (Exception field). The exception information provides details on the context of the exception (that is, in which step of the method execution the exception occurred) and the exception code that was caught by the tool.\nThe sixth field, CmdLine, utilizes a special mention. In the case of an IISDAMethod node with ProcessType=\u201cCOM,\u201d the value logged in this field is as it appears defined in the configuration file 218 in the CmdLine attribute. In the case of an IISDAMethod node with ProcessType=\u201cCMD,\u201d the value logged in this field will be either as it appears defined in the configuration file 218 in the CmdLine attribute or (in case the string refers to IISDACmdLineKeys) the value of the full command line of the executable module, if ExecuteMethod actually built the command line for the module before returning. This provides more information in the log file to help one figure out as many elements of a request as possible and to ease the troubleshooting process.\nIf there is no Field node defined, the DA module 204 logs, for example, the eight (8) fields mentioned above, and the IISDALog node is used only to get the log file path. Usually, the field name is in the form \u201cParam1,\u201d \u201cParam2,\u201d and so on, because, in addition to the above-mentioned fields that are logged by default, these are the other fields that one might find useful.\nIn this implementation, \u201cParam\u201d fields are logged after the first six fields described above. If the list of parameter values contains more elements than the actual number of Field/nodes in the IISDALog node, not all of the parameter values are logged. However, if there are fewer parameter values for a method than the number of Field nodes in the IISDALog node, the rest of the field values in the log entry will consist of a space (\u201c \u201d).\nName\u2014Used in the command-line string as a key.\nAttributeName\u2014Specifies the name of an attribute inside the configuration file, under the IISDAMethod, IISDAScope, or Parameter nodes, to which the key refers. This attribute enables one to specify either the attribute name itself or the attribute value to which it refers.\nThe command-line template allows Delegated Administration 202 to support tokens inside the command-line definition for a method (the CmdLine attribute of the IISDAMethod node). Such tokens include for example, the tokens shown in TABLE 9.\nIn this implementation, because # and $ are used for building the command line, these characters are restricted in the sense that if there is a sequence of two of these characters (like #string# or $string$), the tool will try to find an IISDACmdLineKey node that has a Name attribute equal to \u201cstring.\u201d This is an implantation dependent feature that can be modified as design architecture implies.\nThis technique of defining the command-line parameters enables one to specify environment variables, such as % SYSTEMROOT %, in the module command line. When an IISDACmdLineKey node is created, all attributes are utilized. Otherwise, ExecuteMethod will fail when trying to parse the node. For more information about defining IISDACmdLineKey nodes and how they are interpreted at run time, see CmdLine and IISDACmdLineKeys Examples.\nParameters Method\u2014sets the parameters associated with an operation. The parameters of this method is be a variant of type VT_ARRAY (where each element in the array is be of type VT_BSTR) or of type VT_BSTR. This method is called before calling ExecuteMethod.\nParamError Method\u2014checks whether the parameters were set correctly by the Parameters method. If the parameters were set successfully, it returns 0. Call this method to avoid calling ExecuteMethod if parameters were not set correctly by the Parameters method.\nScope name\u2014the scope associated with the user that is requesting the execution of the operation. The application that exposes the methods to the user collects this scope from the user. For example, using the sample ASP.NET application, the user specifies the name of the site to administer. This name is stored as a session variable and used whenever ExecuteMethod is invoked. The type of the parameter is BSTR.\nMethod name\u2014the name of the method that the user will try to execute. This name corresponds to the value of a PublicName attribute of an IISDAMethod node inside the configuration file. The type of the parameter is BSTR.\nLogResult\u2014Boolean value specifying whether the method is to log the result of the operation.\nExecuteOperation\u2014Boolean value specifying whether ExecuteMethod executes the command line or calls the COM method associated with the method. This parameter is useful when one want to use ExecuteMethod up to the point where AccessCheck decides whether the user is granted access to execute the method. If one choose not to execute any method or command line (by setting this parameter to FALSE), one can leave the values of the corresponding attributes of the IISDAMethod node as empty strings. After AccessCheck returns, the result is logged.\nFIG. 3 shows an exemplary procedure 300 for delegated administration of a Web site. In particular, the procedure illustrates exemplary processing that occurs when a user attempts to modify properties of a Web site, wherein the Web site is hosted by an ISP that implements the described IIS Delegation Administration Framework of FIGS. 1 and 2. Accordingly, and for purposes of illustration, the operations of the procedure are described with respect to the features of FIGS. 1 and 2. As noted above, in the figures, the left-most digit of a component reference number identifies the particular figure in which the component first appears.\nAt block 302, an administrative entity (e.g., a member of the Administrative group) provides one or more parameters for an operation with respect to an application and/or resources hosted by computer 130 (FIG. 1). Such provision is provided via the API 216 exposed by the Authorization Module 202 (FIG. 2).\nAt block 304, a user executes an application such as the Remote Web Site Administration (RWSA) application 206 (FIG. 2) hosted by the computer 130 (FIG. 1). The RWSA application 206 allows a user, such as a Web site owner, to modify, test, or otherwise administer content and/or functionality, or any other aspect of a Web site or resource hosted by the computer 130 (FIG. 1). As described below, authorization for such administration is dynamically determined by the Delegation Administration (DA) module 204. For purposes of this example, the user is not a member of an Administrator group with respect to administering the configuration and/or resources associated with the computer 130 of FIG. 1, although the user could be a member of such an Administrators group. At block 306, the user requests to perform at least an operation with respect to the hosted resource (e.g., Web site, etc.). To this end, the application (e.g., the RWSA application 206) invoke one or more of the APIs 222 exposed by the Delegation Administration (DA) module 204, to requests access to the operation. As already noted, user operation access to a hosted resource is controlled by several layers of functionality, as shown in TABLE 10.\nTABLE 11, an exemplary Authorization Manager Policy Store.\ncommand-line module or a COM method.\nAt block 308, the Delegated Administration module 204, determines whether the user is authorized to access the resource via the requested operation. This determination is made completely independent of whether the user is a member of an Administrators group with respect to administering the resources of computer 130 (FIG. 1). To this end, the DA module 204, via the Parameters method API 222, sets ExecuteMethod parameters. ExecuteMethod looks for an entry in registry 220 providing the path to the configuration file 218. The configuration file 218 specifies all possible methods that can be performed by all of the users and where an administrative entity can add an entry (that is, an IISDAScope node) for each user.\nAt this point, at block 306, ExecuteMethod reads the configuration file 218 and attempts to map the requested operation name, scope, and parameters to entries in that file. If these entries are found, the information related to the authorization policy store 214 (i.e., derived from the IISDAScope node attribute) is retrieved. The ExecuteMethod retrieves the information from the Authorization Policy Store 214 and verifies (e.g., a call to AccessCheck) whether the user has access to the specified scope, based on the method and provided parameters. To accomplish this, ExecuteMethod impersonates the caller to present a client's identity to resources it hosts on the client's behalf, for access checks or authentication to be performed against the client's identity. (Impersonation is the ability of a thread to execute in a security context different from that of the process owning the thread).\nAt block 310, if the user is determined to not be authorized to perform the requested operation, the user is denied access to the operation. However, at block 312, if the user is granted access to the scope and if the method referred to is in a task within the user's scope, ExecuteMethod executes a process (i.e., Authorized Process 210) or builds a Command Line 210 to execute a process that performs the user requested operation (i.e., execute via an object (e.g., a COM object) or Command Line).\nFor instance, the DA module 202 either builds the command line for the executable module that will actually execute the operation/method, or attempts to initialize a COM object associated with the operation and get the DISPID of the specified method. Then, DA module 202 calls either CreateProcess or the COM method associated with the operation, depending on what is specified in the first Boolean parameter. In the case of CreateProcess, DA module 202 uses the command line 210 just built and the process starts under the user context of an application (e.g., a COM application). For purposes of discussion, such an application is shown as Authorized Process 210.\nAt block 314, if the requested operation runs successfully, the authorized process 210 builds an output array and logs the output array to the log file 224. For purposes of discussion, such an output array is shown as a respective portion of \u201cother data\u201d 226. In this implementation, if the return type of the method is VT_BSTR or VT_ARRAY, all of the elements in the array are of type VT_BSTR.\nTABLE 11 shows an exemplary format of the Authorization Policy Store 214. For more information about the syntax of this type of file, see Authorization Policy Store File Format.\nThe following examples show how a command line is built for a module, based on the settings in a configuration file 218 and the parameters passed to the ExecuteMethod and Parameters methods.\nThe following example shows exemplary syntax of a configuration file 218 from which the exemplary command line of TABLE 11 is derived.\nIn view of the above, the following actions take place to produce this command line: \u201cSET\u201d is used as it is because it is not delimited by # or $ characters; #mn# is replaced by \u201cw3svc/1\u201d; \u201c/\u201d is used as it is because it is not delimited by # or $ characters\u201d #mp@1# is replaced by \u201cAccessFlags\u201d; and, #1# is replaced with the value of the parameter of index 1, which is 3.\nThe following example shows exemplary syntax of a configuration file 218 from which the exemplary command line of TABLE 12 is derived.\nIn summary, the following actions take place to produce this command line: \u201cSET\u201d is used as it is because it is not delimited by # or $ characters; $mn$ is replaced by \u201cMetabaseNode\u201d; #mp@1# is replaced by \u201cAccessFlags\u201d; and, #1# is replaced with the value of the parameter of index 1, which is 3.\nThe following example shows configuration file syntax from which the command line of TABLE 12 is derived.\nThe following parameters are passed to ExecuteMethod: (\u201cScope1\u201d, \u201cSetFlags\u201d). The following parameters are passed to Parameters: An array containing the following strings: \u201c1\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c1\u201d. Refer to the configuration file syntax to understand the following discussion of how this command line is built. The value of the CmdLine attribute of the method is \u201cSET #1# #2# #3#.\u201d The tool looks at the first sequence delimited by two # or $ characters, in this example #1#. Because there is a number between the two # characters, the tool replaces this token with the value of the first parameter. The tool performs the same procedure for the next two tokens: #2# and #3#.\nThe following example shows a command line that causes an error by providing an incorrect number of parameter to the Parameters method. Configuration file syntax from which the command line of TABLE 14 is derived follows.\nThe following parameters are passed to ExecuteMethod: (\u201cScope1\u201d, \u201cSetFlags\u201d). The following parameters are passed to Parameters: An array containing the following strings: \u201c1\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c1\u201d.\nIn this example, the Delegation Administration module 202 returns an error because the command line refers to a parameter with index 4 (by specifying #4# in the CmdLine attribute), but Parameters receives only three parameters. Accordingly, no command line is built.\nIn the example of TABLE 15, this method corresponds to a method with OperationID=1 in the authorization policy store 214. The path of the executable or command line 210 that performs the requested action is \u201cC:\\Adsutil.exe.\u201d The command-line template for this method is \u201cSET #mn# #1#\u201d. The time-out for this method to be executed is 10 seconds. No separator or description is defined. The method has only one parameter, named \u201cFlags,\u201d which corresponds to the \u201cAccessFlags\u201d property in the IIS metabase. The method defines the \u201cMyObject\u201d object name (corresponding to an instance of the \u201cScripting.FileSystemObject\u201d object) as being able to be used by the BizRule associated with the task that refers to the operation with ID 1 in the authorization policy store.\nIn the example of TABLE 15, the scope, defined as \u201cwww.fabrikam.com\u201d, corresponds to the scope named \u201cScope1\u201d in the store located at \u201cC:\\Store.xml.\u201d This scope inside this store is defined under the \u201cSecurityApplication\u201d application. Access to this scope generates an audit using the \u201cScope1\u201d name to identify the entry in the EventLog.\nThis template specifies that the CmdLine attribute of the \u201cSetProperty\u201d method can use (beside \u201ckeywords\u201d and #D# tokens for the parameter values) only tokens that include the \u201cmn\u201d key, which identifies by name (using $mn$) or by value (using #mn#) the attribute with the name \u201cMetabaseNode\u201d defined under the \u201cIISDAScope,\u201d corresponding to the scope specified as a parameter to ExecuteMethod.\nThe following assumptions apply to this exemplary scenario: The registry entry HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\IISDelAdmin\\DelegAdminMappingPath (REG_SZ) is defined and contains the following string: \u201cC:\\DelegAdmin\\Config\\Config.xml\u201d\u2014the configuration file 218. The Delegadm.dll object runs inside a COM+ application (i.e., the authorized process 210) whose identity has read access to this registry entry.\nThis code will attempt to allow user1 to set the AccessFlags property to 1 for the site corresponding to \u201cScopeUser1\u201d by calling the \u201cSetAccessProperty\u201d method and using the Authorization Manager APIs.\nTo accomplish this task, the following steps are performed inside ExecuteMethod: The specified parameters are validated. As noted in \u201cParameters\u201d method syntax, a parameter for the Parameters method can be either a string or an array of strings. In this example, the parameter is accepted, because it is a string. If the parameter is rejected, the corresponding error code is logged. The object attempts to get the value of the registry entry HKLM_Software_Microsoft_IISDelAdmin_DelegAdminMappingPath. In this example, the value is defined as C:\\DelegAdmin\\Config\\Config.xml. The identity of the COM+ application has access to this value. If the application cannot read the registry entry value, it logs an error.\nBecause the operation was not executed, the CMDLine field in the log file will contain the value of the CmdLine attribute of the IISDAMethod node that corresponds to the SetAccessProperty method.\nAfter the application gains access to the configuration file, it searches the configuration file for the scope \u201cScopeUser1,\u201d which is specified as a parameter. If the scope is not found, an error is logged. An error may appear even if there is an \u201cIISDAScope\u201d node that contains the PublicName attribute with value \u201cwww.fabrikam.com\u201d if this node does not have all of the utilized attributes.\nAfter the public scope name is validated, the method name is validated. The application looks for the specified method name in the configuration file 118, which is \u201cSetAccessProperty\u201d in this example. If the method is not found, the appropriate error code is logged. An error may appear even if there is an \u201cIISDAMethod\u201d node that contains the PublicName attribute with value \u201cSerAccessProperty\u201d if this node doesn't have all of the utilized attributes.\nAfter the method name is found, the corresponding IISDAMethod node is read. The tool now maps the \u201cSetAccessProperty\u201d method to the operation defined in the AZStoreID attribute, which in this example is \u201c1.\u201d As specified in syntax of the policy file, only one task in the authorization policy store can refer to this method. If more than one task in the authorization policy store refers to this method, AccessCheck may deny the access to the scope. This may occur because the business rule on one of the tasks has denied the access to the scope.\nAlong with the attributes, the subnodes of the IISDAMethod node are read to retrieve information about the parameters of the method and the interfaces that will be used in the business rule of the task that refers to this operation (in this example, the operation with ID \u201c1\u201d). If an error occurs in the validation process, a corresponding error code is logged. An error can occur because utilized attributes inside the Parameter or Interface subnodes are missing from the definition of the IISDAMethod node. The number of parameters defined in the configuration file matches the number of parameters that are set before ExecuteMethod is called (using the Parameters method). Otherwise, a specific error code is logged.\nThe application attempts to initialize the Authorization Store object using the store path, which in this example is \u201cC:\\DelegAdmin\\Stores\\User1.xml\u201d and to open the corresponding application inside this store, which in this example is \u201cSiteAdminApp.\u201d If one of the operations fails, the exception is caught and the result will be logged.\nThe application collects information about the caller (which in this example is user1) and builds the parameters for AccessCheck. The following TABLE 16 describes the AccessCheck parameters used in this example.\nof this parameter for AccessCheck.\nare interested in, which in this example is 1.\nFlags attribute in the Interface subnode, which is 9600.\ncannot be created, a specific error code is returned.\nIf the process of building the parameters for AccessCheck succeeds, the function is called and the result is checked. In this example, the user1 is granted access to the \u201cScope1\u201d scope based on the parameters and the two XML files defined. If this function fails, an exception is generated. If AccessCheck denies access to the user, a specific error code is logged.\nIn general, if an error occurs while building the command line (for example, if invalid sequences, such as defining a key as #KEY$, were used, or if undefined keys were used), the application logs an error.\nThe described systems and methods for generating a contrast-based saliency map for image attention analysis.

    "text": "Variable costing affects the reported value of inventories.\nA manufacturer has two general ways to account for fixed manufacturing costs: variable costing and absorption costing. Under variable costing, you do not include fixed manufacturing costs in your calculation of the cost of each item you produce. Under absorption costing, you allocate a portion of those fixed costs to each item. Variable costing has distinct advantages for internal planning and assessment, but you can't use it for your external financial reporting.\nVariable costing clearly separates the costs that rise in tandem with production from those that remain constant. Absorption costing, on the other hand, blurs the lines. Say your company manufactures a certain product. Producing one unit requires $5 worth of raw materials, $2 in direct labor and $1 in variable manufacturing costs, such as electricity to run the machinery. Meanwhile, you have $10,000 per quarter in fixed manufacturing costs -- such things as rent or property taxes on your production facility, equipment depreciation and salaries of supervisors. Assume you produce 5,000 units in a quarter. Under variable costing, each unit produced has a reported cost of $8 (that is, $5 plus $2 plus $1). The $10,000 in fixed costs, meanwhile, is treated as a separate quarterly expense. Under absorption costing, each unit has a reported cost of $10 -- $8, plus $2 worth of the fixed cost ($10,000 / 5,000 units = $2 per unit). If you bump production up to 8,000 units, your per-unit cost remains $8 under variable costing, but falls to $9.25 under absorption costing. The consistency offered by variable costing simplifies production budgeting. This can especially benefit a small manufacturer that can't support a separate budgeting department.\nVariable costing provides a more accurate picture of your cash flow, which is critical for small manufacturers operating with tighter margins. In the previous example, imagine you manufactured 5,000 items but sold only 4,000, at $20 apiece. Under variable costing, your revenue is $80,000, the expense you report for the cost of the goods you sold is $32,000 (4,000 x $8), and you have a $10,000 expense for fixed overhead. So your manufacturing profit is $38,000, and your balance sheet shows inventory worth $8,000 (1,000 x $8). But under absorption costing, your revenue is $80,000, your cost of goods sold is $40,000 (4,000 x $10), and you have no separate expense for fixed overhead. Your manufacturing profit is $40,000, with $10,000 (1,000 x $10) on the balance sheet as inventory. An extra $2,000 has been \"parked\" on your balance sheet rather than reported as an expense, even though you've already paid that money.\nFinancial statements prepared under variable costing provide all the data needed for break-even analysis, a key tool in determining how much your company must sell at a certain price before it shows a manufacturing profit. The basic formula is: F/(P-V)=BE, where F is the fixed costs, P is the price, V is the variable costs, and BE is the necessary sales to break even. Using the data from the example, with fixed costs of $10,000 per quarter, a $20 selling price and variable costs of $8, you get: $10,000 / ($20 - $8) = 834 units per quarter (rounded up). Because absorption-costing financial statements lump variable and fixed costs together, they can't be used for break-even analysis.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, require that you use absorption costing in financial statements prepared for outside observers, such as a potential investor in your business or a bank you approach for a loan. The GAAP standard-setters believe that absorption costing better upholds the matching principle, which requires that expenses be reported in the same period as the revenue generated by those expenses. Since fixed manufacturing costs contribute revenue only when manufactured goods are actually sold for revenue, the thinking goes, they shouldn't be expensed until then. GAAP only applies to external statements, though. You can use variable costing on internal documents. Maintaining two sets of records may add to your accounting costs, if your business doesn't handle accounting in-house, but it's not as difficult as trying to derive absorption-costing statements from those based on variable costing, or vice versa. The extra cost, if any, may be well worth the benefits to a smaller manufacturer.\nMerritt, Cam. \"The Pros & Cons of Variable Costing Accounting.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-variable-costing-accounting-43136.html.

    "text": "Maybe even with a few exclamation points and/or expletives\u2026?\nSometimes these experiences can really test our confidence in beliefs we thought we truly trusted. This may even be a good thing, an opportunity to explore a deeper meaning. We can either refine, throw out, or develop an even greater sense of confidence in these beliefs when new light and understanding are shed on concepts we held so true.\nIn Gregg Braden\u2019s 2008 book, The Spontaneous Healing of Belief, he asserts there is one belief system \u2013 and one only \u2013 that determines whether a person\u2019s beliefs are in conscious alignment with the universe \u2013 or not.\nThat\u2019s what makes it, to me, the toughest LoA question of all.\nHe also says you can discover whether you have this belief system by answering just one question.\nWhen I read what the belief system was, it made total sense. But what surprised me was Gregg\u2019s position that this one belief holds such supreme importance in our ability to co-create as a conscious partner with spirit.\nOf course: regardless of which belief you choose, you are still a powerful creator and a spiritual being. Spirit is the core of all being \u2013 no one and nothing can be left out.\n1) A world where powers of good and evil constantly oppose each other and where each power has the ability to overcome the other?\n2) A world where everything is good and all serves the good of the whole (even if it doesn\u2019t always appear that way on the surface)?\nMany of us would like to believe in #2, but there\u2019s usually that especially difficult situation \u2013 the one we are absolutely certain we\u2019ve done nothing whatsoever to attract \u2013 \u2013 that makes us question the idea of universal goodness.\nI can vouch for the truth of this, because a most definitely unwanted car accident in 2006 led me to realize I had been living with soul-wrenching compromise in the area of romantic relationships. Having been jolted on all levels, I decided to ask my soul mate, John, for what I truly wanted \u2013 which led directly to the beautiful relationship we have now.\nThe pre-accident me would have felt it way too emotionally risky to have such a direct conversation with a romantic partner, for fear of rejection.\nWhat\u2019s your answer to The Great Question?\nIf you solidly believe in an all-good universe, know that you have what some of the leading spiritual lights of our time say is the most graceful belief platform from which to manifest your dreams. The message of Abraham comes to us entirely from this perspective.\nIf you\u2019re questioning how the insane world we live in could possibly be considered all good, honor this deep questioning and be true to what you honestly believe. Many of the world\u2019s most successful people believe as you do.\nIf you\u2019re somewhere in the middle, unable to feel at home in either position, you might want to read Gregg Braden\u2019s book The Spontaneous Healing of Belief and/or Mike Dooley\u2019s books Manifesting Change or Leveraging the Universe.\nRegardless of your current answer to the Great Question, you are always in your exact right place. I would add only this: if your point of view doesn\u2019t give you an absolute feeling of inner peace, this could indicate that your answer is still evolving.\nAs Abraham teaches: when what we\u2019re thinking is in alignment with what our Inner Being knows to be true, we always feel good.",

    "text": "Week 5, Day 5 of 22 Minute Hard Corps and I kicked things off today with Resistance 2. Last night took full advantage of going to bed early, slept in this morning and caught up on some much needed sleep in general, which left my workout to be done at lunchtime at the office. I have to say I'm lucky enough to work in a building that has a small gym we can use, and with Beachbody on Demand I can stream my workouts from my phone with no problem. That kind of convenience is SO key to my busy schedule and I love that I have fewer and fewer excuses to stay on track these days!\nI would be dishonest if I said month 1 of 22 Minute Hard Corps had been easy for me. In fact, I think it took me almost 6 weeks to complete the first 4 weeks due to some personal set backs. But heading into Month 2 I made a commitment to myself that I was going to give it my all and really finish this program on a strong note.\nI think one of the greatest challenges of dealing with a tremendously busy schedule is we can so easily let our fitness goals be the first things to slip. But what I've noticed when that happens is just how much of an impact it has on other areas of my life! I generally just don't feel good when I'm not taking care of myself well.\nHey....I'm human! My goals are still important, and I'm still pushing to achieve them! With the support of my challenge groups, together we motivate and encourage each other to get going....and we deal with life's curveballs together!\nSo, with that being said, this is my game plan for this week! Since Easter was yesterday and that meant a few more carbs than usual, I'm compensating this week by cutting back on a few of my \"yellow\" containers (for those of you who don't follow Beachbody's portion control programs that means cutting back on a few carb portions!).\nWe're making full use of leftover turkey from easter to make turkey tetrazzini, and this evening I prepped a few pieces of salmon to go with the Fresh Express Chopped Sweet Kale Salad sets with lemon poppyseed dressing. I have a few bags of chili still frozen, as well as leftover frozen frittata and who doesn't love a weekday crockpot meal to make life easy!\nMeal plan and prep doesn't have to be terribly complicated. Make leftovers, make meals that freeze well, and keep things uncomplicated, particularly on weeks you are extra busy. Make use of the same breakfasts and snacks and rotate out lunches and dinners to help keep yourself on track and not having to cook 50,000 different things a week!\nInterested in joining me for an online health and fitness challenge? Complete the application below and let's talk about my next group starting in May!",

    "text": "A recent advance in gathering eggs from women will make it much easier for choosey moms to give birth to geniuses. Two British fertility clinics have found a way of safely obtaining thousands of eggs from a woman. Fertility clinics, therefore, will soon be able to give a couple thousands of embryos to pick from. So let\u2019s say that a certain couple\u2019s genes mean that normally they have only a 1% chance of conceiving a child with the genetic potential to reach a genius IQ. With the ability to select among thousands of embryos, however, this couple could now almost guarantee that their offspring has the genetic potential of a genius.\nEmbryo selection gets even more interesting when we consider how a nation such as China might use it. Imagine that in ten years China forces all its college students to get genetic tests. Students with intelligence genes in the top 1% of the top 1% of humankind are then forced to donate sperm or eggs. China then uses the sperm and eggs to create a billion embryos each year. The genetic intellectual potential of all these embryos is checked. Those in the top 10,000 are implanted into women.\nEach of these embryos has the intellectual potential to be in the top one-billionth of humankind. Now because of environmental factors many of these embryos won\u2019t turn into intellectual titans. But let\u2019s say that one in ten does. This means that each year 1,000 people with the scientific ability of Einstein will be born. By 2035 they will become adults and start doing scientific research. I imagine these Einsteins will be rather helpful to China\u2019s economy and military.\nJames D. Miller, Ph.D., J.D. was the author of this article and is Associate Professor of Economics at Smith College and writes the Game Theorist feature for TechCentralStation.com and the Random Walk Column for Better Investing Magazine.

    "text": "SHANGHAI, Jun. 10 (SMM) -- LME nickel for delivery in three months opened at USD 18,350/mt and closed at USD 19,080/mt, up USD 630/mt from a day earlier, with highest price at USD 19,349/mt and lowest price at USD 18,200/mt. Daily trading volumes were 2,450 lots and positions were 90,170 lots.\nLME base metal prices all closed with gains on June 9th, as investors' confidence is highly boosted by Reuters' report that domestic exports in May increased by 50% and from the advances of euro. It still takes time to tell whether the price decline is a real rebound or a retaliatory rebound for previous significant decline. PMI from China and the US suggested that base metals still have strong fundamentals, which will lend certain support for metal prices. However, market is still haunted by concern over the EU sovereign debt crisis and the monetary policy from China, so the possibility for prices to advance significantly is small.\nIt is expected that LME nickel prices will move between USD 17,800-19,300/mt on June 10th.",

    "text": "Colorama 443 Guitars | Fretted Americana Inc.\n1858 Hofner Colorama 443 (Selmer, London).\nThis 13-inch-wide, 1 /14 inch-deep, electric semi-solid guitar weighs just 4.10 lbs. Heavily reinforced laminated plywood top and back over framed sides with a dark red Cellulose finish with twin gold stripes around the edge of the body and on the headstock. On the top of the body (bass side) is the H\u00f6fner decal in gold with black trim. Two-piece maple neck with a beech center strip and a nut width of just over 1 11/16 inches, a scale length of 24 1/2 inches and a wonderful thick 'baseball-bat' profile. 'Slab' rosewood fretboard with a three-layer black over white plastic nut, a 'zero' and 22 original medium frets and inlaid pearl dot markers. Headstock face with matching twin gold stripes. Three-in-a-line open-back strip tuners with oval white plastic buttons. Serial number \"71\" stamped in blind on the back of the headstock. Specific shaped three-layer, black over white plastic pickguard with four screws. Single H\u00f6fner \"black-bar\" single-coil black plastic 'squared corner' pickup in the neck position with an output of 6.00k. One rotary volume control and three two-way tone-selector slider switches mounted on the pickguard. The 'Preh' potentiometer is stamped \"429\" (October 1959). Hofner 'teacup' control knob with securing grub screw. H\u00f6fner metal bar-bridge on height-adjustable metal base and H\u00f6fner basic 'trapeze' tailpiece secured to lower edge by two pins and one screw. A few small surface marks (mainly on the edges) are all that prevent this guitar from being mint. Conservatively, this exceptionally rare little guitar is in near mint (9.25) condition and is complete with the two original brown leather strap fasteners. Housed in the original (to the guitar) three-latch, shaped brown and cream softshell case with brown felt lining (9.00). Unlike most of the early H\u00f6fner guitars this one has low action and great playability - and also a unique 'rock 'n roll' sound.\nThis model was the first Colorama imported into the UK by Selmer. It originally started life in Germany as the Hofner Model 160 (single pickup) and Model 162 (twin pickup) which were produced for the European market from 1956 to 1960. The guitar features a \"semi-solid\" body, i.e it looks like a solid guitar but is really a heavily reinforced plywood box. The very earliest examples had a \"tear\" shaped pickguard, with the later models (1959-60) having a more stylized shape (like this one). A square cornered version of the standard Hofner \"black-bar\" pickup was fitted, without the usual rotary height adjustment wheels. The controls were installed in the classic Hofner consul. Metallic finishes were the norm with the first models. The guitar featured here has an original dark red cellulose finish with twin gold stripes around the edge of the body and on the headstock (a full ten years before Fender used 'racing-stripes' on their Mustang). The Selmer list price in 1959 was eighteen guineas. (The Vintage Hofner Website).",

    "text": "This is not our bodies\u2019 fault; most of us do not take care of our bodies.\nWe do not eat correctly.\nWe do not sleep correctly.\nWe do not exercise correctly.\nSome form of exercise is critical to maintaining a healthy, energetic life. When we exercise our lungs get stronger, allowing more oxygen to get into our blood. Our heart gets stronger, allowing more blood to flow to our vital organs. Our organs do not have to over work, leaving us with more energy to use throughout the day.\nOne definition of exercise is: bodily or mental exertion, esp. for the sake of training or improvement of health.\nThe definition of exertion is: vigorous action or effort.\nWith these two definitions in mind, to exercise is: to vigorously work the body.\nThis does not mean that you have to exercise for long periods of time. It is quite the opposite. The best way to maximize your cardio workout is short bursts of vigorous action, followed by short periods of restful action. One example of this would be a 30 sec sprint followed by a 30 sec walk, and repeat as many times as you can to complete your workout regimen.\nThere are endless ways to exercise, and what works for me, may or may not work for you. The #1 most important thing to remember when deciding what you want to do for exercise is: make sure you can have fun doing it. If you can enjoy the exercise you choose, then you will have better success sticking to it.\nAnything that raises your heart rate is considered cardio exercise. If you walk all day at work and then come home and walk for 30 mins, it probably is not going to raise your heart rate, therefore being ineffective. If you come home and walk extra fast or do short sprints, that will definitely be effective. Do you get the idea?\nIf you are over the age of 45, have not exercised in a long time, or suffer joint pain, you will want to adjust your exercise routine accordingly. Everyone should remember to stretch out thoroughly prior to any exercise and do not forget to cool down after exercising. Always consult a qualified health care practitioner before beginning any new exercise program.\nThis is just one of many techniques that will allow our bodies to heal itself naturally, without the use of expensive medications.\nI say, \u201cLets help our bodies help themselves\u201d.\nboost your energy naturallyenergy boost supplementenergy boosting foodshigh energy foodhow to boost energy when tiredhow to get energy in the morninghow to get energy naturallyhow to increase energy after 50how to increase energy and motivationvitamins to boost energywhat are the best foods to eat for energy?",

Combine the yeast with 3 Tbsp flour and 2 Tbsp water in the bowl of an electric mixer and set aside for 10 minutes until foamy. Add the remaining flour, 100g caster sugar, lemon zest, eggs and milk and mix with the dough hook on low speed until almost combined.\n2 Add 210g butter 1 Tbsp at a time, then beat on low speed for 5 minutes, add the salt, then mix for another 10 minutes, until a very smooth dough forms. Place in an oiled bowl and refrigerate overnight to proof slowly.\n3 Melt the remaining butter and mix in the icing sugar, cocoa and chocolate, then set aside to cool slightly.\n4 Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each to a rectangle 60cm x 30cm using just a little flour. Spread the chocolate paste over the dough, leaving a 2cm margin. Sprinkle the pecans and cinnamon sugar on top, then roll up, starting at the long edges. Slice in half lengthways, then twist each pair into a rough braid with the chocolate facing upwards. Arrange the braids in lined 1L loaf pans, cover and set aide for 3 hours, until doubled in size.\n5 Mix the remaining sugar with \u00be cup water and the cinnamon sticks and boil until syrupy, then set aside. Bake the loafs for 35-40 minutes, using a little steam at the start. When baked, brush with the syrup while still hot, then set aside to cool in the tins.",

    "text": "Discussion in 'Official News & Announcements' started by MightyZug, Aug 23, 2017.\nUPDATE (9/4): 1.4.1 is now LIVE!\nUPDATE (8/30): 1.4.0 is currently in QA with LINE. Final release date is TBD, but the most likely release dates (pending LINE then Apple approval) is either Friday (9/1) or Sunday (9/3) PST. Looking forward to releasing it ASAP!\nThe new 1.4.0 update will be going LIVE within the next couple of weeks. Notes on the changes you can expect below!\nNow, every day that you login, you get a free reward!\nUP NEXT: Painwheel, Valentine, and many more!\nEvery other week, one day will feature a 24-hour Medici Event (ex: Medici Heist) that offers the same amount of Canopy Coins as a Medici Shakedown event, but in half the time!\nThis is NOT intended to be the be-all-end-all solution to BB3 balancing, but rather a short term step in the right direction pending other adjustments. Stay tuned!\nAfter successfully blocking a BB, enemies should block for the remainder of the BB. This was most noticeable versus moves like Argus Agony, where the AI would block the laser, then charge into the \u201cbullets\u201d.\nEpic Sax\u2019s Circular Breathing SA can now trigger \"Heavy Regen\"\nPoringsmasher, MXDEX, Zuzuska and 5 others like this.\nMissions now have their own button on the Main Menu!\nNow includes bios of your favorite Skullgirls characters!\nShadowSpider, Tujae, Poringsmasher and 10 others like this.\nThis is the first major \"1.x\" update without adding a new playable character. But it looks like it will be just as great with all these improvements and fixes to make the game more fun and fair.\nHoping Ms. Fortune is up next!\nShadowSpider, Tujae, Adrian Uribe and 8 others like this.\nDaily logins and the streak preview is a nice add on to the game.\nSomething I would like to see added is an option to sell a move when you obtain it, instead of having to go into collections. And you've already mention that the next next update may have stat previews for moves when we get them.\nThanks for the update and the game.\nEdgewheel and MightyZug like this.\nWill the last hit of fracture reaper connect with big band now?\nI'm assuming the new Daily Login Rewards replace the daily relics?\nIf so that's definitely a great improvement to make daily login more worth it, though personally i still don't have much use for bronze moves and silver moves, so i'd like to see some alternatives for players with a higher player level in the future perhaps. Definitely promising.\nDaikodugo and Cellsai like this.\nWith the changes to Merry Go Rilla and Georgie's Day Out: does this mean the moves will deal less damage in 1.4.0 than they do now? Will they be getting a chance to add a debuff as compensation? Right now, every character has a special move that has no chance to apply any debuffs but does medium damage. Is every character going to get those kinds of moves changed? If not, why are Cerebella and Peacock specifically being changed?\nWhoo! I took a break from playing while waiting for a bug fix patch, but this goes above what I was hoping for! Can't wait to get back into SGM again!\nEdgewheel, BrolaireOfAsstora and moisterrific like this.\nAs far as that move archetype goes (Med damage moves that deals all its damage in one hit), Painwheel has a similar move (Pinion Dash) which is actually getting a damage boost. Eliza's Throne of Isis is getting no changes. I just am confused as to what it means for the damage tier to go from Med to Low, if that means it will actually change the damage values, and why those two are the only ones getting this particular kind of treatment. Wulf Shoot goes through block, but the notes say it will not be reclassed as a Low damage move (even if it's getting nerfed).\nThat's why I'm hoping they'll comment on my question.\nI doubt the game has some sort of built in tracker on winrate. Maybe they can pull some data from the servers about which fighters are played more often but that would still be inconclusive when deciding balance.\nA lot of players complained about the AI being too hard, then they made it easier.\nA lot of players complained about Sekhmet Mode being too underwhelming, then they made her better with longer hitstun and unblockable charge attack.\nA lot of players complained about Epic Sax being overpowered, and then he was nerfed.\nA lot of players wanted more storage space for moves and a way to see streaks in team select. And now we'll be getting that in 1.4.0.\nWith the changes to Merry Go Rilla and Georgie's Day Out: does this mean the moves will deal less damage in 1.4.0 than they do now?\nBoth moves got nerfed in the last patch and I think they're just updating the label now, this is mentioned in the notes before the character specific stuff starts. Damage was reduced because they were widely regarded as being too good. Cymbal clash was the other too-good move but it got its stun rate reduced instead of damage.\nSounds like she still has them on startup, changelog only mentions punishing its recovery.\nHuh, really? I use Boxcart George, but then I'm not sure I follow conventional wisdom on what moves to use with some characters.\nIf it's just a label update, I guess I'm ok with that. Honestly if the last patch saw those moves nerfed, I hardly even noticed. I will say, though, that it will bug me that only two characters will no longer have a move of the \"Med damage, no debuff\" archetype, but I guess for balancing it's good.\nCorrect, she still has strike invincibility during the startup of MGR.\nZuzuska, Boogiepop and Ryouhi like this.\nIt's strange they choose to buff really weak skills like Dead Cross by 5% and kinda funny they are calling it a \"game changer\", i get it.\nSo is it a new character every 2 months now?",

    "text": "Knowing God (20th Anniversary Ed.), J. I. Packer, 1993, InterVarsity Press, Downers Grove, Ill., ISBN 9780830816507, 286 pages, $20.00, softcover.\nEarlier this year, the Christian world received sad news of British-Canadian theologian J.I. Packer&apos;s retirement from public ministry due to the advance of macular degeneration that has taken his eyesight from him. He is nearly 90 years old, an elder statesman of a theological resurgence among evangelical believers across denominations. In addition to his tireless work teaching, lecturing, and writing at the collegiate and seminary levels, much of his reputation flows from a series of articles on the character of God and our relationship to Him that were gathered and published as Knowing God in 1972.\nThough this work has been driving home deep truths about our Triune Lord since well before I was born, it was to my great detriment that I only just recently picked it up for myself. Every accolade Knowing God has received through the years was just praise-I have seldom read such a clear, emphatic presentation of so much Christian doctrine. To ears ready to hear and hearts ready to obey, Packer&apos;s masterpiece is sort of a devotional \"jet fuel\" to feed the fire of spiritual maturity.\nAll of the cultural opposition to and \"slippage\" of the Christian faith that Packer spoke prophetically into in the early 1970s has only accelerated in the years since, giving his theological diagnoses to the ps ychological and social ills he imagines his readers face a very current punch. Of course, because his subject is the eternal God as revealed in His Word, the advice herein would be just as prescient had he written in the 1870s (in fact, he so often quotes Spurgeon, it almost feels like he did).\nThe content of Knowing God is a three-part layout. The first addresses the Biblical admonition to know God, marveling in the facts that 1) He wants us to know Him, 2) that we are even capable of such, and 3) that we are more known by God than we know Him.\nThe second segment does much of the philosophical heavy lifting of the book, drawing out the attributes of God to wrestle with our human frailty of belief. He leaves no stone unturned in seeking to confront readers with the God of the Bible in all His glory, immutability, majesty, wisdom, truth, love, grace, judgment, wrath, goodness, and jealousy. In effect he spends this longest section of the book in catechizing us in robust systematic theology, digging for practical application of hard truths.\nFinally, Packer focuses in on the Gospel message, dwelling on Christ&apos;s atonement and our adoption through Him as God&apos;s sons. He calls readers to lean upon their God, to know Him not as an intellectual exercise, but as the source and pillar of all their strength. He writes as someone who has seen God&apos;s face, fervently pleading with others to look to Him likewise and live.\nThis pastoral heart most characterizes Packer&apos;s work. It is a systematic theology (and a good one), but it is a systematic theology for pilgrims. Other books have more academic depth, but few achieve the devotional concern for the holiness, peace, and joy of the Christian. If one has any criticism of Packer, it is for his ecumenical efforts (none of which play in at all to this particular work), which have been seen as overbroad by many. Reading Knowing God, however, it is easy to see that any overstepping of acceptable boundaries between Christian traditions on Packer&apos;s part was not from faddishness or fame-seeking, but from his deep love for the brethren flowing out of a heart captured by the One True God.",

    "text": "Celiac disease is a serious genetic autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Therefore, people with celiac disease must eat a gluten-free diet. The disease affects 1 in 100 people worldwide, and one in 133 people in the United States. Two and one-half million Americans are undiagnosed and are at risk for long-term health complications.\nGluten, the culprit, is a family of dietary proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, oat, and other grains. It is the protein that makes dough elastic and gives bread its chewy texture. It is naturally poorly digested, and therefore more likely to engage the immune system than other proteins, even in people without celiac disease.\nIn people with celiac disease, it damages the intestinal villi, which are very small finger-like projections found along the wall of the small intestine. When the villi are injured, the small intestine can\u2019t properly absorb nutrients from food. So, again, people with celiac disease must avoid foods that contain gluten. Sometimes, they may feel isolated, as they must eat differently than others.\nAnd\u2026. we have not only a new trend in college dining halls, but also new insight in what actually causes celiac disease. A new study (Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease), published last week (April 7, 2017) in the journal Science, shows that Infection with reovirus, a common but otherwise harmless virus, can trigger the immune system to react to gluten, leading to the development of celiac disease. How? Usually, a regulatory immune response blocks inflammation to dietary antigens. However, a reovirus infection at sites where dietary gluten is present results in the induction of danger signals that confuse the immune system and lead it to develop an aggressive inflammatory immune response against gluten\u2014it is this aggressive inflammatory response that may induce celiac disease.\nFor the study, which was carried out in a mouse model, researchers used two different closely related but genetically different reovirus strains. They showed that genetic differences between viruses can change how they interact with the immune system. Both reovirus strains induced protective immunity and did not cause overt disease. However, one of the reovirus strains triggered an inflammatory immune response and the loss of oral tolerance to gluten, whereas the other strain did not.\nThe study also found that celiac disease patients produces much higher levels of antibodies against reoviruses than those without the disease. The celiac patients who had high levels of reovirus antibodies also had much higher levels of IRF1 gene expression, a transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in the loss of oral tolerance to gluten. This suggests that infection with a reovirus can leave a permanent mark on the immune system, a mark that sets the stage for a later autoimmune response to gluten.\nin the United States, babies are usually weaned from breastfeeding and given their first solid foods\u2014often containing gluten\u2014around six months of age. Children with immature immune systems are more susceptible to viral infections at this stage, and for those genetically predisposed, the combination of an intestinal reovirus infection with the first exposure to gluten could create the right conditions for developing celiac disease.\nI think this is a groundbreaking discovery as so many people are affected by celiac disease. Hopefully, this will help foster further research not only to prevent celiac disease but also to possibly cure those who already have it. After doing some research, I found that reoviruses are oncolytic and are being looked at as potential treatments for cancer. In a study done by Kim et al., it was found that an attenuated reovirus targeted cancer cells in severely immunodeficient mice without killing healthy stem cells. The attenuated reovirus also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to a wild-type reovirus . The study also implies that attenuated reoviruses could be used to treat cancer in pregnant women (1). With the recent connection of reoviruses to celiac disease, I cannot help but wonder whether this will influence their potential use for treating cancer. Could reovirus cancer treatments cause an individual to develop celiac disease? If children infected with reovirus are at a higher risk of celiac disease, are reoviruses really safe to use for cancer treatment in pregnant women?\nI find all the points you discuss fascinating \u2013 thanks for sharing. I didn\u2019t know that reovirus was being used as a treatment for cancer. Going off on your comment, I decided to investigate the specific cancers that use reovirus-based therapy. I found out that reovirus can be employed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, and is more effective if used in combination with other drugs. (1) Reolysin (the drug name that uses reovirus) works by inducing stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, which eventually leads to apoptosis. Amazingly, Reolysin can selectively attack the cancerous cells due to reovirus\u2019 ability to differentiate cells that express mutations in activated Ras signaling, specifically KRas. These mutations help facilitate viral uncoating and production of viral progeny in the cell. (2) I do share your concerns though about the potential side effects of using reovirus as a treatment \u2013 this should be thoroughly studied as the treatment looks quite promising.\nOver the past couple of years, scientists are starting the discover the importance of gut microbial and its effects on food digestion and the immune system. In the case of Celiac Disease, a virus or maybe a bacterial infection can affect the intestinal tract leading to developing celiac disease. But what about other autoimmune diseases that deal with food absorption? According to a new study (1) gut, microbial metabolites protect against type 1 diabetes. In this study, they took mice that had type 1 diabetes and fed them a diet that would increase the amounts of acetate and butyrate released by gut microbial. It turns out that if your gut microbial produce increase levels of acetate it decreases the frequency of autoreactive T cells in lymphoid tissues. Acetate effects the B cell preventing them from activating more autoreactive T cells. Increased levels of butyrate increased the number and function of regulatory T cells. It appears that dietary changes for people with T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases may be an effective natural way of treatment. Another study (2) suggested that there might be a connection between an accumulation of autoreactive T cells in the gut-associated lymphatic tissue and other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. I think we often overlook our diet and how it affects our overall health and not just our waistline. These emerging studies could also lead to new noninvasive ways of treatment.\nShannon, it is so interesting that autoreactive T cells could do so much damage and contribute do a disease that is widely accepted as a genetic disorder. This post made me want to look up what else autoreactive T cells could do in the human body and I found that they are also a large part of development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (1). The autoreactive T cells actually reduce glycolysis and cause the CD4+T cells to hyperproliferate and attain the inflammatory symptoms we see as symptoms in Rheumatoid Arthritis. This made me wonder what dietary changes could these patients make to reduce their levels of autoreactive T cells? According to a new study (2), by taking a fish oil supplement can reduce the number of autoreactive T cells all together. They also showed in this study that the fish oil also promoted an increase in CD8+ T cells in mice. More supporting evidence was found in another study (3) that showed that fasting in regular intervals also decreases autoreactive T cells that contribute to multiple sclerosis symptoms. Seeing how diet can influence all of these major diseases is eye opening and definitely needs to be explored as alternative or combination treatments for patients.\nResearchers are connecting the dots more and more everyday between autoimmune diseases and bacterial infections causing them. In a recent study, a connection was made between gut mycobacteria imbalance and the development of Chron\u2019s disease as well as ulcerative colitis (1). There is a very particular balance of bacteria that are good for us and help digest our foods for us throughout our digestive tract, but when this balance is lost, some of the bacteria can grow exponentially, causing havoc in the gastrointestinal system. The bacteria is kept in check by our bodies by controlling the pH and temperature along the GI tube, when these checks are overridden the bacteria are allowed to have a field day and grow without being controlled by the host body. One study that was found recently, focuses on what happens to your gut microbiome when you starve the body of carbohydrates as in a ketogenic diet (2). As you starve your body from carbohydrates to try and lose weight the Bacteriodes that call your gut home and whose sole purpose is to digest carbs begin to die off. This pruning of the gut microbiota allows for more invasive species to overgrow and populate areas of the GI tract that they usually are not found in. This also promotes the growth of very harmful strains of bacteria to grow that are usually kept in check by the growth of the Bacteriodes, such as Clostridium difficule (2). The research on this topic is now pointing toward the overgrowth of some bacteria getting through the gut walls and into the abdominal cavity to elicit an immune response. After a prolonged period of bacteria entering the gut, the body starts to see the intestines as foreign cells, and it immune system shifts its focus to fighting off the \u2018invader,\u2019 that is actually the body\u2019s own cells. This is what is supposedly causing the autoimmune diseases such as Chron\u2019s.\nWith research coming out on how viruses and bacteria can cause autoimmune diseases it makes you wonder how strong a role genetics play. It seems like gut flora is the missing link for a lot of diseases. In \u201cDoes the Gut Microbiota Influence Immunity and Inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis Pathophysiology?\u201d their aim was to determine if gut microflora plays a role in developing MS (1). While it is unclear how exactly gut microflora contributes to the development of MS, there is a relationship. As you mentioned earlier a stable gut flora protects against inflammation. In another study, it was noted how there are gut microbiota-host interactions that play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (2). Again, the pathophysiology is unclear but with immerging studies I imagine the relationship will soon be discovered. I think more research so go into the gut-immunity-brain axis.\nThis article was very interesting to me as it pertains to gluten and how reovirus plays a part in celiac disease. Many people suffer with gluten and have to take great measures to get by day by day. One thing I found interesting was the idea how reovirus, usually considered an inoffensive virus, can \u201ctrick\u201d the immune system to believe that gluten is harmful and causes the immune system to have a belligerent response to gluten. This is dangerous not only to adults but the article also pointed out that it can be critical to children and infants. Studies have been done to test rotavirus vaccinations in children with celiac disease as well as type 1 diabetes (1). According to Outi, their studies suggest that this vaccination can be beneficial for children who have a high chance of contracting celiac disease or type 1 diabetes. This research is just the tip of the iceberg in learning more on the relationship of rotavirus and celiac disease.\nOffering tastier gluten free foods should be a major matter in the upcoming years. Not only gluten free diet reduces the tragedy of celiac disease; but it also minimizes the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. A study that was published in April 2017 showed that schizophrenic patients who follow a gluten free diet suffer way less than those who have gluten included in their diet (1). Gluten could be associated with more diseases and some more studies on gluten effects on the human body should be done. Therefore, having tastier gluten free foods available in schools, hotels, hospitals, restaurants, ..etc. should be a major concern within the next years.\nYour comment on how gluten-free options can reduce symptoms of schizophrenia is interesting. I do not know much about schizophrenia but I know people with this disorder suffer with the symptoms associated as well as the community surrounding them. I believe having a gluten-free diet benefits these individuals in more ways than one. I found an article stating how athletes who adhere to a gluten-free diet had better success in their goals as well as their body systems (1). Little is known on this study but it\u2019s interesting how gluten-free diets can be beneficial for anyone.\nCoeliac disease is a serious ailment affecting more and more children every year. Because of the rapid increase in coeliac disease diagnosis, it is important to diagnose exactly what type of gluten-related disease a person has. Depending on the severity of the coeliac disease, doctors can determine a patient\u2019s ideal diet to decrease the negative effects of the disease and better the overall lifestyle of the patient. In a study done recently, it was reported that anti-glutaminase antibodies are specific for the diagnosis of coeliac disease and in determining specific symptoms . There are three specific gluten-related disorders: coeliac disease, wheat allergy, and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity. However, further research must be conducted to better understand noncoeliac gluten sensitivity as not much is known about this disease. It is important to conduct research on, not only coeliac disease but also, the other kinds of gluten-related ailments. These are important especially in relation to the health of young children. It is detrimental to the already fragile immune system of a child to develop coeliac disease. Like this blog post mentioned, this disease can affect all aspects of someone\u2019s life and, as an aspiring pediatrician, I would like to see more emphasis on discovering how to aid children in preventing coeliac disease.\nI had heard of celiac disease before but I was unaware that there were other gluten related disorders. After reading your post, I agree that there needs to be more research into these disorders as well. In a study by Unde et al., they attempted to identify markers for systemic immune activation in wheat sensitive individuals who did not have celiac disease. They determined that these individuals had higher levels of CD14 and LPS-binding protein in their serum. They noted that there was systemic immune activation because of antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. They also found levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 which indicated damage to the intestinal epithelium (1). I think more research like this will bring other gluten sensitive disorders to light. It may also help us determine more distinctions between celiac disease and other gluten related sensitivity disorders.\nI have always been interested in studying Celiac disease. I always wanted to learn why and how it affects so many people. I also would not mind trying to find a cure for the disease.\nI remember I had a friend during my first year of college who was very strict about avoiding foods containing any gluten at all. At first, I thought that she was avoiding foods containing gluten due to some sort of a diet fad or something of that nature. However, I later discovered that she was allergic to gluten and had suffered complications earlier in her life due to damage in her small intestine. I remember some of our mutual friends would be annoyed whenever we would want to eat certain items but she would always have us change our plans to eat something that was gluten free instead. I can thus relate to the article in that people who are allergic to gluten or have Celiac disease oftentimes feel isolated with limited options and with friends who are not interested in sharing gluten free meals with them. I think there should be a bigger push across college campuses to include more gluten free options that are enjoyable for both those who are unable to eat gluten and for their friends as well.\nI also found it fascinating that the Reovirus is involved with Celiac disease induction. Another study has also described an association between Celiac disease and chronic Hepatitis C caused by the HCV virus (1). It will be interesting to see what other pathogens contribute to Celiac disease and what preventative measures (such as vaccines) can be employed to prevent the development of Celiac disease in the first place.\nI agree with your comment; the school should have more gluten free options for some people.I didn\u2019t know much about gluten when I was growing up. I used to hear commercials talking about gluten-free products, and I thought it was just that product that had gluten. It turns out most of the stuff we eat have gluten. It must be a real pain to have that allergic reaction. However new studies have alternative ways for Celiac disease treatment without avoiding gluten products. In a study done by Marino and his colleagues shows that modification of gliadin peptides inhibits their ability to induce an immune system response. This is done by using microbial transglutaminase for the change of the gliadin peptide. This is a good alternative, but there are some side effects we know about and some we don\u2019t. Since this is relatively new, we don\u2019t know long-term side effects. Eating gluten free products is the best choice.\nI find this article to be very informative since I was not so familiar with celiac disease and how exactly it effects the human body. I have noticed a change in the food diets of our country that now normalizes gluten-free products. Just as the article mentioned, I inferred that gluten was another fad diet that was avoided by the general public to lose weight or become healthier. Though this study initially mentions it is mainly the presence of gluten itself that damages that lining of the small intestine, multiple studies have also included reovirus as being the cause for the immune confusion and eventual self-attacking episodes. The article Celiac Disease: Reovirus, Inflammatory Response, and Dietary Antigens agrees with the correlation between the reovirus and celiac disease and wanted to take studies further with a vaccine. Since there has been a vaccine made for celiac, their job was to test out the vaccine and see if there may have been an increased risk of actually developing the disease in children. However, after testing out a large amount of subjects throughout a five-year study, they did not see an increase in children with the vaccination than children without the vaccine. Though more trials may still need to be done as for the effectiveness of the vaccine against the virus, a negative correlation is currently not found.\nI, too, was not aware of celiac disease and how many people it affects. I\u2019m glad i got a chance to read about it, it opened my eye to something I\u2019ve been so unaware about for so long. It\u2019s refreshing ti know our country is making more and more gluten-free diets as this condition affects more and more people each year. It\u2019s never easy living with an autoimmune disease, and it is very informative to know more research are being done about the causes and the possible correlation this disease has with the reovirus virus. Even possibly a vaccine for the disease.\nThis post talk about how reovirus can trigger celiac disease by inducing the immune system to react to gluten. They also found out that there is higher level of reovirus antibody present in the patient with celiac disease compare with those who without the disease. Not all reovirus strains can trigger the autoimmune reaction. During their study, they found out that the ability of the strain to trigger the inflammatory immune response is depending on their genes since reovirus with different genes interact with the immune system differently. Autoimmune disease, especially inflammation of the digestive track, has been close linked to the viral or bacterial infection by many researches. Under normal condition, the intestinal mucosa is protected by the tight junction which limit the passage of the foreign antigen. Many of the research shows that certain kinds of virus or bacteria can modulate the intercellular tight junction and therefore, the intestinal mucosa permeability is increase. When the permeability is increase some foreign antigen such as gluten and other diary antigen can pass through the gut mucosal barrier and cause inflammation. The mechanism that those antigens trigger autoimmune reaction is called \u201cmolecular mimicry\u201d which microbial antigens are postulated to resemble self-antigen (1). I think that the reovirus play an important role in the \u201cmolecular mimicry \u201cmechanism of gluten. Once the autoimmune reaction is activated, it becomes independent of continue exposure to the environmental trigger and therefore self-perpetuating and irreversible (2) which means the autoimmune reaction cannot be shuttled off although the triggered antigen is being removed. Many of the inflammation bowel disease such as Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis is triggered by the incontrollable immune system. Many people may ask why gluten consumption is very susceptible in triggering autoimmune reaction? The reason for this is that gluten is made up of gliadin and glutenins which contains many toxic epitopes that can exerting cytotoxic and other gut permeating activities. Celiac disease also has close genetic association with HLA genes which is a highly specific humoral autoimmune response against tissue transglutaminase auto-antigen (2). The present of gluten in the GI track also lead to upregulation of the zonulin which is the only physiologic modulator of intercellular tight junctions described so far that is involved in trafficking of macromolecules and, therefore, in tolerance/immune response balance (2) and people with acute celiac disease have higher level of zonulin. Therefore, gluten is very susceptible in triggering the autoimmune disease and I think that future study can be conducted to investigate the relationship between the reovirus infection and the zonulin pathway.\nCeliac disease is one of many severe autoimmune diseases known to cause cancer cells. The fact that 2.5 million Americans are undiagnosed and risk complications due to long term exposure, indicates the urgency for intervention and development of vaccination. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) is a cell surface protein receptor for MHC class II antigen presenting cells. Gluten proteins, in the small intestine mucosa of patients infected with reovirus, readily binds HLA antigen DQ (HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8) with high affinity and activates T cell specific for gluten proteins that cause destruction of intestinal vili (1). Addison\u2019s disease, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and Type 1 diabetes are examples of endocrine disorders that exhibit genes for HLA autoimmune response. Therefore, gluten proteins in reovirus infected patient, will cause celiac disease and may induce other HLA-linked diseases that is detrimental to our health.\nCeliac disease is a severe genetic autoimmune disorder in which the gluten digestion leads to the small intestine being damaged. When people with is disease take in food with gluten, the body sees this as a foreign invader and sends a signal to the immune system, which attacks the small intestine. The only treatment available for people with this disease is a strict gluten-free diet. With more awareness being brought forth by this disease, it should also start the discussions about the many other autoimmune disorder relating to food or not. For example, pernicious anemia, the autoimmune condition in which the body absorption of B12 is flipped, resulting in a B12 deficiency (1). Of course, more studies can be done to get to the bottom line of why autoimmune exists in the first place. But in the case of celiac disease, it is an enormous progress that society is more aware and understanding of the importance of a gluten-free diet and making it more available.",

    "text": "AMES, Iowa - Violent crime rates are taking a nosedive across the nation, according to a data from the FBI, and Ames is one city topping the list.\nData from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report analyzed by 24/7 Wall St. shows violent crime fell to 355.5 incidents per 100,000 residents - the lowest it's been in decades. Violent crime peaked in the 1990s, but has steadily declined over the past 20 years. The data analyzed looks at a five-year span, from 2010 to 2014, and ranks Dubuque and Ames as the #1 and #2 cities in the U.S. where crime has plummeted the most.\nIn Dubuque, the five-year decrease in violent crime is 58 percent; Ames boasts a 56 percent drop in violent crime over that same five-year period. Officials with the Ames Police Department say having a low violent crime rate has helped officers focus energy on proactive measures to keep it that way.\n\"One of the tenants we have here at the police department is problem solving and relationship building,\" said Commander Jason Tuttle with Ames PD. \"And so, when we can do that, and we have the time to do that, we can get into the neighborhoods, work with some of the community leaders, work with some of the neighborhood association leaders on trying to solve specific problems in our neighborhoods. And when we do that, we're working side by side with them to work through those issues, rather than policing over them and having more of a confrontational relationship with those citizens.\"\nThere was only one homicide reported in Ames in the five-year span of the study, with zero homicides from 2012-2014. Police say the study doesn't include 2015 data, where the city had just one homicide - classified as \"justifiable\" due to self-defense.\n\"I've lived here for 30 years in the same neighborhood, and generally I would say I've never had the perception that violent crime was ever a problem,\" said Debbie Lee, leader of the Oak to Riverside Neighborhood Association in Ames.\nLee credits the police department for being proactive, by forming close relationships with the city's neighborhood associations.\n\"Progress doesn't happen in a vacuum, and I would really credit - Ames has been fortunate to have an exceptional police chief who has been willing to be creative and try different approaches,\" Lee said.\nThose different approaches include training landlords to keep crime out of their apartments, meeting with students every fall at Iowa State University, and providing resource officers to neighborhoods.\n\"I credit this very much to the leadership in the police department, that has - on the area of violent crime, on the area of mental health, on the area of alcohol abuse, on the areas of racial relations - been working very hard on being a proactive rather than a reactive situation,\" said Ames Mayor Ann Campbell.\nComm. Tuttle says it's a cycle: if you have a low violent crime rate, you can focus your energy on preventative measures to keep it that way.\n\"We don't pay a great amount of attention to these reports because we're working daily to build those relationships, and educate people in our community on how to have those safe neighborhoods,\" he said.\nWhile violent crime is down in Ames - and especially in the category of homicides - it should be noted Ames' sexual assault rate was higher in the study's span than the national average. Ames officials note, however, the rate over the five-year span of the study is lower than it was for the city in the late 2000s.",

    "text": "DIFFICULT MORAL QUESTIONS : May a woman agree to inducing delivery of her nonviable defective baby?\nQuestion 48:\u2002May a woman agree to inducing delivery of her nonviable defective baby?\nWe were surprised, since we picked this obstetrician partly because he was recommended by prolife friends. He left us alone for a while, and we talked it over. When he returned, we told him we would not have an abortion even to save my life, both because we believe abortion is wrong and because we want our baby to be born alive. We want to have her baptized and give her all the love and care we can, no matter how short her life is. The doctor said he never does abortions, but in cases like mine he does not regard inducing labor early as abortion. He also said the baby almost certainly would be born alive, so that she could be baptized, though she might live only a few minutes. And he told us that it would risk my life to go on with the pregnancy and he would not be responsible for what might happen if I do not follow his advice. We told him we needed more time to think it over.\nWe talked with our parish priest about it, and he referred us to a Sister Luke, who has studied health care ethics and works in the chaplain\u2019s office at the local Catholic hospital. After listening to our story, she told us to follow the obstetrician\u2019s advice and get the pregnancy over with. That is the right thing to do, she explained, because there is \u201ca proportionate reason.\u201d If we were sure her advice is sound, we would follow it. However, we are not sure, because my husband read that the Pope condemned something called \u201cproportionalism\u201d in his encyclical, Veritatis splendor. We want advice about what to do, and we want to make sure we do not get mixed up in something the Pope condemned.\nThe question is whether it would be morally acceptable to induce labor at once in this case. Even if a baby never will be viable, it is abortion to induce labor in order to end his or her life, and it is unjust to do anything without a grave reason that will result in shortening an unborn baby\u2019s life. So, if the pregnancy can be continued until near term without grave risk to the questioner, she should not consent to the induction of early labor. If early delivery were necessary to save the mother\u2019s life, her consenting in order to save her own life would not involve the intention to kill the baby or shorten her life. Saving the mother\u2019s life could be called a \u201cproportionate reason\u201d for accepting the baby\u2019s somewhat accelerated death. This use of the expression proportionate reason differs from that of the proportionalists whose opinion John Paul II condemned in Veritatis splendor.\nYour letter is deeply moving. So often you speak of we! It is a sign of the love with which you, less than a year married, joyfully welcomed the prospect of your first child and now, with grief but evident faith, face the prospect of losing her so soon. Telling the doctor you would not have an abortion even to save your life also showed courageous and praiseworthy readiness to accept martyrdom. Moreover, you show your Catholic sense of values: you picked an obstetrician recommended by prolife friends; you want your baby to be born alive and baptized; you sought advice from your parish priest and Sister Luke to whom he referred you; and you question the soundness of the advice, which you otherwise would follow, because you fear it might be inconsistent with papal teaching.\nYour physician has a more serious reason. Your diabetes could make continuing the pregnancy seriously harmful to you. Your question, therefore, really amounts to asking whether inducing labor now so as to forestall that harm must be regarded as abortion and excluded.\nIn my judgment, the answer partly depends on whether going on with the pregnancy would be risking your life. Without adequate knowledge of the facts and lacking medical expertise, I cannot say how much basis there is for your obstetrician\u2019s concern. However, it is possible that what he told you is unduly pessimistic, and he may also be taking too dim a view of your baby\u2019s prospects. Therefore, the first thing I think you should do is obtain a second medical opinion. That is your right, and in no way calls into question the competence of the physician you have been seeing. Though he told you he would not be responsible for what might happen if you do not follow his advice\u2014which seems to me to have put you under undue pressure\u2014he should and probably will cooperate with you in obtaining a second opinion by sending your clinical records and test results to the physician you choose to review the situation. That should be an obstetrician who practices in full accord with Catholic teaching. To identify such a person, you might try calling the offices of the obstetricians on the staff of the Catholic hospital and asking: \u201cDoes the doctor prescribe contraceptives?\u201d If the answer is yes, ask if he or she knows any obstetrician who refuses to do so. If this approach does not succeed, tell your parish priest about the difficulty and ask him to help you\u2014and, if necessary, to get an appropriate diocesan office to help you\u2014find the right doctor. Do not hesitate to press your parish priest and diocesan officials on this matter; you are prepared to lay down your life, if necessary, in order to do what is right, and you have a special claim to their help. Having identified a suitable obstetrician, tell him or her you need a second opinion, and explain the situation. After obtaining and studying your medical records and the test results, this physician probably will examine you and perhaps order additional tests. Then he or she will give you a fresh, independent evaluation and explain your options.\nI hope the second opinion will be that any problems likely to develop probably can be dealt with easily or even forestalled, without significant risk of serious and lasting harm to you. If so, your problem will be solved. Perhaps, however, there will be a serious problem, impossible to forestall and difficult to deal with, that will impose some risk of harm on you. Even so, the second obstetrician may be able to suggest a plan of care and treatment that, without gravely risking your life, will delay inducing labor until the pregnancy reaches the stage at which inducing labor for a good reason is regarded as acceptable by all Catholic moralists. In that case, accept the plan and carefully cooperate in carrying it out, even if it is unlikely to result in your baby being born alive.\nSomeone might disagree and argue that the point at which a baby normally is viable is irrelevant in your case, because your daughter is so seriously defective that even if you go to term she will die shortly after she is born. Assuming the accuracy of what your obstetrician has told you about your daughter\u2019s prospects, her life after birth will be extremely brief. However, her life remains good and she probably can live within your womb until the end of the normal period of pregnancy. Therefore, inducing labor early would deprive her of what little life she is likely to enjoy, and your responsibility is to bear and nurture her, if possible, until she is ready to be born.\nI think it quite unlikely that both obstetricians will agree that you and your baby both probably will die unless labor is induced early. But suppose that is their judgment? Even in that case, unless the danger of death is imminent, you should not agree to proceed at once, but should delay, hoping and praying for a good outcome. In that way, you will prolong your baby\u2019s life and keep open the possibility that, despite the dire predictions, things will work out so that no life-or-death choice becomes necessary. But if the time does come when you must choose between risking your life, which also would cause your baby\u2019s death, and inducing labor early, then, I think, you should choose the latter. That choice plainly will not be to end or shorten the baby\u2019s life, for, though she probably will die sooner outside your womb than within it, your reason for inducing early labor will be to prevent your own death and, if possible, to provide your baby with the benefits of living briefly outside your womb, namely, baptism and a brief period of loving care. Thus, you will not be choosing to shorten your baby\u2019s life, but only accepting that as an unwanted side effect. That will be fair to her, not only because your life also will be preserved but because she, too, will benefit.\nBecause this motive for accepting the shortening of your baby\u2019s life would be fair to her, one can call it \u201ca proportionate reason.\u201d Perhaps that is what Sister Luke meant\u2014though, it seems to me, her advice was defective insofar as she neglected to suggest that you obtain a second opinion and put off a life-or-death choice. A proportionate reason in this sense, however, differs from what is called \u201ca proportionate reason\u201d by the proportionalists whose theory John Paul II condemned in his encyclical, Veritatis splendor. Since you are anxious to avoid confusing the two, I shall try to explain the distinction.\nThe Pope\u2019s main purpose was to reaffirm \u201cthe universality and immutability of the moral commandments, particularly those which prohibit always and without exception intrinsically evil acts.\u201d167 The relevant commandment, of course, is \u201cYou shall not kill,\u201d which always and without exception prohibits killing by private individuals\u2014capital punishment and killing in just wars are a separate problem (see LCL, 469\u201381, 890\u201394, 897\u2013911). The prohibited, intrinsically evil act of killing, however, is to be understood, not merely as an outward performance resulting in someone\u2019s death, but as a freely chosen kind of behavior characterized by its \u201c\u2018object\u2019 rationally chosen by the deliberate will\u201d or, in other words, by \u201cthe proximate end of a deliberate decision which determines the act of willing on the part of the acting person.\u201d168 Now, if, in the life-and-death crisis described above, you agree to induce labor early, you will not be rationally choosing by deliberate will to kill your baby or shorten her life; your act of willing will not be a deliberate decision that she die sooner rather than later. That harm, as already explained, will only be accepted as a side effect of what you will be choosing: preventing your own death and bringing about her birth so that she will live, though briefly, outside your womb.\nIn sum, if Sister Luke meant by proportionate reason what proportionalists mean by it, she thinks you would be justified, not only in accepting the shortening of your baby\u2019s life in inducing labor at once, but even in choosing to kill her, on the theory that her death would be a lesser evil than the harm your obstetrician predicts you will suffer if your pregnancy proceeds. Since goods and bads cannot be rationally commensurated in that way, however, lesser evil here can have no definite meaning. It expresses only a subjective opinion based on feelings. On this basis, a proportionalist may regard an abortion as justified whenever the baby is expected not to live long after birth.\nYour minds may be boggled by the preceding explanation of the difference between the proportionalism the Pope condemns and the legitimate use of proportionate reason. If so, do not worry about the details, for I am sure you will grasp the fact that the two are different. Looking at the matter in your clear-eyed way, you were prepared to stake your life on one of the truths proportionalists deny\u2014that abortion is always wrong\u2014but perhaps would have followed Sister Luke\u2019s advice had your husband not read about the Pope\u2019s condemnation of proportionalism. Without articulating the point, you saw correctly that, though choosing to kill a baby always would be a terrible wrong, accepting the baby\u2019s death as a side effect could be right. Still, I hope and pray the crisis will not confront you, so that there will be no need to consent to inducing labor until your pregnancy is near term.\n166.\u2002Jean deBlois, C.S.J., Patrick Norris, O.P., and Kevin O\u2019Rourke, O.P, A Primer for Health Care Ethics: Essays for a Pluralistic Society (Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 1994), 235\u201338, note that pregnancy with an anencephalic fetus can put the mother at a somewhat increased risk and that the emotional trauma to the couple of a diagnosis of anencephaly can be considerable, assert (236) that the \u201ccondition uniformly is fatal, death usually occurring hours after birth from cardiorespiratory arrest,\u201d claim (237) that \u201cviability has no meaning as a moral marker in such cases\u201d and that once the defect occurs integrated development is impossible due to absence of the cerebral cortex, and conclude (237): \u201cOn the basis of the above analysis it seems that once the diagnosis of anencephaly has been made the pregnancy may be terminated at any time.\u201d This position is rejected\u2014I believe rightly\u2014by the Committee on Doctrine, National Conference of Catholic Bishops, \u201cMoral Principles Concerning Infants with Anencephaly,\u201d Origins, 26:17 (10 Oct. 1996): 276: \u201cHence, it is clear that before \u2018viability\u2019 it is never permitted to terminate the gestation of an anencephalic child as the means of avoiding psychological or physical risks to the mother. Nor is such termination permitted after \u2018viability\u2019 if early delivery endangers the child\u2019s life due to complications of prematurity.\u201d Peter J. McCullagh, Brain Dead, Brain Absent, Brain Donors: Human Subjects or Human Objects? (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1993), 105\u201342, and a child neurologist, D. Alan Shewmon, \u201cAnencephaly: Selected Medical Aspects,\u201d Hastings Center Report, 18:5 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 1988): 11\u201315, make it clear that the diagnosis of anencephaly sometimes is mistaken and the extent of the affliction varies; if anencephalic babies are born alive, many live more than a day and a few a month or more; some such infants behave in many ways like normal babies and may be conscious; and the cause of death varies. For infants afflicted with anencephaly who could not possibly survive long after birth, viability is irrelevant as a moral marker, but that irrelevance does not entail that aborting those infants is permissible, since the relevance of viability as a marker is that, what would have been abortion before viability may be a permissible early induction of labor after it. The fact that anencephalic infants develop a more or less perfect body (apart from their brain defect) shows that the cerebral cortex is not essential for integrated development. I conclude that choosing to terminate pregnancy when anencephaly is diagnosed is homicidal if the intended end is to reduce parental emotional trauma and is unfairly discriminatory against the baby if the intended end is to avoid the slightly increased risk of a properly managed pregnancy and natural birth.\n167.\u2002John Paul II, Veritatis splendor, 115, AAS 85 (1993) 1223, OR, 6 Oct. 1993, xviii.\n168.\u2002Ibid., 78, AAS 1196, OR, xii.\n169.\u2002Ibid., 75, AAS 1193, OR, xi.\n171.\u2002Ibid., 76, AAS 1194, OR, xii.\n172.\u2002Ibid., 77, AAS 1195, OR, xii.",

    "text": "I am just coming back from Mexico. I had the blessing a few weeks ago to lead our first pilgrimage from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nAs some of you know, I have a strong devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe. I learned it from my parents, beginning when I was a young boy growing up in Monterrey, Mexico.\nEvery summer my mom and dad would take my sisters and I on a 600-mile journey to visit our grandparents in Mexico City. And every time we went, our whole family would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nMy experience was not unique. This is what Catholic families do in Mexico \u2014 everyone tries to make a pilgrimage at least once a year to the Basilica.\nI think most of us know the Guadalupe story. It takes us back to the \u201cspiritual dawn\u201d of the Church\u2019s mission in the Americas.\nIt was December 1531 and the Blessed Virgin appeared to a poor Indian convert named Juan Diego on a hilltop outside Mexico City.\nThe Virgin entrusted Juan Diego with a mission \u2014 to go and ask the bishop to build a shrine in her name.\nTo convince the bishop, Our Lady gave him a sign. She made roses bloom even though it was the dead of winter. Then she used those roses to \u201cimprint\u201d her own image on the cloak \u2014 called a \u201ctilma\u201d \u2014 that Juan Diego was wearing.\nAnd as we know, that tilma is still hanging today \u2014 almost 500 years later \u2014 in the Basilica, which is built not far from the site where she first appeared.\nI am remembering that history today because I believe that Guadalupe holds the \u201ckey\u201d for understanding the times we are living in.\nSo, that is what I want to talk with you about today. Also, it really makes sense because the Napa Institute, as we know, is entrusted to Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nI want to offer my reflections today on the important conversation that has been going on in the Church this year \u2014 the question of how we are going to live our Catholic faith and carry out the Church\u2019s mission in a \u201cpost-Christian\u201d society. A society that every day is becoming more and more hostile to our values and our beliefs.\nI am going to offer my reflections today in three parts.\nFirst, I want to begin by looking at the cultural moment we find ourselves in. The signs of the times.\nSecond, I am going to suggest that we need to see our present situation in light of the \u201cevent\u201d of Guadalupe, I believe that in this event, we can see God\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d \u2014 his plans and purposes \u2014 for the Church in the Americas.\nThird and finally, I want to offer some reflections on some \u201cthemes\u201d that we discover in the story of Guadalupe. These themes provide us with a way forward \u2014 a way to think about our Christian lives and mission in the years ahead.\nSo with that introduction \u2014 let me begin.\nI think all of us here today feel a sense of urgency about where our country is heading.\nBack in the first centuries of the Church, St. Jerome was writing about the Arian heresy, which denied that Jesus Christ was truly God.\nBut there are too many ways our nation has never lived up to Christian values. We could point to the \u201coriginal sin\u201d of slavery, the tragic mistreatment of native populations; ongoing injustices like racism, and the million or more abortions performed each year.\nThere is no question that our institutions and national self-identity were meant to be shaped by the vision and values of the Gospel. The promise of America \u2014 what still distinguishes this country from all the rest \u2014 is our commitment to promoting human dignity and freedom under the Creator. At the heart, this is a Christian commitment.\nThe point is \u2014 all that is changing right now. We face an aggressive, organized agenda by elite groups who want to eliminate the influence of Christianity from our society.\nOur beliefs are now labeled as a kind of hatred or intolerance. Our Church institutions face lawsuits \u2014 for the \u201ccrime\u201d of still believing what Jesus taught. The \u201ccrime\u201d of not wanting to cooperate with practices we find immoral or dehumanizing.\nMy friends, we do not have the luxury to choose the times we live in. These are hard times. There is no denying it.\nBut the saints remind us that all times in the Church are dangerous times.\nThis is the challenge that Christians face in every time and every place. Are we going to shape our times? Or will we allow our times to shape us?\nWhat we decide will make all the difference. Not only for ourselves and our families. But also for our times \u2014 for our society and culture.\nAnd that brings me back to Guadalupe.\nFor me, the question is not really \u2014 how are we going to shape our times?\nThe better question is: how does God want us to shape our times? What is the path that Jesus Christ would have us follow in this moment in our nation\u2019s history?\nI want to suggest that the path already exists. It began in Guadalupe in 1531.\nThe apparition at Guadalupe was not a random occurrence. There are no coincidences in the Providence of God.\nOur Lady did not appear only for the Mexican people. Her intentions were continental and universal.\nAt Guadalupe, the Mother of God came to be the Mother of the Americas.\nGuadalupe is the true \u201cfounding event\u201d in American history. And that means it is the true founding event in the history of our country \u2014 and in the history of all the other countries in North and South America. We are all children of Guadalupe.\nGuadalupe gives us the \u201calt-history\u201d of America. In God\u2019s plan, this is one continent. It is meant to begin a new civilization. A new world of faith.\nThis is what Guadalupe is all about.\nWithin a few years after this apparition, millions came to be baptized in Mexico and throughout the Americas. A great wave of holiness swept through the continents \u2014 raising up saints and heroes of the faith in every country.\nMexico City became the spiritual headquarters \u2014 \u201cmission control\u201d for the evangelization of the Americas, Asia and Oceania.\nWhen St. Jun\u00edpero Serra came to the New World, he set sail aboard a ship called, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe. He arrived at Veracruz and he immediately started walking \u2014 300 miles to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City.\nFriends, we need to follow this example. We need to consecrate our Christian lives and the Church\u2019s mission to the Virgin.\nI think this is the answer to the challenges we face right now in our culture. The way forward for our Church \u2014 right now, in this moment \u2014 is to \u201creturn\u201d to Guadalupe.\nWe need to follow the path that the Virgin sets before us \u2014 the path of building a new civilization of love and truth in the Americas.\nSo in the remainder of our time together, I want to offer a brief reflection, a kind of spiritual interpretation of the Guadalupe story \u2014 in light of our moment here in our country.\nAs I see it, this story points to five themes \u2014 vocation, education, life, culture, and family.\nThese themes suggest certain priorities and directions for the Church.\nIf we look at them together, they give us a kind of \u201cstrategy\u201d for Christian living and for carrying out the Church\u2019s mission in this \u201cpost-Christian\u201d moment in our society.\nThe first theme is vocation. At the heart of the Guadalupe event is a story about personal vocation and mission.\nThis is a beautiful summary of the mission of the Church and the purpose of our Christian lives.\nGod is calling us to \u201cbuild a shrine\u201d with our lives. Through our work and the way we live. God is calling us to bear witness to his salvation, to the difference that Jesus Christ makes in our lives. He is calling us to show his love and compassion to our brothers and sisters.\nI think we all feel that way sometimes. That we are not worthy of what God is asking us to do. I know I can feel that way. But vocation is not about perfection. God calls every one of us and God gives each of us a mission. Your particular vocation \u2014 what God is calling you to do for him \u2014 there is no one else who can do it.\nFriends, God is speaking those words to you and to me in this time. God has a message that he wants you to deliver with your lives.\nWe need to rediscover \u2014 the beautiful truth that every one of us has a vocation \u2014 to be holy, to be saints. To build a shrine with our lives.\nHoliness does not mean separation from the world. Holiness means transforming the world \u2014 living totally for the love of God, and sanctifying the world by our love and service.\nThis is the first lesson of Guadalupe.\nThe second lesson of Guadalupe: We need to teach the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ.\nSt. Juan Diego was on his way to church when he met Our Lady. It was his custom, every Saturday and Sunday, to get up before dawn and to walk nine miles from his home to go to Mass and then go to classes to keep deepening his knowledge of the Catholic faith.\nFor Juan Diego, Jesus Christ came into his life \u2014 and there is nothing more beautiful than to know Jesus!\nThis is a message for the Church in our times.\nWe are here to share this beautiful treasure of our relationship with the living God \u2014 who became a man for us, who gave his life to save us and to make us into a new humanity. Who is living with us now and walking with us as our Friend.\nWhen we teach, we are calling people to conversion \u2014 which means a new way of thinking and looking at the world.\nOur faith is not a collection of rules and obligations. The Catholic faith is a way of living, a way of seeing the world with \u201cnew eyes.\u201d With the eyes of Jesus.\nWe need to renew in our times the Catholic imagination and our \u201csacramental\u201d vision.\nWe need to push back against the scientific and materialist vision of our age. We are living in a culture that tells us there is no reality that \u201ctranscends\u201d what we can see and hear and taste and touch.\nThis is a world without God \u2014 without the possibility of God.\nBut we know that the incarnation of Jesus changes everything! The things of nature and \u201cordinary\u201d life are transfigured. The visible world is now a \u201csacrament\u201d of invisible realities and beauty. Everything in this world can now be a sign and a pathway that brings us into the presence of God.\nAll of this is anticipated in the incarnational and sacramental vision of Guadalupe.\nIn the presence of the Virgin, Juan Diego wondered whether he was in paradise, whether heaven had come to earth. With her coming, the mountains were filled with songs like wonderful birds. Flowers bloomed in the winter season in soil where there were only stones and cactus and thorns.\nThis is the beauty that we can see with the eyes of faith. So in our teaching, we need to help people to see that our lives are connected, part of the beautiful mystery of God\u2019s plan of creation. A great adventure that is unfolding under the eyes of our loving Father.\nHoly Maria of Guadalupe appeared as an icon of new life, as a woman carrying a child.\nGuadalupe is a vision of the world as God wants it to be. The \u201cshrine\u201d that Our Lady wants us to build in the Americas is a new civilization \u2014 a culture that celebrates life and welcomes life.\nThe Christian faith in this new world confronted the brutality of the Aztec rituals of human sacrifice. From the beginning, the saints and missionaries of the Americas proclaimed that every life is precious and an image of the living God.\nAnd we need to continue this mission.\nAs we see every day in our society, life has become \u201ccheap\u201d and easily discarded. We see it in the crisis of homelessness, in the lives wasted by addiction. We see it in the push to spread euthanasia, in the continuing tragedy of abortion.\nThis is a task for us, my brothers and sisters.\nThe saints of the Americas teach us to go to the \u201cperipheries\u201d and margins of our society \u2014 to care for those who have no one to care to them. They teach us to meet \u201cothers\u201d \u2014 as brothers and as sisters \u2014 and to serve them. From the heart, at a personal sacrifice. They teach us to defend the weak and vulnerable.\nIn my reflections at Guadalupe, it struck me that there is a touching family drama in the middle of the story of Juan Diego and the Virgin.\nAs you recall from the story, Juan Diego\u2019s uncle \u2014 Juan Bernardino \u2014 is in the final days of an illness that is terminal. And as he is trying to serve the Virgin, Juan is also caring for his uncle \u2014 trying to find a priest who can come and anoint him. Also in the story, we see Our Lady\u2019s tender care to heal the sick and to console Juan Diego in his stress and grief.\nIt is a touching story \u2014 that many of us can understand from our own families. Many of us know what it means to be taking care of a loved one who is dying.\nAnd I think that speaks in a special way to our moment right now in our culture \u2014 with all the pressures to permit assisted suicide, with a population that is getting older and needing more medical care and attention.\nThis is an area where the Church can truly make a difference, in the spirit of Guadalupe. Perhaps part of the future of Catholic health care is to find ways to teach and train people in the ways of showing God\u2019s tender mercy to those who are dying and to those who cannot be cured.\nWe have beautiful examples in the lives of our American saints.\nWe need to study the witness of people like Venerable Mother Angeline Teresa McCory, the Irish immigrant to New York who was a pioneer in caring for the aged and infirm. As she did, we need to help people today to see the face of Christ in those who are sick and suffering.\nWhen we look at the self-image that Our Lady left imprinted on the tilma \u2014 we notice that she is a brown-skinned young woman \u2014 a mestizo. A person whose family background includes a mix of descendants from Europe and indigenous peoples.\nShe came dressed in the garments of the indigenous peoples and she spoke to Juan Diego in his own indigenous language.\nAnd in all this, Our Blessed Mother reveals herself in a powerful way to be an icon of the Church.\nOur Lady of Guadalupe reminds us that the Church was established to be the vanguard of a new humanity and a new civilization \u2014 one family of God drawn from every race and every nation and every language.\nRight now in our country, and even in the Church, we see signs that we still have problems with nativism and racial prejudice. So we need to pray and we need to work harder to overcome our divisions.\nThe saints of the Americas show us that holiness knows no color. Beyond the color of our skin or the countries where we come from \u2014 we are all brothers and sisters. All children of one Father. And the Mother of God is our mother.\nThis is the message of Guadalupe.\nFinally, my friends: the vision of Guadalupe encourages us to strengthen marriage and the family as the foundations of a truly human civilization.\nJuan Diego was baptized, together with his wife, Mar\u00eda Lucia, in 1524. They were among the first converts in the New World and were one of the first Catholic married couples in the Americas. Sadly she died five years later, two years before his encounter with Our Lady.\nOur Lady of Guadalupe, came among us as the Mother of the family of God in the Americas.\nSome of the earliest martyrs in this country \u2014 were missionaries who were killed for their witness to God\u2019s truth about the meaning of marriage and the family. These include the Hispanic Franciscans martyred in Georgia in 1597 and some of the martyrs of Florida.\nWe need to ask these martyrs to give us the strength we need to confront the broad cultural crisis of the family today.\nWe do this first \u2014 by living the beauty and fullness of the Church\u2019s teaching ourselves. In our own marriages and families.\nWe need to be models for a culture that is confused. We need to proclaim \u2014 by our example more than our words \u2014 the beautiful truth about the human person and God\u2019s loving plan for creation and the family.\nLet us hold up the great married saints from the Americas \u2014 like the Servants of God Eugenio Balmori Mart\u00ednez and Marina Francisca Cinta Sarrelangue. They were from Veracruz and the story of their courtship is very moving. They wrote each other beautiful poems and love letters.\nThere is beauty like this to be found everywhere in our families, in our parishes, in the joy of our children. We need to proclaim this to our culture.\nLet me try to draw some conclusions.\nWe forget this \u2014 but Guadalupe was the first place John Paul visited outside of Italy after he became Pope.\nSt. John Paul understood that the mission and meaning of America is continental, universal.\nThe nations of the Americas all trace their faith to the coming of the Virgin at Guadalupe. We share a common story of origins. And we are joined in a common destiny.\nMy simple point today is that each one of us is a part of that story \u2014 part of the great mission to America that began with the visitation of the Virgin of Guadalupe.\nThe Church in this country \u2014 and every one of us \u2014 has the responsibility to continue the task that the Virgin gave to St. Juan Diego. To \u201cbuild a shrine\u201d with our lives. To build a society that glorifies God and is worthy of the dignity of the human person.\nLet me conclude by sharing an experience I had on my recent pilgrimage.\nAfter all those years of visiting as a child, it is deeply moving for me to now be a priest and to be able to celebrate the Holy Mass at the main altar in the Basilica.\nThe altar sits directly underneath the miraculous image of the Virgin.\nAnd when you are there, you can feel the warmth of her tender eyes gazing down upon you. It is a powerful feeling, hard to describe. There is a beautiful sense of feeling protected. Of feeling like a child who is loved by the Mother of God.\nFriends, Our Mother is speaking these words to the Church today. And to each one of us.\nWe need to lay our fears and hopes at the feet of the Virgin. We need to contemplate these times we are living in under the gaze of her loving eyes.\nWe need to go always forward with confidence. Because we go with God and with his Mother.\n1.

    "text": "DETROIT: Volkswagen AG 's promise to fix pollution control systems on about 11 million diesel vehicles will involve changes to software, and possibly hardware, that could leave owners with cars that deliver diminished fuel economy and performance or require more maintenance, experts said Tuesday.\nThe German automaker's new chief executive, Matthias Mueller, said Tuesday VW customers would need to have those diesel cars \"refitted.\" The company did not specify what the refitting might entail. Some analysts have said the job could cost more than $6.5 billion.\nA former executive of Volkswagen's U.S. operation said Tuesday the company may be required to change only software, and not hardware, to bring older diesel models now deemed illegal into compliance with U.S. emissions standards.\nOther experts and U.S. regulators said the German automaker likely will have to come up with two sets of solutions for two different emission-control systems installed on 482,000 U.S. diesel cars from model years 2009-2015.\nVW has admitted using software that circumvented U.S. and California pollution rules by fully activating the exhaust scrubbing systems only when the car was being put through precisely prescribed government emissions tests.\nVW hasn't said why it used the illegal \"defeat device\" to deceive regulators. But the results, at least in the short term, were beneficial: VW was able to pass laboratory tests that showed its U.S. diesel cars met the relevant regulations, but then switched off the emission control devices while driving.\nThe benefits of switching the pollution control systems off were different depending on which system the vehicles used, experts said.\nVW initially installed the illegal software, beginning in late 2008, on 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo-diesel engines fitted with devices known as \"lean NOx traps,\" designed to reduce nitrogen oxides in engine exhaust. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog, acid rain and lung cancer.\nEPA on September 25 said it would take longer to fix older VW diesels from model years 2009-2014 that used the lean NOx traps.\nAny device used to control nitrogen oxide emissions typically \"diminishes the performance and fuel economy\" of diesel engines, according to automotive consultant Sandy Munro.\nOlder VW diesels could be made to function properly with a software fix, said Marc Trahan, who retired in late 2014 as executive vice president of group quality after a 35-year career with VW and its Audi subsidiary. They should not need to have newer hardware installed, which would take much longer, require extensive \"re-engineering\" and be cost-prohibitive, he said.\nBeginning in 2012, Volkswagen offered the same 2.0 TDI engines with a more sophisticated and expensive emissions control system called Selective Catalytic Reduction. These systems, which debuted on VW's largest car, the Passat, injected a liquid urea solution into the exhaust to break down the nitrogen oxides.\nThese systems also had software that turned them off during normal driving, the company has admitted. The consequences of running the systems all the time will be different for consumers than the older, NOx traps.\nIdeally, the urea solution used to control smog-forming gases is supposed to be replaced every 10,000 miles, typically by a dealer, but VW encountered potential problems.\nOn newer models with the SCR system, Trahan said there were concerns within the company about the urea consumption being so great that it would require separate \"fill-ups\" every 5,000 miles, rather than the desired 10,000-mile intervals that are typical between engine oil changes.",

Congressman Scott is honored to represent thousands of the nation's best shipbuilders. In Congress, Congressman Scott is a proud and active member of the bipartisan Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus. He has worked with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support shipbuilding and our nation's shipbuilders in Congress.\nCongressman Scott understands that shipbuilding and our shipbuilders are the backbone of America's Navy and vital to our national security. In Congress, one of Congressman Scott's top priorities is ensuring that the shipbuilding industry has the necessary funding and support to continue building and maintaining the most advanced ships in the world. Congressman Scott opposed the Budget Control Act, in part, because he was concerned about its impact on our national security and our ability to build and maintain America's naval fleet. If sequestration is not cancelled, shipbuilding and ship maintenance will take a significant hit, which will impact shipbuilders and their families across Virginia's 3rd Congressional District.\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 Congressman Bobby Scott (VA-03) issued the following statement after voting against the House Republicans\u2019 latest short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government: \u201cToday\u2019s vote was the fourth Continuing Resolution (CR) in as many months. CRs are an abdication of Congress\u2019 constitutional responsibility to ensure that our federal government efficiently and effectively serves the American people. CRs hamstring federal agencies and freeze their ability to award new grants and puts a hold on the Department of Defense\u2019 ability to sign new contracts for shipbuilding, ship maintenance, and other critical national security priorities. Additionally, due to operating under continued uncertainty as a result of CRs, federal agencies waste billions of dollars planning on divergent budget scenarios, including preparing for a government shutdown.\"\nWASHINGTON D.C. \u2013 Representatives Rob Wittman (R-VA), Bobby Scott (D-VA), Bradley Byrne (R-AL), and Joe Courtney (D-CT), were joined by 127 Representatives in sending a letter to Department of Defense Secretary James Mattis supporting a block buy of two Ford-class aircraft carriers in FY2019. \u201cDual procurement allows our Navy to have the capabilities it needs to protect and defend this nation\u2019s national security. A dual buy would provide predictability and sustainability to the shipbuilding industry. A more reliable procurement process will bring great benefits to the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding programs, and save taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Rep. Scott said.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Congressman Bobby Scott (VA-03) issued the following statement on President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order to expand off-shore drilling: \u201cNearly seven years to the day after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, I was disappointed to see President Trump sign an Executive Order to review the 2017-2022 Five Year Oil and Gas Leasing Program, protections put in place for sensitive offshore areas, and regulations put in place to ensure that disasters similar to Deepwater Horizon never take place.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Congressman Bobby Scott (VA-03) issued the following statement on President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Newport News Shipbuilding: \u201cI always welcome the opportunity for the President of the United States to visit my district and the world\u2019s best shipbuilders in Newport News. President Trump will see firsthand how dedicated these men and women are to their trade and to making sure that our Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers and submarines are the most advanced in the world.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Congressman Bobby Scott (VA-03) issued the following statement on his No vote on H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017: \u201cI am disappointed that House and Senate Republicans could not advance a more responsible bill to fund the federal government. Continuing Resolutions are inherently bad policy and hinder the work of the federal government. Considering the uncertainty that surrounds the incoming administration, I think it is more responsible for this Congress to enact a yearlong omnibus appropriations bill for the remainder of fiscal year 2017.\nNEWPORT NEWS, VA \u2013 Congressman Bobby Scott (VA-03) issued the following statement on the recommendations of the Center for a New American Security that the President and Congress should cancel the Ford-class aircraft carrier program and other programs at the Department of Defense: \u201cOur national security depends on a modern and technologically advanced military. While there have been issues related to the construction of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy and its primary shipbuilder for the Ford-class have already taken steps to reduce costs and address these issues for the next two aircraft carriers. Cancelling the Ford-class program would have severe consequences for national security and harm efforts to replenish and replace the fleet in the coming decades.",

    "text": "SermonIndex.net : Christian Books : CHAPTER XIV. THE ORIGINAL TEXT AND ITS HISTORY.\nCHAPTER XIV. THE ORIGINAL TEXT AND ITS HISTORY.\n1. The original language of the Old Testament is Hebrew, with the exception of certain portions of Ezra and Daniel and a single verse of Jeremiah, (Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26; Dan.2:4, from the middle of the verse to end of chap.7; Jer.10:11,) which are written in the cognate Chaldee language. The Hebrew belongs to a stock of related languages commonly called Shemitic, because spoken mainly by the descendants of Shem. Its main divisions are: (1,) the Arabic, having its original seat in the southeastern part of the Shemitic territory, and of which the AEthiopic is a branch; (2,) the Aramaean in the north and northeast, comprising the eastern Aramaean or Chaldee, and the western or Syriac; (3,) the Hebrew, occupying a middle place between the two. The Samaritan is essentially Aramaean, but with an intermixture of Hebrew forms; the Phoenician, or Punic, on the other hand, is most closely allied to the Hebrew. All these languages, with the exception of the AEthiopic, are written from right to left, and exhibit many peculiarities of orthography and grammatical forms and structure.\n2. The Hebrew characters in present use, called the Assyrian, or square writing, are not those originally employed. The earlier form is undoubtedly represented by the inscriptions on the coins struck by the Maccabees, of which the letters bear a strong resemblance to the Samaritan and Phoenician characters. The Jewish tradition is that the present square character was introduced by Ezra, and that it was of Assyrian origin. The question of the correctness of this tradition has been much discussed. Some wholly reject it, and hold that the present square writing came by a gradual process of change from a more ancient type. See Davidson's Bib. Crit., vol. I, ch.3.\nThe Rabbinic is a modification of the Assyrian or square writing, for the purpose of giving it a more cursive character.\n3. The Hebrew alphabet, like all the other Shemitic alphabets -- with the exception of the AEthiopic, which is syllabic, the vowels being indicated by certain modifications in the forms of the consonants -- was originally a skeleton alphabet, an alphabet of consonants, in which, however, certain letters, called vowel-letters, performed in a measure the office of vowels. The Shemite did not separate the vowels from the consonants, and express them, as we do, by separate signs. He rather conceived of the vowels as inhering in the consonants -- as modifications in the utterance of the consonants, which the reader could make for himself. Various particulars in respect to the pronunciation of certain consonants were, in like manner, left to the reader's own knowledge. For example, the three Hebrew letters, [Hebrew: sh], sh; [Hebrew: m], m; [Hebrew: r], r, ([Hebrew: shmr], to be read from right to left,) might be pronounced, shamar, he kept; shemor, keep thou; shomer, keeping -- the reader determining from the connection which of these forms should be used, just as we decide in English between the different pronunciations of the word bow. As long as the Hebrew remained a living language, that is, the language of the masses of the people, this outline alphabet was sufficient for all practical purposes. The modern Arabs read without difficulty their ordinary books, which omit, in like manner, the signs for the vowels. The regularity of structure which belongs to the Shemitic languages generally, makes this omission less inconvenient for them than a like omission would be for us in our western tongues.\n4. During the long Babylonish captivity the mass of the Jewish people, who were born and educated in Babylon and the adjacent regions, adopted of necessity the language of the country; that is, the Aramaean or Chaldee language. After the exile, the Hebrew was indeed spoken and written by the prophets and learned men, but not by the people at large. In Nehemiah 8:8 we are told that |they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.| This has been explained by some as meaning simply that they expounded to them the sense. But the more natural meaning is that they interpreted to the people the words read from the law. We find, soon after the captivity at least, the old Hebrew supplanted as a living language among the people at large by the Aramaean or Chaldee. Why not date the change from the latter part of the captivity itself?\nIt was natural that the prophets and historians, all of whom wrote soon after the exile, should employ the sacred language of their fathers. This fact cannot be adduced as a valid argument that the body of the people continued to speak Hebrew. The incorporation, on the other hand, of long passages in Chaldee into the books of Daniel and Ezra implies at least that this language was known to the people at large. As to the children spoken of in Neh.13:24, who |could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people| -- the people, to wit, to which their mothers belonged -- |the Jews' language| here is probably the language used by the Jews, as distinguished from that used by the people of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. Keil, Introduction to Old Testament, Sec.18.\n5. After the Hebrew had ceased to be the language of the common people, its traditional pronunciation was carefully preserved for many successive centuries in the synagogue-reading. It was not till several centuries after Christ (somewhere between the sixth and the tenth centuries) that the vowel-signs and other marks of distinction were added in order to perpetuate, with all possible accuracy, the solemn traditional pronunciation of the synagogue. This work is ascribed to learned Jews of Tiberias, called Masoretes, from Masora, tradition; and the Hebrew text thus furnished by them is called the Masoretic, in distinction from the unpointed text, which latter is, according to Jewish usage, retained in the synagogue-rolls. From reverence to the word of God, the punctuators (as these men are also called) left the primitive text in all cases undisturbed, simply superadding to it their marks of distinction. After giving with great minuteness the different vowel-signs and marks (commonly called diacritical) for the varying pronunciation of the consonants, they superadded a complicated system of accents. These serve the threefold office of guides in cantillating the sacred text (according to ancient usage in the synagogue-reading); of indicating the connection in meaning among the words and clauses; and of marking, though with certain exceptions, the tone-syllables of words. In addition to all the above, they added a mass of notes, partly of a critical and partly of a grammatical character, relating to various readings, grammatical forms and connections, modes of orthography, and the like. These are called collectively the Masorah, of which there is a fuller Masorah called the greater (found only in Rabbinical Bibles), and a briefer, called the less, the main part of which is found in common editions of the Hebrew Bible. To illustrate the Masoretic as contrasted with the unpointed text, we give the first verse of Genesis, first, in its simple unpointed form; secondly, with the vowel-signs and diacritical marks for the consonants; thirdly, with both these and the accents, the last being the complete Masoretic text.\nThe round circle above the initial letter in the third line refers to a marginal note of the Masorah indicating that it is to be written large.\nRespecting the origin and antiquity of the Hebrew points a warm controversy existed in former times. Some maintained that they were coeval with the language itself; others that they were first introduced by Ezra after the Babylonish captivity. But their later origin -- somewhere between the sixth and tenth centuries -- is now generally conceded. It is further agreed that their inventors were able scholars, thoroughly acquainted as well with the genius and structure of the language as with the traditional pronunciation of the synagogue; and that they have given a faithful representation of this pronunciation, as it existed in their day. Their judgment, therefore, though not invested with any divine authority, is very valuable. |It represents a tradition, it is true; but a tradition of the oldest and most important character.| Horne's Introduction, vol.2, p.15, edition of 1860.\n6. The deep reverence of the Jews for their sacred books manifests itself in their numerous rules for the guidance of copyists in the transcription of the rolls designed for use in the synagogue service. They extend to every minute particular -- the quality of the ink and the parchment (which latter must always be prepared by a Jew from the skin of a clean animal, and fastened by strings made from the skins of clean animals); the number, length, and breadth of the columns; the number of lines in each column, and the number of words in each line. No word must be written till the copyist has first inspected it in the example before him, and pronounced it aloud; before writing the name of God he must wash his pen; all redundance or defect of letters must be carefully avoided: prose must not be written as verse, or verse as prose; and when the copy has been completed, it must be examined for approval or rejection within thirty days. Superstitious, and even ridiculous, as these rules are, we have in them a satisfactory assurance of the fidelity with which the sacred text has been perpetuated. Though their date may be posterior to the age of the Talmudists (between 200 and 500 after Christ), the spirit of reverence for the divine word which they manifest goes far back beyond this age. We see it, free from these later superstitious observances, in the transactions recorded in the eighth chapter of Nehemiah, when Ezra opened the book of the law in the sight of all the people, |and when he opened it, all the people stood up.| The early history of the sacred text is confessedly involved in great obscurity; but in the profound reverence with which the Jews have ever regarded it since the captivity, we have satisfactory proof that it has come down to us, in all essential particulars, as Ezra left it. Of the primitive text before the days of Ezra and his associates we have but a few brief notices in the historical books. But in the fidelity and skill of Ezra, who was |a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given,| as well as in the intelligence and deep earnestness of the men associated with him, we have a reasonable ground of assurance that the sacred books which have come down to us through their hands contain, in all essential particulars, the primitive text in a pure and uncorrupt form.\n7. As to the age of Hebrew manuscripts, it is to be noticed that not many have come down to us from an earlier century than the twelfth. In this respect there is a striking difference between them and the Greek and Latin manuscripts of the New Testament, a few of which are as old as the fourth and fifth centuries, and quite a number anterior to the tenth. The oldest known Hebrew manuscript, on the contrary, is a Pentateuch roll on leather, now at Odessa, which, if the subscription stating that it was corrected in the year 580 can be relied on, belongs to the sixth century. One of De Rossi's manuscripts is supposed to belong to the eighth century, and there are a few of the ninth and tenth, and several of the eleventh. Bishop Walton supposes that after the Masoretic text was fully settled, the Jewish rulers condemned, as profane and illegitimate, all the older manuscripts not conformed to this: whence, after a few ages, the rejected copies mostly perished. The existing Hebrew manuscripts give the Masoretic text with but little variation from each other.\nEarnest effort has been made to find a reliable ante-Masoretic text, but to no purpose. The search in China has thus far been fruitless. When Dr. Buchanan in 1806 brought from India a synagogue-roll which he found among the Jews of Malabar, high expectations were raised. But it is now conceded to be a Masoretic roll, probably of European origin. Respecting the manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch, see below, No.9.\n8. In respect to form, Hebrew manuscripts fall into two great divisions, public and private. The public manuscripts consist of synagogue-rolls carefully written out on parchment, as already described, without vowel-points or divisions of verses. The Law is written on a single roll; the sections from the prophets (Haphtaroth, ch.12.6) and the Five Rolls -- Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther (ch.12.4) -- each on separate rolls. The private manuscripts are written with leaves in book form -- folio, quarto, octavo, and duodecimo; mostly on parchment, but some of the later on paper. The poetical passages are generally arranged in hemistichs; the rest is in columns which vary according to the size of the page. The text and points were always written separately; the former with a heavier, the latter with a lighter pen, and generally with different ink. The square or Assyrian character is employed as a rule, but a few are written in the rabbinic character. The Chaldee paraphrase (less frequently some other version) may be added. The margin contains more or less of the Masorah; sometimes prayers, psalms, rabbinical commentaries, etc.\n9. There is also a Samaritan Pentateuch; that is, a Hebrew Pentateuch written in the ancient Samaritan characters, and first brought to light in 1616, respecting the origin of which very different opinions are held. Some suppose that the Samaritans received it as an inheritance from the ten tribes; others that it was introduced at the time of the founding of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim; others that it was brought by the Israelitish priest sent to instruct the Samaritans in the knowledge of God, 2 Kings 17:27, 28. It is agreed among biblical scholars that its text has been subjected to many alterations which greatly impair its critical authority. These, however, are not sufficient to account for its remarkable agreement with the Septuagint version against the Masoretic text, in numerous readings, some of them of importance. The explanation of this phenomenon must be the agreement of the original Samaritan codex with the manuscripts from which the Alexandrine version was executed. Probably both were of Egyptian origin. See Alexander's Kitto, art. Samaritan Pentateuch.\nIn a brief compend, like the present work, it is not thought necessary to notice particularly the printed editions of the Hebrew Bible. The reader will find an account of them in the |Bibliographical List| appended to the fourth volume of Horne's Introduction, edition of 1860. The text of Van der Hooght's Hebrew Bible, (Amsterdam and Utrecht, 1705,) which was chiefly based on the earlier text of Athias, (Amsterdam, 1667,) is generally followed at the present day, and may be regarded as the received text of the Hebrew Scriptures.",

    "text": "No need for snow: Bangsar is freezing over, suddenly & strategically in time for Christmas, transformed into an ice cream wonderland by the milky magicians of Telawi's new Inside Scoop.\nTaking over the venue vacated by Little Wonton (which has moved to Taman Tun Dr Ismail), this ice cream shop is all about the quintessential melt-in-the-mouth delight, perhaps the most universally beloved of any dessert. Whether you're seven or 77, ice cream can seem irresistible.\nAt least half-a-dozen people _ Edmund, Shiew Li, Derrick & their friends _ appear to labor behind the counter, a clear indication that Inside Scoop is a team effort. The ice cream is produced fresh on-site, channeling skills from a co-founder's Italian gelato-making training.\nThe current flavors favor the classics & the crowd-pleasing choices: Vanilla bean to hazelnut, tiramisu to cookies-&-cream, Valrhona chocolate to pistachio, blueberry cheesecake to durian, pink grapefruit sorbet to strawberry yogurt.\nThe results straddle the line somewhere between ice cream & gelato, leaning closer to the latter.\nInside Scoop scores strongly for both texture & taste, beautifully lush in smoothness, pleasurably concentrated in purity of flavor.\nEdmund's fave: Pistachio, a true treat that distills the deep, distinct essence of this culinary nut.\nDurian flavor, cursed/blessed with a pungently telltale stench; this might be the one ice cream that KL's hotels should consider outlawing.\nPink grapefruit sorbet, also an acquired taste. Waffles with ice cream are available here too; each generous scoop of ice cream costs RM7.80, two's RM12.80 & three's RM17.50 (with a surcharge of RM1.50 per scoop for premium flavors like Valrhona choc).\nAll in all, Bangsar's hottest attraction might soon also be its coolest, harboring a potential for greater risk-taking & experimentation in the months ahead. Give Inside Scoop space to evolve; as those of us who enjoyed Cielo Dolci on its opening day would remember, even Cielo wasn't armed with a nasi lemak flavor in the beginning.\nBonus Bangsar treat: Cross the road from Inside Scoop to pop-up caffeine bar Nowhereman Coffee, which started selling glazed nuts by local entrepreneurs Nutty Nuts this past weekend.\nA fun snack, but maybe not ideal for those of us who prefer nuts to be completely savory instead of nearly candy-sweet. Still, to steal one of Nutty Nuts' catchphrases, this would work for patrons who'd rather be nutty than nice this Christmas.\n9, Jalan Telawi 3, Bangsar Baru, Kuala Lumpur. Near Nosh.\nAny idea if they have salted caramel flavour here? I am sucker for that! Oh the baby in the 2nd pic is sooooo cute!\nYour kid? Isn't there an ice cream place named Scoop? Selections all look really good!\nOh telawi 3 is certainly happening!\nBeato is on the same street too!\nCool! I like the name too - nice wordplay!\nI was trying to get to a restaurant yesterday from reading your blog - it's the best resource, good work mate!\nA very nice reference, do keep it up! Thanks for your hard work!\nIce cream...I need some as soon as I rid myself of the long winded fire engine cough.\nThe above ice cream you had in cup is 1 or 2 scoops?",

    "text": "This might be good for the likes of those who live at this rural spot - I recently quoted them for a EAD circuit to rescue them from the paltry 0.3 Mbps connection they can get on copper. The Excess Construction Costs were staggeringly high.\nWhilst providing the geographically challenged speeds of 10 Mbps sounds great; speed and the need for speed will continue to outpace their requirement. Streaming 4K Ultra High Definition, for example, requires about 25 Mbps speeds and although it is relatively new right now, it will be the norm in the coming years and 10 Mbps will not suffice.\nWe are seeing this in the EAD circuits we are delivering to customers at 2 Circles. There is already a fierce trend building on bearer circuits, where we no longer sell 10Mb bearers as they are too limiting. The amount of 100Mb bearers is in sharp decline as businesses conclude that within a mere 36 months they might require greater. 1Gb bearers are becoming the norm, where some customers have ordered and installed (subject to the usual postcode lottery) a 1Gb circuit running at the full 1 Gbps speed for less than \u00a3500 per month. 2017 has also seen our first internet facing 10Gb bearer order and we have more in quote stage right now.\nIt\u2019s difficult to see how 10 Mbps speeds in 2020 is going to make any real difference to 0.3 Mbps today for the UK Small Business. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose?\n\"Homes and businesses will have a legal right to demand faster broadband speed by 2020, the government has said, after rejecting a voluntary offer from BT.\"",

    "text": "Len Hjalmarson has some thoughts on Good to Great, which I mentioned recently. Collins identifies a certain type of successful CEO which exhibits what he calls \u201cLevel 5 Leadership.\u201d Len links to a Fast Company article from 2001 which provides a good overview of Collins\u2019 book, which includes a section on how change occurs. I find not only Collins\u2019 thinking on effective leadership to be of note, but also his outline of how change occurs. Slowly, gradually, gaining momentum\u2026 until the tipping point (not his phrase, I\u2019m mixing metaphors again). I think this perspective is instructive for the missional church, on both counts.\nI picked up Good to Great about a week ago and I\u2019m finding a lot of links about the information as it applies to personal goals, non-profit (I read the monograph on the social service sector before the book, an order I don\u2019t recommend), and the church.\nBill, I\u2019m quite struck by your comment that Level 5 leadership is out of line with Mat. 20:25-28. My own reaction was how similar they are. Level 5 leaders are personally humble and put the good of the company over their own aspirations. In the book it also talks about executives who gave their workers privileges and benefits that they themselves didn\u2019t have. A servant leadership model runs through the book, so I\u2019m not sure where you see incongruity.\nI would tend to see Level 5 Leadership as more like a business implimentation of servant leadership rather than a model for biblical leadership. It doesn\u2019t purport to be that, and though I see some parallels I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to force the comparison to run in the wrong direction. I am also troubled at the widespread use of Collins for church purposes, maingly BHAGs as you say. A \u201cspiritualized BHAG\u201d might still just be presumption and personal ambition. The contexts using Collins in the church seem to be more Willow Creed Pastor-as-CEO types, and I\u2019m uncomfortable with that whole scene. As Jude says, I do see a servant leadership them running through the book, but that might tend to be ignored in the Pastor-as-CEO type of thinking. I don\u2019t think the leadership the Collins describes is incongrouous with the New Testament, but it\u2019s only a small slice of the picture\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t try to be any more than what it is.\nRecently I\u2019ve been thinking about the flywheel and the idea of the emerging/missional church gaining momentum, which I really like.\nFor the record, I read the book as a business owner looking for its insights for business purposes\u2026 whatever I\u2019m taking from it for church leadership contexts is for me secondary and incidental. I\u2019m not sure I would recommend it for anyone looking for insight specifically and only for the church\u2026 for those who just want a good overview for that purpose, read the article I linked. For those interested in the business angle, I can\u2019t recommend it more highly than to say it\u2019s the most important book I\u2019ve read since Cluetrain.\nRob suggested that I contact you. I\u2019ve been watching the site since spring.\nHe said that we each had some common experiences re the ch and ch leadership.\nI am continuing research and would like some contact and input from others.\nMaybe you could contact me via email. Thanks.\nThe challenge of godly leadership and its requirements continue to challenge the thinking and paradigms of leadership by many. Keep at it.\nJesus himself drew upon business analogies \u2013 but didn\u2019t use business as a basis for designing the kingdom. I hear BM (that is a rather unfortunate initial set for your pseudonym, isn\u2019t it) on making sure one doesn\u2019t run the comparison the wrong way. I see it as when one follows biblical principles, even when not necessarily trying to be biblical, it tends to work. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that ethics didn\u2019t enter into the topic at all, and that Phillip Morris was included as a great company. Nonetheless, it is a fabulous book in identifying principles that will help any individual or organization get where they want to go.\nCan anyone tell the difference between Willowback\u2019s \u201cPastor-as-CEO\u201d, the New Apostlic Reformation\u2019s self-identified \u201capostles & prophets of the city and/or nation\u201d, and Collins\u2019 Level Five leaders?\nI say that because, as someone who was royally \u201cburnt\u201d (or you can insert more colourful metaphors if you prefer) by the pastor-as-CEO types, I clearly recall them all carrying and quoting Collins\u2019 Good To Great like it was the fifth Gospel.\nIn the place I came from, the pastors were seen carrying the Bible around and quoting it plus the leader\u2019s/\u201dapostle\u2019s\u201d interpretation as if it were the fifth gospel. Incessant quoting of Collins in this way proves to me that they don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d it and that they are not operating as level 5 leaders.\nYes, since Collins wrote for a business crowd about business, there is a lot that the CEO-aspiring pastor will latch onto. What he says about leadership is mostly contained within a single chapter, and it\u2019s almost an aside about the common qualities of successful leaders/CEOs. Some of the major commonalities are that they were largely unknown, they often rose from within the ranks of the company, and they are incredibly humble, not needing the limelight. They point to others following succeses, and they point to themselves following failures. How many CEO-aspiring pastors does this sound like? Precious few\u2026 or none, I\u2019d say.\nDon\u2019t let their use of Collins\u2019 work turn you off of him. There are some real nuggets in there about managing change\u2026 change from good to great. Let\u2019s say the inherited church is the \u201cgood\u201d but we\u2019re hoping to make something great. So what do we need to know about how change takes place? Now you\u2019re digging for the right stuff in Collins\u2019 book. If you want to know how to be a great grand-poobah CEO leader, there\u2019s stuff in there\u2026 but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, you won\u2019t like what you find, and you won\u2019t be properly equipped to negotiate the change being considered. That\u2019s the issue with so many of these CEO-aspiring pastors, they\u2019re not on the same page as this, and they can\u2019t even see it.\nI tend to much prefer \u201cBro.M.\u201d for obvious reasons. The inclusion of Phillip Morris is discomforting from an ethical standpoint, but considering what Collins is on about and why, it must be acknowledged that PM is or was a very well-run company in the timeframe, and as such they help to inform Collins\u2019 findings. This is one of things that\u2019s so valuable about his book\u2026 it\u2019s not a data sample of qualifying companies, it\u2019s based on all of them.\nI\u2019m curious about the monograph though, as I haven\u2019t read it. Does it genuinely add much for nonprofits, or just change a couple of the terms involved (like changing \u201cprofit\u201d in the hedgehog concept)? Mostly wondering if some of those shifts or adaptations are fairly obvious even without the companion piece.\nRobbymac, might I say, moi aussi.\nI\u2019m a fan of Collins for business. The church isn\u2019t one. I\u2019d be happy to NEVER see G2G or Built to Last in a church leader\u2019s office. My experience (scars included) suggests they\u2019ve done more harm than good.\nThe monograph makes a point of saying that non-profits should not try to run like businesses, because most businesses aren\u2019t following concepts that will lead to greatness. Collins notes that although they used businesses to identify good-to-great concepts, it was primarily because stock prices made it easy to come up with a set of guidelines to separate great companies from the rest. Collins doesn\u2019t see the priniciples as business concepts, just that businesses were used to identify them. So in the monograph, Collins says that these priniciples can be applied to the non-profit sector, including churches. But he did rework the profit-per-unit concept (what was it called, the economic denominator?) as abviously we don\u2019t measure ourselves by $$.\nOther than that I\u2019ve forgotten a lot of the monograph. After reading it I realized I needed to read the book and understand the concepts before I could appreciate the adjustments for the non-profit sector.\nAnother book worth a look is Joy at Work by Dennis Bakke. Bakke, a Christian business man, writes about the company he co-founded and the culture they created was very similar to what Collins talks about, only Bakke directly relates them to his faith, although the book is written to a secular audience.\nI\u2019m still a bit surprised by the negative reaction to church leaders using the principles of GTG. I frankly think that the church needs a good dose of a lot of what\u2019s in there. Too many Level 4 leaders, trying to bring about change through motivation strategies and one more conference, eternal optimism about the healings and revival without any reality checks. I could go on and on. But I\u2019m a bit jaded right now and probably not that balanced. What\u2019s true is true no matter where it\u2019s found. I could easily see someone trying to use the book to apply prinicples that the book is against. But then again, people do that with the Bible, too.\nI have just stunbled to this blog and am interested in the article you refer to above.\nBut cannot find the link. Would you be so kind as to email it to me, or post it here.",

    "text": "China and Finland - a burgeoning cooperation on ice. China head coach Juha Nurminen (left) together with assistant coach Hu Jiang (right).\nKites are said to rise highest against the wind, not with it. For the ascent of the Chinese dragon, a combination of inexperience and bad luck has so far seen results go against them at the 2019 IIHF World Championships Division II Group A.\nWithout any points on board so far and facing Belgium during the final day, the prerequisites for China\u00b4s senior men\u00b4s team are simple: A regular time win will keep China in the group and instead send the Belgians down to Division IIB next season.\nIt is a relegation-decider which could have major implications for China in their attempts to assert themselves in the hockey world ahead of hosting the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\nIn order to speed up the development, twelve members on the Chinese roster currently playing in Division IIA spent most of their season honing their skills deep in the Finnish forests at the Olympic Training Center in Vuokatti, 500 kilometres north of its capital Helsinki.\n\u201cWhen the players first came to Vuokatti and I talked to the players, hockey was all about who scored the most goals. Today, they talk about how to defend and first after that how you score,\u201d said China head coach Juha Nurminen, who worked with the Espoo Blues U20 team when China came calling last September.\nJumping at the chance to work with future Olympic athletes, Nurminen rolled up his sleeves and has since October last year worked intensively with 14 skaters and three goalies from its base in Finland.\n\u201cThe skill level is a bit different from a Finnish hockey player, but they learned a lot. The players came to Vuokatti with a good attitude and normally we have two sessions on ice per day. First, we work on skills for 75 minutes and then later we work on our game for another 75 minutes. I think there has been a big difference from the middle of October to this day,\u201d he said.\nWith communication initially being a challenge, Nurminen grew accustomed to speaking through an interpreter and soon threw the Chinese into the deep end with exhibition games against Finnish opponents.\n\u201cWe won against all the teams we faced from the II-division (fourth level). We then lost in overtime against Haukat Jarvenpaa from Suomi-sarja (third tier) and against the U20 team of the Espoo Blues it got a little bit too hard for us. In all these games we played good ice hockey,\u201d he said.\nIn Belgrade at the World Championship Division II Group A, it has been a mixed bag of performances so far. In China\u00b4s opener, Spain scored an empty netter to win 5-3. They followed it up with an undisciplined 0-7 loss against Croatia. China then gave away a three-goal lead in the final frame against hosts Serbia to lose 5-6. They were at it again when late penalties cost them dearly against Australia who in the end turn the game to edge China 2-3.\nIn short, a lot of room for improvements for a group of players who in less than three years should be the core of skaters to represent China at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\u201cIt is difficult to say how many of these will play at the Olympics, but most of them that are here should play for China. I don\u00b4t know where they will find other players. There are good players in both the U18 and U20 team and they have three years\u2019 time to develop. I cannot say how many will play, but someone will have to play,\u201d said Nurminen.\nChina head coach Juha Nurminen (left) together with assistant coach Hu Jiang (right) at a practice in Belgrade.\nHu Jiang is currently Nurminen\u00b4s assistant coach and also a former head coach for China when they won promotion to from the 2017 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship Division II Group B played in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\u201cHockey is a sport you need to develop long term, so right now we are doing our best to develop hockey as a sport in schools and that should help the entire country to develop more hockey players in the future,\u201d he said.\nAlso a prominent player for the Chinese national team, Jiang was at the peak of his powers at the turn of this century with a burgeoning Chinese national team.\n\u201cMy best memory from playing for China was at the 2000 World Championship C-Pool in Beijing when we got up to the B-Pool. I am glad to have been part of that team that played in that division,\u201d he said about the Chinese national team before it hit a slump in their hockey development.\n\u201cAt that time we had six to eight good, competitive teams in our national championship. Now we only have three-four. The pool of players have been diminishing drastically, which is the main reason why our hockey in China was going down,\u201d said Jiang, who also works as a coach for one of the country\u00b4s leading clubs in player development, Qiqihar in the north-eastern Heilongjiang province.\nWith a deep insight into the Chinese game, how would Jiang rate his nation\u00b4s hockey prospects at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics?\n\u201cAs the host, we like to show good performances, and since we fought long to host the Olympics, we are trying our best to prepare ice hockey. It will be a long process but we are trying our best to prepare us for it,\u201d said Jiang, who hopes for continued growth in the cooperation between China and Finland.\n\u201cWe have had a political program in winter sports between China and Finland this year. We are tightly bonded with many winter sports and we hope to extend these programs in order to develop more hockey players. From my point of view, we should continue going to a country with such a high level of ice hockey like Finland and even try to play in a league there. But that will be the decision of the supervisors of the Chinese Ice Hockey Association,\u201d said Jiang.",

    "text": "The House reconvened on Monday, March 14 for day 36 of the 2016 legislative session and an extremely busy week, as sine die (the 40th and final day of the 2016 session) is just days away. We had a busy legislative agenda this week, both on the House floor and in committee meetings as we continued to review, study and vote on legislation. With day 40 right around the corner, many more House and Senate bills received final passage this week and are now on their way to Governor Deal\u2019s desk for consideration.\nIn my short time as your State Representative, it seems that each year there is a singularly important and perhaps historic legislation that dominates the General Assembly session. During 2015, it was the Transportation Funding Act of 2015 with its record-setting $900 million tax increase. This year, it was debate about how to best protect the religious liberty of all Georgians, regardless of faith or lack thereof. This discussion has been on-going in Georgia for many years.\nProponents and supporters of religious liberty legislation cite the need to protect individuals, businesses, pastors and others from being forced to participate in activities that are in opposition to their closely and deeply held religious beliefs. Sadly, the need for religious liberty protection is clearly founded in the actions of those, particularly from the LGBTQA+ community, who would seek to force businesses, such as florists and bakeries, to sell flowers or to bake cakes for gay wedding ceremonies and when they refuse, these businesses have been forced out of business.\nPastors are being forced to take a legal and theological stand in opposition to performing gay wedding ceremonies because doing so is a direct contradiction to their biblical and religious beliefs, and when they refuse there are those who then take legal action against the pastors. There certainly are churches and denominations who accept and willingly perform gay weddings. This is their right to do so. The problem is when those who believe in gay wedding ceremonies try to legally force their beliefs upon those who disagree.\nThere are strong forces in the business community who say that Georgia, by its passage of this act is demonstrating blatant discrimination against others who disagree with their religious beliefs. This argument is patently false.\nIn the 30 states that have passed Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA) there has not been one single case of proven discrimination as a result of RFRA\u2019s passage. The argument otherwise is simply untrue.\nThis is why passage of the Free Exercise Protection Act is important for all Georgians \u2013 to protect every citizen of Georgia in the exercise of their religious beliefs. And this is why I enthusiastically supported the passage of the Free Exercise Protection Act.\nFor more details on this historic legislation please click here.\nNow, all that is needed is for Governor Deal to sign this historic legislation into law. You may show your support by contacting the Governor's office at 404-656-1776.\nRecently I announced that House Bill 219, legislation I sponsored regarding public and private pools, received final passage in the State Senate. HB 219 will now to go Governor Deal for consideration.\nI am pleased that the General Assembly recognized the importance of clarifying private property rights regarding swimming pools and for strengthening the safety of private pools in condos, townhouses and other private pools that serve a small number of property owners.\nHB 219 clarifies and redefines public versus private property pools for purposes of health and safety, and the legislation I drafted was in response to a problem with unreasonable inspections of private pools in Glynn County. The bill also strengthens the basic standards and minimum safety requirements for private pools by establishing a list of five key safety items that must pass an annual inspection: compliance with federal law regarding suction outlet covers; availability of lifesaving and rescue equipment; security of access to common pool areas; water quality; and safety of electrical systems.\nThe bill makes no changes to health and safety rules governing apartment complex pools, or private residence pools, nor does the bill change any existing pool construction codes for the State of Georgia.\nThe passage of HB 219 is the result of two years of negotiations and discussions with the Georgia Department of Health, the Georgia Realtors Association, the Georgia Apartment Association and the Georgia Association of Pool and Spa Professionals. A special thanks to Jimmy Pruett, Chairman of the House State Planning & Community Affairs Committee, who helped to resolve concerns of the Department of Public Health and see this bill through the legislative process.\nThis week, the House unanimously passed Senate Bill 364, the \u201cQuality Based Education Act,\u201d to revise annual performance evaluations for public school teachers and state mandated testing. SB 364 revises evaluations so that student growth would account for 30 percent of a teacher\u2019s evaluation, down from the current 50 percent. Additionally, professional growth would account for 20 percent, and the test component of teacher evaluations is lowered from 70 percent to 40 percent. The bill would also reduce the number of state mandated tests from 32 to 24 for students in grades K-12 by removing social studies and science milestone tests in grades 3, 4, 6, and 7. SB 364 would also ask local school systems to move all testing as close to the end of the school year as possible to ensure the students have received maximum exposure to the material prior to testing. SB 364 also adds formative testing in 1st and 2nd grades to measure progress and early learning to guarantee that all students are proficient in reading by 3rd grade and proficient in math by 5th grade. The bill is the result of multiple meetings with teachers, administrators, parents, and advocacy groups from across the state who gave input and opinions on what should be revised in the current evaluation and testing systems.\nThis legislation will give our teachers more freedom to teach Georgia\u2019s students and will take the burden off both students and teachers. Our teachers greatly influence the youth in our state, and as such, we want to provide them with the resources to have the best opportunity to succeed in the classroom so that our students have the best opportunity to succeed in the future.\nAnother bill that received unanimous passage in the House this week was Senate Bill 402, legislation that would place a moratorium on new applications for licensure of narcotic treatment programs and create a commission to study the current licensure requirements in Georgia. While current license holders would be eligible to renew their license during the moratorium, SB 402 would put a temporary freeze on issuing new narcotic treatment facility licenses through June 30, 2017. During this time, the State Commission on Narcotic Treatment Programs, established under this bill, would study the need for any changes to the licensure requirements for these programs to ensure the safety of Georgia\u2019s citizens. The commission would be tasked with examining the current narcotic treatment program licensure requirements for adequacy; assessing how the current licensure requirements and enforcement of the requirements provide adequate medical, counseling, vocational, educational, mental health assessment, and social services to patients enrolled in these programs and how these programs can be assessed for achieving recovery; determining if the geographic service areas are reasonable and balanced between population density and service proximity; determining the cause and effect of hospital admittance for overdose and incidents of suicide, if any, in relation to the adequate licensure and oversight of these programs; and hearing expert testimony on the effectiveness of nonnarcotic, medically assisted treatments for narcotic dependence and determining what legislative changes, if any, need to be made to address the commission\u2019s findings.\nThe commission would be comprised of three members from both the House and the Senate, appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Lieutenant Governor, and five members appointed by the Governor, including the commissioner of the Department of Community Health and the commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. Georgia ranks third in the nation for the highest number of narcotic treatment clinics with 62 clinics, despite the fact that we are eighth in total population. I am hopeful that this legislation will provide a solution to the increasing number of drug abuse and overdoses we see each year and ultimately save lives. There is a vital need for these treatment centers, but we must also get to the root of the issue and find out why there are so many of these facilities in Georgia.\nWe also passed Senate Bill 350 and Senate Resolution 558 this week, which would allocate tax revenue from firework sales in our state to Georgia trauma centers, fire services, and local public safety purposes. SB 350 would allocate 55 percent of the excise tax revenues from all fireworks sales in Georgia to the Georgia Trauma Care Network Commission, which was created in 2007 to maintain a trauma center network, coordinate existing trauma facilities and direct patients to the best available facility for their needs. Additionally, 40 percent of the excise tax revenues collected from firework sales would go to the Georgia Firefighter Standards and Training Commission, which provides certification standards for all firefighters, fire inspectors, fire investigators and fire and life safety educators. The funds would be used to implement a grant program to improve the equipping and training of firefighters and the rating of fire departments by the Insurance Services Office.\nFinally, five percent of the tax revenues would go to local governments to be used for public safety purposes and the operation of 9-1-1 systems. Senate Resolution 558 is the companion legislation to SB 350 and would amend the Georgia Constitution in order to allocate the excise tax funds, if approved by voter referendum on the November ballot. During the 2015 legislative session, the General Assembly passed legislation allowing the commercial sale and use of fireworks in Georgia. Should these measures receive final passage through the General Assembly and passage from Georgia voters in November, we would be able to provide a beneficial and much needed funding to the trauma, fire, and local government networks in our state by granting them the flexibility to improve and continue providing exceptional service to all Georgians.\nThe House also passed a measure this week to toughen the penalties for criminals who commit domestic violence in Georgia. Senate Bill 193 would make it a felony if a person commits family violence and has a previous conviction for family violence battery in Georgia, or in any other state. Prosecutors would be able to issue repeat family violence offenders a felony instead of another misdemeanor, closing a loophole that previously allowed some offenders to receive misdemeanor charges upon their second family battery conviction. The bill would also make the crime punishable by one to five years in prison. This legislation would strengthen our judicial system and punish violent, serial criminals, while also protecting those who they seek to harm.\nUnfortunately the Senate did not pass the Georgia Space Flight Act but instead placed the issue into a space bill study committee. According to Rep. Jason Spencer (D180-Woodbine), the Senate\u2019s decision to move the bill into a study committee was based on issues and jurisdiction that are not under state control.\nHB734, the Georgia Space Flight Act, passed the House with overwhelming support (I voted YES). After the bill moved into the Senate, the Senate Science & Technology committee decided to place the bill into a Senate study committee after spending approximately 90 minutes discussing the legislation. The Senate\u2019s primary focus was on the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s launch licensing process and applicable federal regulations as well as county zoning issues should the launch site be approved by the FAA, all of which are not under the control of the State of Georgia. Rep. Spencer pledges to bring the legislation before the General Assembly in 2017.\nThis week we passed another bill to keep Georgians safe in Senate Bill 367, a comprehensive update to Georgia\u2019s criminal justice reform legislation. SB 367 would expand Georgia\u2019s accountability courts to include \u201coperating under the influence\u201d court divisions as an alternative to the traditional justice system with the ultimate goal of reducing recidivism rates. Any court with jurisdiction over DUI or boating under the influence cases would be able to create a division of their courts to handle those cases. Similarly, any juvenile court would be able to create a \u201cfamily treatment\u201d court division to address issues within families through court intervention and the reduction of dependency. The goal of a family treatment court would be to reduce alcohol or drug abuse and addiction in child dependency proceedings; improve outcomes for families when dependency is based on alcohol or drug use and addiction; increase the personal, familial and societal accountability of defendants in child dependency proceedings; and promote effective intervention and use of resources among child welfare personnel, law enforcement, treatment providers, community agencies, and the courts. SB 367 would also allow the Department of Corrections and the Department of Juvenile Justice to operate charter schools within state juvenile justice facilities under the control of the State Charter School Commission to allow children who are incarcerated to continue to receive an education.\nFurthermore, individuals who have a suspended license as a result of a criminal conviction would be able to receive their license sooner under SB 367 by allowing time spent in prison to count toward license suspension time. The bill would also add court-mandated activities such as attending programs, treatment, and accountability court to the list of limited driving exemptions for drivers with limited driving permits. SB 367 would change the Georgia First Offender Statute to allow courts to set a date at when a defendant would be exonerated of guilt and have their criminal record restricted as long as the defendant successfully complies with the sentence and does not receive future convictions. The bill also updates probation stipulations if an individual fails to pay a fine or report to their probation officer and will now include a scheduled hearing in court. The legislation would also let inmates who have served sentences for certain drug-related offenses or repeat offenders of non-violent felonies be eligible for parole if they had no convictions for violent felonies; completed at least six years of their total sentence; were considered a low risk for recidivism; earned a high school diploma; and had no serious disciplinary violations in the past 12 months in jail. Those convicted of felony drug convictions would now be allowed to apply for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits upon their release to help ease the transition to re-entry. Finally, the bill would prohibit professional licensing boards from refusing to license an individual because of an arrest or conviction of a felony unless it directly related to the occupation they were attempting to be licensed. Legislative efforts over the past several years have made Georgia a national leader in criminal justice reform, and the modifications in SB 367 are a further example of how we can continue to be smart on crime, keep the citizens of Georgia safe, and help those who re-enter to become productive members of society. Providing alternatives to incarceration in the form of education and treatment not only allow our non-violent offenders to have a second chance at life, but will decrease recidivism rates. These efforts serve to make Georgia a safer place for all of our citizens, and I am proud of this body and the work we have done to offer those protections to our state.\nSB 206, by Sen. William T. Ligon, Jr. (R-Brunswick), revises provisions relating to the prohibition of a water supplier's option to disconnect water service to premises because of the indebtedness of a prior owner, occupant, or lessee. The bill provides a procedure to obtain information regarding moneys owed for water supplied to certain real property under certain circumstances. SB 206 exempts any property from the refusal to supply water because of the indebtedness of the prior occupant. A new section is added to current law setting forth that any property owner or tenant, person executing a contract for the purchase or occupancy of property, attorney closing a real estate transaction, or lender considering the loan of funds to be secured by real property shall have the right to request a statement from the water supplier setting forth the amount of any outstanding water charges along with any late fees with interest. Rep. Alex Atwood (R-St. Simons Island) spoke in support of the bill. He indicated that ACCG, GMA, the Georgia Realtors Association, and others are in support of this legislation. There was one amendment, but it was withdrawn.\nSR 730, by Sen. William T. Ligon, Jr. (R-Brunswick), encourages the Coastal Regional Commission to create a comprehensive plan for and oversee the implementation of the Coastal Georgia Greenway and to create and file an annual report with the General Assembly detailing its progress. I presented this bill before the House where it passed with a vote of 149-18.\nSB 263, by Sen. Bruce Thompson (R-White), allows for the governing authority of each municipality and county in this state, as well as each board of education, which employs sworn police officer who are POST certified to adopt policies under which officers may retain their weapon or badge upon retirement or leaving employment as a result of a disability arising in the line of duty. It passed the House today with a vote of 123-46.\nSR 876, by Sen. Steve Gooch (R-Dahlonega), was carried in the House by Rep. Kevin Tanner (R-Dawsonville). It seeks to establish a Joint High-Speed Broadband Communications Access for All Georgians Study Committee. No changes were made in the House Special Rules Committee where this Resolution had been assigned. This resolution passed 166-0.\nThis week, we also had a special guest stop by the House. On Monday, we were honored to have Atlanta Braves legend Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron and his wife Billye join us on the House floor, where we recognized the couple for their work in the community. Hank Aaron played 21 seasons with the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves and completed his career with two seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers. During his 23 year career, Aaron was an MLB All-Star for 21 seasons, still holding many records for most All-Star selections, a three-time Golden Glove right fielder, and the 1957 National League Most Valuable Player. Despite receiving many awards throughout his long career, Aaron is probably best remembered for his 715th homerun on April 8, 1974 which broke the previous home run record held by Babe Ruth. Since his retirement from baseball, Hank and Billye Aaron have been very active in their community, working with the Andrew Young Foundation and the Morehouse School of Medicine to advance the education of African-American citizens. Their commitment to the community is inspiring, and it was an honor to meet such a legendary couple.\nNext week will be the final week of the 2016 legislative session. On Thursday, March 24 we will convene one final time this session for legislative day 40, or \u201csine die,\u201d the last day we have to pass any legislation this year. While the end is near, there is still work to be done and many issues to be considered, and your input on these issues is very important to me. My colleagues and I will work long hours every day next week to ensure that we are doing what is best for Georgia and its citizens. If you are following legislation that you would like to see passed, or if you have any questions about the bills that the General Assembly has considered this session, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Your input will help guide my decisions during this crucial time, and I appreciate all of your feedback. You can reach me at my Capitol office at (404) 656-0126 or by email at Jeff.Jones@house.ga.gov.\nAs always, thank you for allowing be to be your representative.",

    "text": "DALLAS\u2014Seven Colombian orphans will make the trip of a lifetime as they travel to Dallas for a three-week visit with American host families this December.\nThe Angels from Abroad program provides older children a chance to learn about American culture, share their Colombian culture, and experience living in a family. It also helps raise awareness about the need for adopting older children and children who are part of a sibling group, said Denise Schoborg, director of Dillon International\u2019s Colombia program.\n\u201cEvery night in Colombia, approximately 60,000 children in the care of the country\u2019s child protection system fall asleep uncertain of what the future holds for their lives. Sadly, adoption for most of these children will never come true in their birth country where the majority of adoptions involve young, healthy children,\u201d Schoborg said.\nThe children who will be visiting through the Angels from Abroad program are ages 8 to 15, and include a sibling group of two and a sibling group of three children.\nHost families are still needed for the program. Interested families can attend free meetings May 30 and June 10 at the Dillon International office/Buckner Children and Family Services Campus in Dallas.\nWHEN: Thursday, May 30 from 12:00 to 1:30 p.m. and Monday, June 10 from 6:00 to 7:30 p.m.\nRSVP: To attend, families can contact Program Coordinator Anyra Cano at anyra@dillonadopt.com.\nDillon International is headquartered in Tulsa, Okla., and affiliated with Dallas-based Buckner International. Founded in 1972, the licensed, non-profit agency offers adoption services in Colombia, China, Korea, Haiti, India, Hong Kong and Ghana, with programs in Ethiopia and Honduras available through its affiliation with Buckner.",

    "text": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of bioactive chemical once used in industrial applications, but which now contaminate the world environment. PCBs are lipophilic with few natural degadatory mechanisms, and thus they accumulate in human and animal tissues, and are passed to subsequent generations via transfer between mother and offspring. Research has shown that PCBs can interfere with brain and sexual organ development, and adult sexual behaviors and reproduction. However, previous studies produced contradictory results based on the dose and method of administration, species, and the age at exposure. The research detailed in this thesis elucidates the effects of prenatal exposure to low levels of a commercial mixture of PCBs, Aroclor (A) 1221, on female reproductive function. The studies undertaken in this dissertation focus on three areas relevant to understanding long-term effects of PCBs on reproductive physiology in female rats: (1) developmental effects in two generations, (2) sexual behaviors in the first generation, and (3) gene expression in the first generation. In the first research section of this dissertation, the sexual and somatic development of PCB-exposed animals is investigated in first (F1) and second (F2) generation females. Dose-dependent effects are observed in both generations, and a greater number of endpoints are significantly affected in the F2, including circulating hormone levels and uterine and ovarian weight. The second research section of the dissertation explores whether sexual behaviors in the first generation of exposed animals are altered by A1221, using a paced mating paradigm designed to elucidate female-typical behaviors. Several salient behaviors are affected by PCB exposure, including likelihood to mate, mating trial pacing, and stress-related vocalizations. The third research chapter discusses the results of a genomewide microarray assay performed on the preoptic area of the brain. The preoptic area is a neuroendocrine control center implicated in regulation of reproductive physiology and behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that A1221 has long lasting and trans-generational effects on the development and behavior of exposed females, accompanied by altered gene expression in a neuroendocrine region of the brain. These findings have implications for female reproductive health and reproductive success in wildlife and humans.",

By far the dominant cover (fish holding habitat) found on Table Rock Lake is timber, the type of cover will vary but you will find the following in abundance throughout the lake.\nCREATION OF TABLE ROCK Since its creation in 1959 Table Rock Lake has been considered one of the premier multi-species fisheries in our nation. Here are a few facts about Table Rock Lake. Table Rock Lake was formed by damming the White River, it is a hydroelectric & flood-control Highland Reservoir/Impoundment not a lake, at normal pool (915 msl) its waters cover 43,100 acres with a shoreline of 745 miles, while at flood pool (931 msl) its waters cover 52,300 acres with a shoreline of 857 miles. Its maximum depth at normal pool is 220 feet & its waters are in both the state of Missouri & Arkansas with over 90% of its waters being in southwest Missouri & the balance being in northwest Arkansas. Table Rock Lake is fed by 3 major tributaries, Long Creek, the James River & the Kings River. Only 15% of the lakes shoreline has been developed, the Western or Upper Section of the lake is the more developed (busier / crowded) section with numerous facilities available, the Eastern or Lower Section of the lake is considered the quieter section with fewer recreational boaters, less traffic, & fewer facilities. Regardless of the type of facility you are looking for or are in need of they are available in either section of the lake but you will find them to be more numerous & closer together in the Western or Upper Section.\nAll are ready to make your vacation the best that it can be!",

    "text": "The online casino industry is growing rapidly, and you can find many online casinos. This increases competition among providers. Therefore, they have to find different ways to attract and retain casino players. One of the best strategies followed by gambling sites are the bonuses they offer.\nThe welcome offer is the first thing that comes to mind. However, it does not stop there, and you can find many other bonuses and promotions, for example, visit this website to check the generous bonuses it offers https://getcasinobonus.net/bonuses/betat-casino/.\nLet's begin with what you are familiar with - a detailed explanation of the welcome bonus. It is also referred to as a sign-on offer. You can avail it as soon as you create an account and make the first deposit. You will be able to withdraw your winnings when you meet the wagering requirements. This offer presupposes either money or free spins or both at the same time.\n- Free Spins. You will be eligible to play the game without any money deposit. This means that you do not get any cash, but you can spin the reels in a slot machine or roll the dice and take home your winnings after meeting the wagering requirements.\n- Phantom or Sticky Bonus. This one becomes a part of the balance and not rewarded as cash. Find this example for a better understanding. You got awarded $50 as a no deposit bonus and start playing the game. You win a game with a deposit of $100. Now, you can only withdraw $50, and not the whole amount $150. This is called a phantom bonus. You may utilise the remaining amount for placing a bet for a new game.\nThus, you can use the bonuses awarded by the providers when betting. Again, not a whole but in percentage. When you get $100 for playing a game with the house edge of 0.5%, then you can stay assured to gain $75 even after the loss of $25. You can use your bonus and hunt for gain.\nA monthly, weekly or periodically offered promotions are called the reload bonus. When you become a member of the gambling site and play the games on a regular basis, you become eligible for this offering. As the online casino business market is growing, it is required for the casino providers to offer a variety of bonuses to retain the players. Such promotions are highly appreciated by the players, and they never miss a chance to claim these.\nThis offer is often given to players and elevates them to the VIP level. Once they get to a higher level, then the other bonuses will be offered.\nOnce players start playing regularly, then the providers understand the high rollers deposit patterns and will give bonuses to attract them. For instance, some VIP players will look for challenges and will be ready to take the risk. They make high deposits and are not willing to play for small amounts. Hit or miss is their motto, but they cannot compromise in the middle. For motivating such players casino offer bonuses called VIP high roller bonus.\nA casino can also grant loyalty points for players who have used their site for a long period of time. These loyalty points are called comp points and depend on the amount of money you deposit. The comp points can be exchanged for cash or prizes. You can accumulate comp points every time you win, and as per the terms, you will be eligible to get free tickets for special events, tournaments, etc.\nThis is not a usual one as it is not offered by all providers. Only some online casinos provide this offer. This one is awarded when you refer a friend to their gambling site, and he/she creates an account and makes a deposit. After this, you can get some rewards.\nAll these bonuses look very lucrative and attractive. Beware as they may not always be straightforward. You should read the terms and conditions before you begin your journey by claiming it as there can be a hidden clause or condition which may blindfold you.\nFor instance, when you start the game assuming that you will get huge rewards, sometimes you may land up with a promotional offering in the form of free games. Also, these free game winnings might have additional conditions, and you won't withdraw your winnings just like that. Therefore, exercise caution, and you will not regret later. These bonuses will make you feel good in terms of monetary benefits and as a learning experience. Use these offers to learn and then start playing the real money games. Due to these bonuses and promotions, you will become a pro in gambling without risking a penny.",

I don't even know how to cope with it right now, let alone really review it, but I finished it moments ago and I want to get my thoughts down while they're still fresh.\nMy very first impression of the book was a mix of \"Wow, this is kind of a terrifying world\" and \"This book is obnoxiously cliche.\" However, neither of those original impressions really lingered for very long (well the first one did a bit). Addison is a girl with mental powers who lives in a secret city called the Compound. Beyond the fact that everyone who lives there has mental abilities, it's a fairly average place. Addie has the ability to Search, or view the consequences of each side of a choice placed before her. When her parents get a divorce, she Searches to decide whether or not to stay with her mother or go with her father into the normal world with the \"Norms\".\nThis is where the book evolves from average-ness into awesome-ness. Each subsequent chapter alternates between the story line of the two choices- but the choices play out as if Addie had actually made that decision. There's the story line where she stays with her mother and gets involved with the star quarterback and then there's the story line where she goes into the normal world, makes new friends and meets a normal guy who was mysteriously injured in a football game against Addie's old paranormal school.\nThe stories remain separate, but the same key plot points happen in both, and you get to see how Addie's choices play out in either story, from different viewpoints. I found it especially delightful as the reader because when a protagonist makes an important choice in a novel, I tend to spend the rest of the book wondering in the back of my mind about what would have happened if they had made a different choice. I got to see two completely different dimensions intertwined with a sinister and interesting plot and I loved it. I found myself comparing the different choices and really getting involved in the book.\nI do have one small critique though, which was that there was some minor confusion in the middle chapters of the book when the plot events in the stories coincide really closely. It was vaguely tricky to remember which chapter I was in and which life Addie was living. I blame this partially on the speed at which I read, which is terribly fast (I started and finished this book today in between class and work). Sometimes I read so fast, I don't have the time to properly record the events that I'm reading in their right order and it gets a little tangled. So if you're a fast reader, keep in mind that you might have to pause for a moment to straighten things out, but it's definitely not a reason for you to avoid this book.\nI could semi-predict what was going to happen before it happened, but I was just barely ahead of the book and it kept me on my toes. I wanted to know which choice Addie would pick when she was done searching, because I just couldn't decide ahead of time. And in the end, when she made her choice, I was amazed. Not because it was some huge break from what I expected or from the rest of the novel, but because it wasn't conventional and it was just...heartbreaking to me. The way the choices played out...it just...UGH. I really wish I could pick the plot events apart here, but I don't want to give anything anyway. I want you guys to read the book and be as surprised as I was, as engrossed as I was, and as impressed by this novel as I was.\nYES!! So glad you enjoyed it. We just read and really liked it too. (Blog post here: http://www.weheartya.com/2013/03/2-for-price-of-1-dual-narratives.html.) And sadly, yes, it's not longer, BUT there is going to be a sequel or a companion novel or something!!!\nLine we can't forget: \"You don't choose this.\"\nI really liked this book too and also had a bit of trouble keeping track as a fast reader-glad someone else has that problem!",

    "text": "Adults 65 and older will soon outnumber children for the first time in America\u2019s history, it has been revealed.\nThe US Census Bureau released new projections this year that showed the country\u2019s changing \u2013 and aging \u2013 demographics.\nBy 2030 all baby boomers will be older than age 65 and one in every five Americans will be retirement age.\nWithout a doubt, it is a good thing that people are living longer, but we are facing a Social Security crisis of unprecedented size and scope in future years. Nobody has any idea how we are going to keep the financial promises that we have made to our seniors, and neither political party has put forth a realistic plan to fix the system.\nLiving together is become more popular than marriage for young American couples, according to Census Bureau data. Fifteen percent of people in the 25-to-34 age group shared quarters with an unmarried partner this year, up from 12 percent in 2008.\nAmong those between 18 to 24, cohabitation is more prevalent today than marriage with 9 percent living with an unmarried partner versus 7 percent living with a spouse. Fifty years ago, only 0.1 percent of people between 18 and 24-year and 0.2 percent between 25 and 34 lived with an unmarried partner.\nSince 2007, fertility rates have plummeted 18 percent in large cities, 16 percent in mid-sized counties, and 12 percent in rural areas.\nAs expected, the average age that women have their first child continues to climb \u2013 now at 24.5 years old in rural counties and 27.5 in metropolitan areas.\n#4 The institution of marriage is almost becoming irrelevant in our society. At one time, having a child \u201cout of wedlock\u201d was greatly frowned upon, but now that stigma is totally gone. According to the United Nations Population Fund, 40 percent of all births in the U.S. now happen outside of marriage. But if you go back to 1970, that figure was sitting at just 10 percent.\n#5 As the middle class disintegrates, more Americans are choosing a nomadic lifestyle than ever before. Today, a million Americans are living in their RVS, and that number is rising with each passing year.\nNumbering 71 million in 2016, Millennials in the United States are approaching Baby Boomers (74 million) in population and are projected to surpass them as the nation\u2019s largest living adult generation in 2019. The Millennial generation, defined as Americans born from 1981 to 1996, corresponds to adults ages 22 to 37 in 2018.\nFrom the time they were born, the Baby Boomers have greatly defined life in America, but now that is changing. The Millennials are rapidly becoming the dominant generation in our society, and that has fundamental implications for our future.\n#7 America is turning blue. Millennials turned out in unprecedented numbers during the recent mid-term elections, and that is one of the big reasons why Democrats were able to pick up 39 seats in the House of Representatives. According to one recent survey, Americans from the age of 18 to the age of 29 favor Democrats over Republicans by a 66 percent to 32 percent margin. As older Americans die off, areas of the country that are red or purple today will increasingly be turning blue.\n#8 In recent years, migration has become one of the biggest global trends. According to the United Nations, there are now 250 million migrants around the globe, and this crisis just seems to grow with each passing year. Those that live in countries that are suffering from war, poverty or tyrannical leadership can see that life is much better in Europe and North America, and many of them are extremely desperate to secure a more promising future for themselves and for their children. But mass migration has caused tremendous problems all over Europe, and it has become a political flashpoint in the United States. As our world becomes increasingly unstable, more people than ever are going to want to migrate in the years ahead, and this is going to create great challenges.\nWithout a doubt, our world has been through a lot in recent years, but the challenges that we have faced so far are nothing compared to what is coming. Our planet is running out of clean water, oil and food. Our oceans are filling up with trillions of pieces of plastic, and animal species are going extinct at a rate that is absolutely unprecedented. Meanwhile, our political systems are being shaken, global financial systems are on the verge of collapse, and natural disasters are increasing in both frequency and intensity.\nThe pace of change is only going to become even greater, and our world is never going to be the same again.\nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is a nationally syndicated writer, media personality and political activist.

    "text": "Foxy Fortunes is an online video slot game developed by Playtech and available at most online casinos that host Playtech Vegas slots, including SlotsClub.com. Most Playtech slots are free online slots, and this one is no exception. Sample the machine before you play with actual money, or simply play the game for free as much as you\u2019d like.\nThe Foxy Fortunes slot machine has five reels, three rows and 25 bet lines. You can choose how many bet lines are active per spin, and that count will simply act as a multiplier to your bet. The game caters to low- and high-rollers alike. It has UI features like Bet Max, Auto Play and even Turbo Mode, which speeds up the reel action considerably so that you can squeeze more spins into the free time you have available.\nFoxy Fortunes has a cartoon aesthetic, and the entire theme feels a lot like a classic cartoon. The main character Foxy is a Bugs Bunny like character who\u2019s harassing a camper for grapes he\u2019s rinsed and now hung out to dry. The camper also has a hound who works feverishly to sniff Foxy out. Why the camper hung his grapes out on tree branches is anyone\u2019s guess, and it\u2019s probably best not to overthink it.\nThe symbol set includes Foxy the fox, a camper, his hound dog, a tent, a cooking pot and of course the grapes. The camper serves as the jackpot symbol, which can pay out up to 5,000 coins. The set also includes the standard poker symbols: A, K, Q, J, 10 and 9.\nFoxy Fortunes has a wild symbol that can substitute for any symbol other than the scatter symbol. The wild dual serves as a bonus symbol, and when it lands on reels 2, 3 and 4 on the same spin, the Bonfire Free Games mode is activated. This bonus includes 15 free games played at the same bet amount of the last standard spin and includes a 3x multiplier that\u2019s applied to all winnings. It\u2019s also possible to win an additional 15 free games, but 30 games overall is the max for any one free games session. The scatter symbol pays out up to 100 coins and launches the Lucky Grape Bonus with three or more. This bonus has you choose one of a six bunches of grapes to reveal a prize. There\u2019s also a random bonus available if Foxy fails to catch all six bunches as they fall from above. Finally, Foxy Fortunes offers handful of symbol subsets that can be mixed and matched to win lines: cooking pot and tent, K and A, J and Q and 9 and 10.\nThe first thing that stands out about Foxy Fortunes by Playtech is its art style. The game uses vibrant colors and has a very distinct aesthetic. All of the characters that make up the symbol set have a lot of personality and that makes them memorable. The main character Foxy is as cute as can be. Foxy Fortunes also has fun animations on the reels, good spin action and effective music and sound effects that are used to sparingly in order not to grate on the player over long play sessions. You can play for as little as a penny or as little as $0.25 with all lines active. It also has an Until feature that all online slots should include, and it allows you to set the machine to continue spinning until you win something.",

    "text": "Framing connectors are proprietary products and include fastener types such as; framing anchors, framing angles, joist, purling and beam hangers, truss plates, post caps, post anchors, sill plate anchors, steel straps and nail-on steel plates. Framing connectors are often used for different reasons, such as; their ability to provide connections within prefabricated light-frame wood trusses, their ability to resist wind uplift and seismic loads, their ability to reduce the overall depth of a floor or roof assembly, or their ability to resist higher loads than traditional nailed connections. Examples of some common framing connectors are shown in Figure 5.6, below.\nFraming connectors are made of sheet metal and are manufactured with pre-punched holes to accept nails. Standard framing connectors are commonly manufactured using 20- or 18-gauge zinc coated sheet steel. Medium and heavy-duty framing connectors can be made from heavier zinc-coated steel, usually 12-gauge and 7-gauge, respectively. The load transfer capacity of framing connectors is related to the thickness of the sheet metal as well as the number of nails used to fasten the framing connector to the wood member.\nFraming connectors are suitable for most connection geometries that use dimensional lumber that is 38 mm (2\u2033 nom.) and thicker lumber. In light-frame wood construction, framing connectors are commonly used in connections between joists and headers; rafters and plates or ridges; purlins and trusses; and studs and sill plates. Certain types of framing connectors, manufactured to fit larger wood members and carry higher loads, are also suitable for mass timber and post and beam construction.\nManufacturers of the framing connectors will specify the type and number of fasteners, along with the installation procedures that are required in order to achieve the tabulated resistance(s) of the connection. The Canadian Construction Materials Centre (CCMC), Institute for Research in Construction (IRC), produce evaluation reports that document resistance values of framing connectors, which are derived from testing results.",

How do I fix this?\nRegarding the error code 815, I suggest contacting ISP to confirm if the username and password is correct.\n1. Click Start, type user account, and click the User Accounts control panel.\n2. In the User Account control panel, click Manager another account.\n3. Click Create a new account, type an account name, select Administrator, and then click Create Account.\n4. Logoff and logon with the new account and establish the connection to check if the issue persists.\nEven Iam getting the same error message 815, Can anyone solve this problem? I Know there is no problem in my internet connection as there is no such error when connected other Windows versions other than Vistas.\nI have tried your solution listed above and it does not work either. Other suggestions?\nI have also been going through the same issues with error 815 when trying to connect to the internet with the vista platform. However, I hope that my solution might work for you as well. After multiple hours on the phone with tech guys they suggested that my modem that I was worked just fine with my old computer that was running XP might be of issue. So we borrowed a friends newer modem and bing we were online. So check your modems they may need to be relaced with newer ones. Hope that helps.\nWhat would cause this problem? Or is a glitch in Vista ?\nEdited by Kristoff-Rockaz Saturday, January 10, 2009 1:39 AM .\nI think it's not Vista problem. First, log in with administrator account and check whether you network adapter gets correct IP address from server. If it's not default 169.x.x.x then create VPN connection and try to connect. If it's not connecting then call your provider tech support.\nIn my case i have a desktop running XP and i got a new lappie running vista.. So i what i used to do was to directly plug my Ethernet cord into my lappie from my PC.\nBut since that was earlier connected to my xp machine , My modem was holding some configuration related win XP (I reckon).\nI tried diagnose and it recommended me to try and turn off and then turn on my modem. And that clicked !!!!\nanyone tried getting latest product drivers for modem, I had an 815 this evening, downloaded the driver from maufacturer website for vista installed the driver, connected the device AFTER, enterd credentials and wey hey!! were done. This seems to resolve any USB connection issues. Hope this helps some folks!!\nas for ethernet modems, makesure your PPP settings are okay, your VPI/VCI are correct your username and passwords are great. your modem has the latest firmware. if this fails try resetting your TCP/IP stack and flushing DNS and then maybe winsock reset. If they don't work try an alternate modem/router of a friend if possible.\nalso when connecting you modem to another pc may sound silly but turn it off 1st otherwise the modem is still issuing an IP address to your old pc and cannot send correct packet data to your new one.\nSAYAN045 you are a God amongst your kind - I've been f-ing about trying to fix this forever & had given up on trying. Many thanks from sunny (not) England mate.\n1. Click Start , type user account , and click the User Accounts control panel.\n2. In the User Account control panel, click Manager another account .\n3. Click Create a new account , type an account name, select Administrator , and then click Create Account .\nActually the error message you encounter is that windows Vista automatically default your connection in broadband connection powered by a username and password (PPPoE). If your connection doesn't have username and password, all you need to do is disable it.\n1. Go to Internet Explorer. click on Tools Tab and go to Internet Option. under Connections tab click on option Never dial a connection, then click on Apply.\n2. If your using a PPPoE connection, input your username and password. If still persist, check your LAN status, setup and cables.\nNote: If you have a router you might need to input your username and password to your router and make sure to follow again the number 1 instruction.\nWhat if your computer still won't connect to the computer after creating an administrator account? We received the error 815 and are using Vista.\n\"Regarding the error code 815, I suggest contacting ISP to confirm if the username and password is correct.\nI am using Vista and I keep getting this error message 815 saying\"error connecting broadband connection WAN Miniport (PPPOE). How do I fix this?\n''The User Profile Service service failed the logon.\nI was having the same issue as everyone else, though i'd already been using the internet minutes before, did something else came back and got this error, i search this answer on my partners computer which was hooked up to the same router, so i knew there was no issue there, tried out Badasskick's solution, and it worked a treat, for some reason my IE had decided to change its settings, not sure what i did to make that happen, but so glad its resolved.\nI use Vista btw, my partners is XP.\nI am using Virgin Media boardbrand and I keep getting this error message 815 saying \"error connecting broadband connection WAN Miniport (PPPOE). How do I fix this? Thanks in advance!\nHow do you do this? I can't find the option.",

You can customize the format as per your requirements. See $ man strftime for more help.\n$wx$h are part of the scrot's internal specifiers.\nSo the final file name will look something like 2018-06-17_02:52:19_1365x384.png.\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Combined these allow for multiple flow-through environments free of the daily fluctuations in external temperature. These chambers are ideal for investigations into the interactive effects of temperature and other stressors, while also providing a temperature-controlled environment for process studies of basic organismal function.\nMore information about the inverted microscope can be found on the Micropscopy and Image Analysis Facility page.\nCurrent research being conducted in the BIOS ECRF includes this investigation into the physics and ecology of sea butterflies.",

    "text": "I think it is accurate to state that the flood story in the bible is both myth and a forgery. It is obviously a myth for reasons too numerous to mention here, but it is also copied from other cultures/religions, thus making it a forgery.\nIt could very well be a myth. While some scholars believe the story is a myth, National Geographic put together a documentary called \u201cIn Search for Noah\u2019s Flood\u201d. They discuss various flood stories, and make the case that a large, localized flood must have influenced these various cultures to write of this flood. While there is no proof of a flood, it seems like a plausible explanation.\nI wonder whether there is a sense in which archaeological evidence fits a normal distribution, i.e. the more you dig the more you confirm the norm.\nIn addition, I think the difficulty of archaeology and the bible concerns the way that the authors and redactors have used contemporary (to them) references, sites and concerns to illustrate the position that they have assumed. Hence trying to unpack how these texts have been assembled will be a major problem in trying to assign archaeological dates or evidence to them.\nbtw, Ronan Head gives an excellent presentation on Biblical Archaeology.\nI learned Biblical Archaeology digging in Israel. I was caught off guard recently when one of the schools I attended (a Baptist and Evangelical school) published a pro-Book of Mormon article! Really! Reading this blog, then that article is like reading opposite worlds collide. Have you heard of a Baptist journal publishing a pro-Book of Mormon article?\nI know LDS apologists love parallels, and they\u2019re great at finding them. The next step is to harness the parallel-finding to some rigorous statistical analysis, trying to actually quantify the odds of Joseph Smith coming up with \u201cNahom\u201d on his own.\nThe odds of the latter scenario, I\u2019ve just calculated through a proprietary algorithm as 1 in 10.\n\u201cIn his landmark collection Leaves of Grass, famed poet Walt Whitman wrote of a \u201cstrange huge meteor-procession\u201d in such vivid detail that scholars have debated the possible inspiration for decades.\nI have links to the articles, but I am not sure how to link in the post, sorry.\nI find it very interesting that so much remains to be discovered, and sometimes rediscovered. I am certainly less than convinced by general no-evidence claims.\nMore compelling than the external evidence for the Book of Mormon is the internal evidence for the Book of Mormon. Finding ancient cultures in the Book of Mormon has been much easier than finding the Book of Mormon in ancient cultures. That is to be expected.\nNow the question is whether your proprietary algorithm accurately predicts the odds. What if it is more like 1/100 instead of 1/10? Now it becomes even more impressive.\nI think we gamble when we attempt to assign specific numerical likelihoods in this manner. All it will take is one obscure children\u2019s book from Joseph Smith\u2019s immediate culture, one 1820s newspaper article, one heretofore unnoticed Bible dictionary quoting Carsten Niebuhr or those who came after him (describing Nehhm, near Sana, before 1829), and the odds will be shot all to goodness-gracious. I find an average of one fresh and interesting new Mormon parallel source every couple of weeks, and I am only one researcher. The jury is still out.\nSteve, a few years ago, Grace for Grace published an article about a Baptist Preacher that believes in the Book of Mormon.\nThe old world findings are exciting, but the quoted enthusiasm is a bit over stated. The letters NHM were found carved into stone in lower Saudi Arabia near the Red Sea. As I understand it, NHM is thought to be a tribal name, not necessarily a place name. There is a semi-suitable Wadi directly East of where NHM was found as a possible location for Bountiful. That\u2019s it. If fits nicely into our Book of Mormon narrative, but I withhold my enthusiasm until this evidence gains traction in a secular peer reviewed publication. The Book of Mormon, as a secular history, would be the most astounding document is secular American studies ever known if it\u2019s historicity were supported by evidence. Until we see Book of Mormon scholarship accepted by and spread into a secular forum, I withhold my exuberance over perceived evidence.\nI also withhold my enthusiasm. The probability of rolling 4 sixes in a game of Yahtzee may be 1/1296, but you have to account for how many rolls you get.\nHow many rolls do you get to find one that matches the BofM NHM? I can\u2019t really say how many place names there are in the area and time period that would count as a hit.\nI think the analogy between the \u201chistory\u201d of the BoM and the \u201chistory\u201d of the Bible is a little misleading. The Bible is a collection of books written over centuries based on centuries\u2019 old telling of stories passed through oral tradition. It\u2019s not a great leap to acknowledge that (a) it is unlikely these stories represent, or are even supposed to represent actual occurrences and (b) it is likely that there is some historical truth to them and \u201cclose\u201d archeological evidence will exist to support he genesis of these stories.\nThe Book of Mormon, on the other hand, was presented by an individual claiming to have been given the book through supernatural means. One can draw no conclusions as to the veracity of the stories therein without first accepting the claims of the individual.\nTo illustrate using your example of Sodom vs. Nahom. The evidence indicating a city that my have been Sodom is easier to digest because no one questions that this story was indeed told for centuries and was indeed written down by someone. That there may be some truth to the story is highly believable, even likely. Nahom, on the other hand, would need far more evidence to a non-believer. In the case of Sodom, the bible is evidence (not necessarily high quality, but evidence nonetheless) of the potential for such a city to exist \u2013 so when you add archeological evidence, you increase the likelihood of existence.\nWithout belief in JS Jr first, the fact that the BoM discusses a city named Nahom offers no objective evidence of its existence \u2013 so any archeological evidence would have to stand on its own.\nI love your posts! While I am interested in BoM archaeology, it is lower on my priority lists right now. Since I stopped viewing everything through the \u201cBoM is historical\u201d lens, I think it\u2019s pretty hard to convince anyone (non-believer) that the BoM is historical via archaeology. I think it relies very heavily on apologist enthusiasm and fun hypothetical statistics that impress.\nHowever, I do want to mention what I think is a problem (though I confess I have not read much into BoM archaeology). It seems to me that most of the work done in BoM and Biblical archaeology is done by believers (since they believe they\u2019ll find something). How many \u201cimpartial\u201d archaeologists for the BoM or the Bible are there? 1, 2, 10 maybe? Does that mean anything? I think it does. But what would we expect from archaeologists who have an unquestioning loyalty to their goal of proving their book? I don\u2019t want to cast doubt on all the good scientific work done by the likes of John Sorenson, I just think there needs to be more divested scholarship looking at the issues and evidence.\nchicken, one issue I have with you comment is the fact that sodom was around 3000 years ago. if we wait another 3000 years, then the bom may seem plausible as well based strictly on the fact that we have been telling stories about lehi and laman for 3000 years.\njmb, when I look at biblical archaeology, there are no \u2018unbiased\u2019 archaeologists (just like the bom). I really like william dever of the university of arizona because he seems pretty unbiased to me, but even he allows that the story of samson could be based in fact because of a philistine vase that shows a man standing between 2 pillars. it could represent the fantastic story of samson collapsing a philistine temple. yet I think most scholars question whether a person could really collapse a building. the story bears more resemblance to hercules than fact, yet there are some biblical apologists that say the story could be plausible.\nI think that mormons are so used to defending the bom, that we aren\u2019t even aware of similar criticisms about the bible. after all, evangelicals aren\u2019t going to volunteer unflattering info about the bible, and it is easy for both mormons and evangelicals to write off atheists.\n\u2026 Dr. John Clark of the New World Archaeological Foundation has compiled a list of sixty items mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The list includes items such as \u201csteel swords,\u201d \u201cbarley,\u201d \u201ccement,\u201d \u201cthrones,\u201d and literacy. In 1842, only eight (or 13.3%) of those sixty items were confirmed by archaeological evidence. Thus, in the mid-nineteenth century, archaeology provided little support for the claims made by the Book of Mormon. In fact, the Book of Mormon text ran counter to both expert and popular ideas about ancient America in the early 1800s.\nAs the efforts of archaeology have shed light on the ancient New World, we find in 2005 that forty-five of those sixty items (75%) have been confirmed. Thirty-five of the items (58%) have been definitively confirmed by archaeological evidence and ten items (17%) have received possible\u2014tentative, yet not fully verified\u2014confirmation.\nThat\u2019s a decent trend line.\nEssentially, the best available evidence is never perfect evidence, it is merely \u201cbest available.\u201d When scholars and scientists mistake \u201cbest\u201d evidence for \u201cperfect\u201d evidence they overstate their own knowledge in a kind of hubris, not seeing what they don\u2019t know, and giving too much weight for what they think they do know. (Rhetorially) Just ask \u201cexperts\u201d in geocentric astronomy, biologic spontaneous generation, or phrenology.\nIt\u2019s not that Sodom has been talked about \u2013 its about the chicken and the egg. What I mean is, Bible stories were stories passed down for generations and then written down. The discussions about the BoM are not a result of stories and experiences, they are a result of an individual writing the stories down first, beginning a discussion. Under the former, the experiences and stories beget a writing evidencing the experiences and stories, under the latter, a writing begat stories, evidencing only what we choose to believe.\nn, thanks for your comment. I think it well illustrates the idea that \u2018the more you dig, the more you find.\u2019 there are far too many that seem to have closed the book on future discoveries, and think that the current lack of evidence is evidence of lack.\nchicken, I agree that this is a bit of a chicken or egg argument. but I think the main concept remains. can a bible or bom believer convince a non-bible/bom believer that his position is correct (and vice versa)? I think the answer is \u2018no.\u2019 bible and bom believers have a supposition of historicity. non believers have a supposition of non historicity. therin lies a problem-conflicting assumptions. I don\u2019t know of a way around that. for example, if you believe noah\u2019s flood is a myth, is there any amount of evidence that can change your mind?\nThe 1/10 odds were of the alternative scenario I hypothesized (Joseph Smith uses a variant on the known-to-him Semitic name name \u201cNahum\u201d (\u201ccomforter\u201d), whose meaning he reasonably could have learned from his Bible-infused culture, in connection with an event \u2014 the death of a beloved family member \u2014 where comfort is typically sought. The \u201cproprietary algorithm\u201d consists of me pulling the number out of a hat.\nRe: Peterson\u2019s description of the \u201cexact name\u201d of Nahom and the \u201cexact place,\u201d we don\u2019t have either. We have three letters \u2014 NHM \u2014 which may \u201cNahom\u201d, or it may be Nihm or Nahm or Nuhum or any other variation. Not quite \u201cexact.\u201d As for \u201cexact place,\u201d we have \u2014 southern Arabia. A big bulls-eye, especially given Lehi\u2019s party\u2019s literally years of wandering.\nSo: What are the odds of a Semitic placename existing somewhere in the Semitic-occupied territory in which Joseph Smith set the Book of Mormon, that has some potential similarity to a placename that might be invented by someone who was trying to invent Semitic-sounding placenames, with the Bible and potentially Biblical commentary or others\u2019 knowledge as a reference?\nIf \u201cNHM\u201d is evidence that the Book of Mormon is a record of activities in the Old World, because of a passable resemblance of a Book of Mormon placename to an Old World placename, then why is not the Hill Onidah (cf. \u201cOneida,\u201d a New York State Indian tribe) evidence that it is the product of contemporary upstate New York? As long as we\u2019re calculating odds, what are the chances of an Indian tribe in Joseph\u2019s neighborhood sharing a name with a place in (presumably) Mesoamerica? I\u2019m not aware of any connection between the Iroquoian language group and any of the Mesoamerican language families.\nIf \u201cNHM\u201d is the crown jewel of apologetics, that\u2019s not a good sign.\nI\u2019d like to see the definition of \u201cconfirmed\u201d used here. I\u2019ve seen apologists get excited about a Mesoamerican quarry of ochre (a reddish iron-containing pigment), as if it helped confirm the Book of Mormon\u2019s reference to use of iron and steel metal. There\u2019s a fair gap between a bunch of half-naked tribesmen smearing reddish ochre on their faces, and a blacksmith making a steel sword.\nMH \u2013 I think you are talking apples and oranges. Everyone \u201cbelieves\u201d in the Bible \u2013 ie. that the Bible is a series of writings complied over centuries about the faith journey of multiple people over that time. Some of taken this to the extreme and view that, through divine intervention, the Bible is literally the Word of God and miraculous historical, others don\u2019t. But no one disputes the history of the Book itself and how it was written and compiled.\nThe BoM, on the other hand, is the opposite. This a book where even the most ardent believer acknowledges that it was a newly found document claiming to be written by particular individuals of particular historial facts. If you believe JS Jr\u2019s story, then you can start comparing the tales of the BoM with the tales of the Bible and applying archeological and historical references. But that\u2019s a big leap. Most of us will deny the divinity of any religious tome not of our own religion (ie. most Christians don\u2019t believe in the divinity of Muhammed notwithstanding a perfectly good book attesting to that fact).\nWhat you are noting is that one cannot convince someone else of something supernatural if they do not believe. I agree. But the very existence of the BoM \u201crelies\u201d on the supernatural event. Not so with the Bible. As such, if archeological evidence suggests, even peripherally, the existence of the city of Sodom \u2013 even a skeptic may say \u201csure, maybe such a city did exist, that would explain the oral tradition involving the city that was recorded by ancient people.\u201d But if you have archeological evidence that suggests the city of Nahom exists, most objective observers would assume their was an alternatiev explanation, as there is no long-standing and multi-generational historical tradition, merely a book that is admittedly in existence by supernatural means.\nSure. A worldwide flood layer dated prior to 2000 BC. It doesn\u2019t exist. Although absence of evidence is not always evidence of absence, where evidence should reasonably likely have been left, then yes, absence of evidence that ought to be there is evidence of absence.\nAlternatively, you could present geological evidence that the continents were virtually flat in antediluvian times, and Mt. Ararat was a molehill, such that you could possibly have enough water in the atmosphere to raise sea levels enough to actually drown people (as opposed to making the wicked mildly annoyed at sloshing around ankle-deep floodwater for forty days) without having to posit an atmospheric pressure similar to Venus\u2019s, which would have cooked and imploded Noah and his fellows.\nSo there is evidence that could change my mind re: Noah. It\u2019s just that the best evidence is that we\u2019re extremely unlikely ever to find it, and so the best working hypothesis is that Noah\u2019s flood is a myth.\nWell, yes and no. It\u2019s possible, and much argued over, that the Book of Deuteronomy was invented out of whole cloth by religious partisans long after its supposed writing by Moses, similar to how critics of the Book of Mormon suggest Joseph may have done with the Book of Mormon.\nWell said. And again, we are talking about evidence of stories withing the Bible, where the BOM itslef (as opposed to its contents) requires substantial evidence of its supernatural origins. So while stories of even some books of the Bible must overcome \u201cthe best working hypothesis\u201d it is the BoM itself which, absent extraordinary evidence, will be presumed mythical by non-believers.\nThis is why archeological \u201cproofs\u201d fall so far short from convincing objective reviewers of the BoM\u2019s authenticity.\nD\u2019Anville\u2019s 1751 map of Asia and Niebuhr\u2019s 1771 map of Yemen are the basis for most of the accurate maps of Arabia from 1751 to 1814. With D\u2019Anville\u2019s indisputable reputation for accuracy and with Niebuhr\u2019s firsthand experience and use of scientific instruments, in addition to the difficulty in mapping Arabia, most reputable cartographers relied on D\u2019Anville and Niebhur in publishing maps of Arabia. Bonne, Cary, Darton, and Thomson, however, all seemed to have their own sources for information on Arabia and Nehem.\nNot really so, in many instances. To take steel swords, the first example above, they were quite dramatically described in the James Macpherson\u2019s Ossian poems beginning in the mid-1700s (and very widely published and accepted throughout Europe and America). Cement was certainly a part of young Joseph Smith\u2019s world, used to construct the Erie Canal. Another of Dr. Clark\u2019s claims I have seen is his notion that the idea of a King (Benjamin) working with his own hands would have seemed unlikely to someone of Joseph Smith\u2019s time: most certainly not the case. Such things are readily available in the nineteenth century culture, but to know about them, one has to want to find them.\nRegarding the easily-accessed names of Naham and Nahum -and many others for the Book of Mormon, the following .pdf document may be of interest to some readers . . .\nChicken #20, \u201cBut the very existence of the BoM \u201crelies\u201d on the supernatural event. Not so with the Bible\u201d Yes, Chicken, but there are some very supernatural events\u2013primarily in the Book of Genesis that all rely on supernatural events. Your point that \u201cthe Bible is a series of writings complied over centuries about the faith journey of multiple people over that time\u201d will be similar to the Book of Mormon in 3000 years.\nThomas, I think most Biblical apologists assume the flood was a large localized flood, rather than a worldwide flood as I mentioned about the National Geographic special in the OP. Certainly it would be easier to find a localized flood than a worldwide flood. Your point about Deuteronomy is well taken. I\u2019ve been planning to write on that for quite some time, but I haven\u2019t had enough time to research it good enough to put a post together. It\u2019s been called a \u201cpious fraud\u201d just like the Book of Mormon.\nDoug, welcome back. It\u2019s been a while, and we\u2019re sparring about Nahom again. If Emma states that Joseph didn\u2019t know there were walls around Jerusalem, how did he have a chance to look at these expensive maps?\nRick, your points are well taken, but my question to Doug applies to you as well.\nWhat about the ark? Pretty skeptical but when this popped up a few months ago, it really startled me.\nMH \u2013 you\u2019re not understanding me and it\u2019s probably because I\u2019m not being clear. I\u2019m not talking about events recorded in, or stories recounted. Yes the bible contains stories of supernatural, but the telling, collecting and writing of those stories was done by very natural means. The BoM, even if it contained nothing more than recipes would still be more suspect as the actual discovery and writing of the BoM is supernatural.\nI can disregard the supernatural stories of the Bible as myth, exagerration, etc. and still believe the Bible is a record of the stories and spiritual journey of the people who wrote it \u2013 I may also believe that other stories contain truth.. If I similarly disregard the supernatural with respect to the BoM, then it means JS Jr. is fraudulent. If that is the case, I don\u2019t even get to whether Nahom exists or whether cows can cross the ocean in a clam shell.\nThere\u2019s one other issue I\u2019d like to weigh in on with regards to archaeology and the BoM and Bible. Suppose you were an independent, impartial observer, and were interested in the historicity of the BoM. You ask where it supposedly took place. You ask where Joseph Smith said it took place. A large group of believing scholars have a whole mess of evidence, statistics, quotes, etc. that go some way in convincing you that it happened somewhere in Central America. But you then learn there is an entirely other crowd of believing scholars who also have a whole mess of evidence, statistics, quotes, etc. that it happened in North America near the Northeast. Now what?\nMy point is that the apologists themselves do not even have a cohesive cogent argument for a single theory. Rather, there\u2019s a whole mess of theories, even amongst believers. How are we supposed to convince non-members, or doubting members about the historicity of a book when we can\u2019t even agree on the evidence amongst believers? They would have a much better argument if they all backed a single theory. But the fact that there are a myriad theories is evidence that there isn\u2019t that much convincing evidence!\nMy experience is that most members sort of tacitly believe that the events of the BoM took place in Central America somewhere. They haven\u2019t really investigated, but that\u2019s what they would loosely claim to a non-member. Yet, there is no official church position, no internal agreement among non-believing scholars, or even believing scholars.\nok chicken, I see your distinction, but I must confess that it seems a bit of splitting hairs to me. at least you\u2019re consistent in calling both the bible and bom as myth. quite often, most bible believers are willing to call the bom myth, but bristle at calling the bible myth.\njmb, you points are well taken. it would be nice to have a single, unified theory. but I am not bothered by all the theories, because the brainstorming is a good, necessary process. if we put all our eggs in one basket, we may miss something important.\nmultiple geography theories are not without precedent. there are at least 13 theories that I am aware of detailing the route of the exodus. there are several locations for mount sinai. my personal belief is that mt sinai is located at jebel-musa in saudi arabia. scholars hotly contest these locations, but nearly everyone agrees that the traditional mt sinai is incorrect.\nI think all the bom geography theories are similar to the exodus/sinai debate. I don\u2019t know if you remember my malay post (311 comments), but that theory removes nearly all anachronisms that american theories have. of course it has its own problems as well.\nI quite like Chicken\u2019s point. The Bible has more \u201ctruth,\u201d as it were (at least to a non-Mormon), from the get-go because it has been with us for years and because it is couched in familiar mythological tales that have been woven into a well known book. So even if you believe it\u2019s all myth, the archeology has a chance of having a shred of truth just because myths generally have some scrap of truth. Hence, it\u2019s not hard to buy into a potential site for Sodom even if the actual facts surrounding the city are not even close to what\u2019s in the OT.\nThe BoM, OTOH, is not a collection of myths (at least that\u2019s not the claim). It\u2019s origin is supernatural to begin with, not based on myths. It\u2019s not as if Mormon handed down some book or oral tradition to his progenitors who perhaps wrote it down or rewrote it, changed, and/or modified it eventually falling into the hands of JS. No, the entire story begins with an angel and gold plates buried in a hill. There\u2019s a major discontinuity between what allegedly happened with the Nephites and when the book came into existence as we know it. It\u2019s a \u201cnew\u201d myth, story, civilization, etc. that originated with Joseph (even if you believe it\u2019s historical, the BoM, as we know it in English, originated with Joseph). So when archeology is presented as evidence it is easy to postulate an alternative explanation as there is no agreed upon mythology about this civilization.\nTo the independent scholar, to use the BoM as a guide to the civilization in Central America is to concede the supernatural events and belive Joseph Smith. On the contrary, for the Bible archeologists, he/she need not believe the bible to be historical and still find evidence of a city mentioned therein.\nOh, I absolutely agree with you. I\u2019m not personally bothered by the many theories either. I\u2019m just saying that to the non-believer it is hard to make a convincing argument about the historical nature of the BoM (of which we are so sure) when there is not even an internally consistent theory about the historical nature of it.\nI am going to disagree with jmb and chicken about the bible not being supernatural in origin. there was no bible prior to moses. he received the original scripture-the 10 commandments by the finger of the lord. surely this is just as fantastic as the gold plates. then they wrote the story of moses life with the plagues etc. then moses had the fantastic story of adam and eve revealed to him.\nI did a post about a recent book (published by oxford I believe) asking if moses plagiarized hammurabi\u2019s code. if moses were contemporary and joseph smith were ancient, I think we would have just as many questions about the supernatural events of moses as we do the gold plates.\nI agree \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s splitting hairs. The Bible is NOT a myth \u2013 it CONTAINS mythical stories. If you don\u2019t believe in the supernatural at all \u2013 you would still beleive the bible exists and contains stories told for ages \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t beleive anything about the BoM.\nAnd this is how it relates to archeology. Archeologists might use the Bible as clues to what archeological finds mean or even evidence to search for archeological items \u2013 because the Bible, is in fact, ancient stories and therefore at least theoretically points to ancient places and events \u2013 even if oune discounts entirely supernatural claims. But, if one discounts supernatural claims, then one would not use the BoM as evidence of historical fact or relate archeological evidence to BoM claims.\nIn an unsensitive analogy, if one does not believe in the supernatural in general, or JS Jr\u2019s claims specifically, one would consdier the BoM to be entirely fictional \u2013 just like, say the Chronicles of Narnia. If one were to discover through archeological means, an ancient site with 4 thrones and statues of giant lions \u2013 one would not consider that this was a an indication that this was Narnia \u2013 any more than the finding of a plaque with NHM upon it would indicate the existence of a fictional place.\nWith the BoM \u2013 belief must come first. Everything else hinges upon that. With the Bible, belief is optional \u2013 because everyone understands it is a work containing ancient writings \u2013 not so with the BoM.\nBut you\u2019re not suggesting that ALL of the Bible is supernatural in origin? And that\u2019s the difference. The whole of the BoM is in the supernatural-origin camp. Perhaps there was no bible prior to moses, but there were, in fact, numerous myths about deluges, myths about God creating man and woman, etc. Besides, Moses didn\u2019t come down from Mt. Sinai and write about it. There is considerable doubt as to the authorship and chronology of the pentateuch, which COULD mean it is also CONTAINS myth.\nI don\u2019t think any of this discredits the archeology or anything. It\u2019s just easy to see why there would be non believing bible archeologists who still try to fit their findings with the Bible (to some degree) and why there would likely be no such non believing BoM archeologists.\nMaybe I\u2019m not seeing Chicken\u2019s argument either, I dunno.\nMh \u2013 you\u2019re even assuming there was such a person as Moses \u2013 he could be made up out of wholecloth. Nontheless, ancients kept record of their spiritual journey. Eventually these were written down and, more recently compiled into the old Testament. Again though, your only talking about particular portions of the bible and, more to the point, particular things IN the Bible. THe Bible itself was not pulled from a tree or dug from the gound. It was compiled from anceint records.\nJMB275 \u2013 so you think non-believers would consider the archeological find similar to Narnia proof of the historicity of C.S. Lewis\u2019 books? Would you condone further searchers for additional archeological proofs? Of course not \u2013 because we know the Narnia books are fiction. Non-believers similarly know the BoM is ficition.\nHmmm, you should read my comments again. I\u2019m agreeing with you.\nchicken, I still think you\u2019re looking at this too narrow. the book of mormon is more like the book of genesis than the entire bible. (perhaps we could include the bible up until the time of jeremiah, since the archaeological data prior to david/solomon is scant.\nnow, assuming that mosos (or perhaps baruch) was the first to write down oral traditions into the bible, then the bible can be considered a collected of myths. there is little, if any proof of biblical archaeology prior to 700 bc (some may push that back to 1100 bc). after 700 bc, we do seem to have some evidence. so the origins of the bible can be considered just as supernatural as the bom.\nnow the bible post 700 bc is more like the d&c period of mormonism. we can find proof of locations of independence, slc, manti, just as we find jericho, jerusalem, and armageddon. 3000 years from now, archaeologists may confirm slc as a headquarters, and may discover lds and rlds versions of d&c. perhaps they may never discover the garden of eden or the city of zarahemla-perhaps they will find zarahemla in malaysia. bom archaeology is infantile compared to the 3000 years of the bible, or at least the past 2700 years.\nAssumes Emma and/or Joseph didn\u2019t make that episode up, in an early effort to bolster the \u201cJoseph was so ignorant, he couldn\u2019t possibly have invented the Book of Mormon himself\u201d argument.\nare you saying that emma made it up?\n#42 \u2014 Emma or Joseph. And yes, most likely. I find it impossible to believe that Joseph Smith, who was clearly familiar with the King James Bible even if it\u2019s not clear when he first read it through, could possibly have overlooked all the biblical references to Jerusalem\u2019s walls.\nAlternatively, even if Emma were accurately relating a conversation that actually took place, there\u2019s no reason why Joseph couldn\u2019t have had a gap in his knowledge about Jerusalem\u2019s city infrastructure, and still had access to a map. NHM is a weak reed.\nNo. The origins of the bible is that people wrote down oral tradition and long-told stories. The origins of the BoM is that a young man claims to have been given the book by an angel. If all Genesis discussed was supernatural fantasy and all the BoM discussed were 100% proven facts, the origin of the former would be natural and the latter would be supernatural.\nIf one were to disregard the supernatural \u2013 one would look at the writings of Genesis and disregard them as fantasy \u2013 one would not even look at the BoM as they would disregard it as fantasy ab initio. That\u2019s the difference.\nchicken, I still don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking at time here. if the bom was 3000 years ago and genesis was 200 years ago, we would have 3000 years of oral history of the bom. genesis would have no such history, and would be seen just as unreliable as you view the bom today.\nI agree that Joseph Smith would not likely have seen the more expensive maps. But here, we must begin to espouse a more sophisticated philosophy of cultural background if we are ever to transcend the somewhat adolescent stage of Mormon historiography whenever it explores parallels. Specific parallel sources (like the above expensive maps) are not so much candidates of particular borrowing, as they are indicators of a general, broad and available culture.\nI was somewhat troubled \u2013 maybe amused \u2013 by a wholly unimaginative approach offered on this topic by S. Kent Brown in his article, \u201cNew Light from Arabia on Lehi\u2019s Trail\u201d in Donald W. Parry, Daniel C. Peterson and John W. Welch, eds., Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon. (Provo, Utah: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies [FARMS], ), 55-125.\nDr. Brown there reviewed published sources of Joseph Smith\u2019s time that mentioned or discussed the NHM region in southern Arabia, or showed it on maps. He rendered a valuable service by summarizing such works he had located (Brown, 72-75). But since his focus was entirely faith-promoting, calculated to minimize potential significance to Joseph Smith\u2019s environment, Brown became as mathematical as some commenters on the present post here, and suggested that information from pre-1829 sources could not have reached Joseph Smith unless Joseph personally read those actual books \u2013and then only at one of two specified libraries, named in the article, near which Joseph lived when he was a boy or a young man. Dr. Brown went to considerable effort to demonstrate that those libraries did not have Niebuhr\u2019s work (Brown 2002, 69-75).\nI will stipulate readily that Joseph Smith probably seldom thought of visiting Dartmouth College\u2019s library when he was ten years old, even though it was only an hour\u2019s walk from home. And, I probably have even less confidence than might Dr. Brown, that Joseph Smith likely spent any time patronizing the Manchester, New York membership lending library. But to ask the wrong questions (or to limit potential sources so) is as bad as to erect a straw man, and it gets us no closer to responsible history than if we were to hide our heads in the sand. As I wrote in my own work . . .\nHistory has given us an \u201cAmerican Prophet\u201d who needs to be explained in terms of divine revelation, rational synthesis, or something in between. It really does not matter whether Joseph Smith actually read any specific manuscript or book, because an entire culture is on display. We are scarcely dealing here with issues of pointed study or conscious borrowing. No single one of these writings was essential to the work of Joseph Smith, and this Bibliographic Source hangs upon no individual concept \u2013 upon no particular text. It is, rather, the very existence of the Mormon parallels which these sources display \u2013 in such great number, distribution, and uncanny resemblance to the literary, doctrinal and social structures which Joseph formed \u2013 which may command our attention.\ninteresting quote rick. I should check out your book.\nit seems to me that we have 2 versions of joseph smith: (1) a dumb guy with a 3rd grade education that translated only by the power of god, or (2)a man with an encyclopedic mind that remembers small details of solomon spaulding\u2019s manuscript, niehbur\u2019s maps, etc. even if we assume that joseph never saw niehbur\u2019s map but simply heard about it, it seems to me that we must say that joseph had a photographic memory to remember all these details, yet miss important facts such as jesus born at jerusalem.\nwhile I am comfortable believing that joseph was no dummy, I am not comfortable believing he had a photographic memory either. it seems to me that if joseph did remember nhm, he must lean toward photographic memory. yet I see real problems with that line of reasoning as well.\nThere may come a day when the ramblings of some 1990s teenager about life in outer space may appear fantastically prevenient \u2013 to future readers who have little understanding of popular culture of an earlier era. That which to us is esoteric data was often common to people of earlier times. And perhaps most importantly, if the burden of discovering all these things devolves upon us, it was never the burden of Joseph Smith. Whatever he saw and liked may have entered his writings. The Arabian place names that never struck him as interesting would not make it into the Book of Mormon.\nI still think it\u2019s more likely that Joseph might have used a variant on the Old Testament name \u201cNahum\u201d (\u201ccomforter\u201d) to describe the place where Ishmael died, and his family sought comfort in their mourning, than that Joseph saw \u201cNehm\u201d on an old map.\nThe point is that there are plausible naturalistic explanations (we\u2019ve covered at least two here) for the coincidence of \u201cNHM\u201d and \u201cNahom.\u201d It\u2019s just not the slam-dunk evidence it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nbut thomas, then it makes joseph smith as a genius like dan brown of da vinci code fame. dan compiled all this religious information into a book, but it took him years to put his book together. joseph smith is doing the same thing in a few months, and doesn\u2019t seem to have the benefits of google like brown does. is it really that plausible that joseph got it all right with egyptian names pahoran and paanchi, while figuring out nhm too? at the same time he makes anachronisms with horses, chariots, and silk. this genius title seems to have some big problems, all while joseph is writing a book of theology.\nMany people conclude that, since we haven\u2019t found it all, Joseph Smith could not have found it either, except through revelation. They emphasize Joseph as an educationally-deprived lad chosen to restore the gospel. They add that no one, in fact, could have found the words and power of Mormonism without the help of God. Such a conclusion is convincing to the convinced \u2013 fully relevant, satisfying and final \u2013 IF one presumes the final product before the fact: supposing, in advance of the process, no possible \u201ccorrect\u201d development but Mormonism as it finally turned out, as we have known it in its various stages, complete with only the \u201cMormon\u201d elements discerned or blended successfully out of a vast and confusing world.\nIf this sounds just right, it is a dangerous back-door defense that falls apart the moment one sees we are dealing with a farm boy whom the twentieth century never knew. Not a genius, but one derived from a culture that was surprisingly rich, varied and available. There was so much there from which to choose, and indeed, as you note (#50), Joseph did not necessarily get it all right.\nMy last semester at BYU, I took a Shakespeare class for the fun of it. The class consisted of 3 guys and something like 17 women. This being the BYU English department, these women had what passes in Provo for a feminist streak. I was amazed to learn just how many modern feminist themes Will Shakespeare had salted away in his plays.\nThe point is that people who go looking for useful parallels in a text, will usually find them.\nCoincidences are more statistically likely than people might expect; in fact, the more proper names you collect, the more likely there will be a remarkable coincidence between one of them and an utterly unconnected one. Like Onidah/Oneida, for instance, if you want to think Joseph didn\u2019t get the former from the latter. If a culture or a history or a landscape is described broadly enough, there\u2019s plenty of room for people to come in afterwards and identify specific details that fit within the broad scope of the writing.\nAnd no, Joseph wouldn\u2019t have to be a \u201cgenius\u201d to use \u201cNahom/Nahum\u201d for a place of mourning. Mildly clever, at most.\nIgnores the fact that the Book of Mormon project was in progress for three whole years, if you count the project start date back when he started work with Martin Harris. The famous \u201cthree months\u201d consists of the final draft produced with Oliver Cowdery.\nAs a comparison. I once wrote the World\u2019s Greatest Revolutionary War screenplay. The project dribbled on in outline form, coming together in my mind and partly on paper, over a period of three years \u2014 and then I finally buckled down and wrote out the last 4/5 in the course of two months, while simultaneously working a regular job. I suspect that a person reading it will find some parallels, and also some disparities, between what I wrote, and the history and geography of the Hudson River Valley setting (which I\u2019ve never visited, and did precious little research on). If there are parallels, it won\u2019t mean I was inspired.\nWhen Harold Bloom calls Joseph Smith an \u201cauthentic religious genius\u201d, he ascribes to Joseph an almost incomprehensible ability to craft religious history and theology in ways that others cannot. A genius of any kind has a mind that operates in ways that normal people cannot fathom. That is why we call them geniuses. If JS was indeed such a genius, to compare JS to Dan Brown is silly. Not all authors practice their craft in the same way, and almost certainly JS didn\u2019t research and write the book of mormon the way that we might suppose a historical novelist would write a story.\nI believe that JS was a religious genius in the same category as Muhammad, Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Jesus, or maybe even someone like Paramahansa Yogananda. These individuals were able to draw upon existing spiritual traditions around them and produce something new and compelling, and which spoke truth to the souls of those who listened to them or read their words. Whether what any of these spiritual geniuses said is, in fact, \u201ctruth\u201d cannot be ultimately verified theologically (you cannot prove or disprove God\u2019s existence, for example). In terms of relating historical or scientifically-verifiable facts, all religious genius will fall short because doing so isn\u2019t really the point: these are not individuals who apply the scientific method or modern historical research methodologies to their messages. If we take Jesus\u2019 word, for example, that the mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds, then we have to reclassify all the many thousands (millions?) of other plant seeds that are, in fact, smaller than a mustard seed, or else make Jesus either a liar or an ignoramus. In the end, if you get caught up on whether the seed is in fact the smallest, or whether Jesus really did in fact use a mustard seed as an object lesson (or if someone else writing the story down many decades after which supposed lesson was purported to have taken place just put words in Jesus\u2019 mouth), you miss the message which might actually convey some truth or wisdom that could be beneficial to you in your life: that having just a little bit of faith gets you far in God\u2019s kingdom.\nI\u2019m in the camp that can\u2019t really accept NHM as \u201cproof\u201d of Lehi\u2019s existence any more than Joseph Smith\u2019s public denials of polygamy were \u201cproof\u201d that he never entered its practice. Fact is, there are tons of references to names, places, and things in the Book of Mormon that one would expect to be easily corroborated by hundreds of years of collecting artifactual evidence in the Americas, but that are simply not there. Meanwhile, there\u2019s plenty of 19th-century American-Protestant-influenced religious theology packed into the Book of Mormon, forcing the reader who believes in the book\u2019s historicity to accept that ancient peoples 2,600 years ago had advanced understanding of Christian theology and doctrine, even though there exists no evidences of such understanding among any of the world\u2019s contemporary inhabitants of the ancient world, even among the records we have that come from the Jews. Joseph either took extreme liberties with the text of the golden plates, or made huge theological mistakes in his \u201ctranslation\u201d of them, or else made the whole thing up (possibly with the help of friends and associates). That the Book of Mormon is as cohesive a narrative as it is testifies not to its historical truth, imo, as the religious genius of its creator.\nStill, getting caught up in questions of historicity and authenticity really dillutes the power of some of the words written in the Book of Mormon. Just as the Bible contains lots of stories and writings that get largely skipped over because they no longer represent the theological sensibilities of the modern reader, we _can_ pick and choose which portions of the Book of Mormon speak \u201ctruth\u201d to our modern souls without getting caught up in the angst of a black-or-white, all-or-nothing dichotomy. I used to think that religion had to be all true or all suspect, but now I\u2019m just happy when I find messages that ring \u201ctrue\u201d to me, and feel grateful that they actually speak to me among all the other stuff that is out there. That\u2019s a net positive, imo.\nHere, here, SteveS (#53). My personal favorite passage in the Book of Mormon is found in modern 2 Nephi 2:25, \u201cAdam fell, that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\u201d When asked to write a completely middle-of-the-road introduction to Octavo Corporation\u2019s digitized version of the 1830 Book of Mormon in the 1990s, one of my paragraphs went like this . . .\nThere were works of equally imposing claim, of course, even in nineteenth-century America, and it would be unproductive to insist that this book is entirely unique. Indeed, much of the Book of Mormon speaks not merely from its own era, but indeed from its own decade and the very counties from which it emerged. This I have verified over the years in hundreds of texts examined and transcribed from the immediate world and culture of Joseph Smith. So when I point out that the Book of Mormon also has its exceptional moments, readers of all persuasions may allow that surprises wait between its leaves.\nBut to me, coming from a physics background, that is the most interesting part of the Book of Mormon historicity question. I agree with BTC that the belief has to come first before one bothers to ask whether the historicity is worth pursuing (JMB can probably write a Bayesian about how different priors make historicity tests valuable or not!).\nBut once I have the belief in the Book of Mormon as a motivator, I immediately see, just as BTC does, that you can\u2019t \u201cdomesticate\u201d it into a theory of scripture like modern scientific believers have adopted for the Bible. There\u2019s then no separation between the natural and the supernatural that permits the notion of non-overlapping magisteria. The supernatural must be accepted by a believer, or (my preference) the notion of the natural must be expanded so the activity of God in history is in-your-face.\nThat question is even more important, IMO, than trying to extract individual messages from the scriptures themselves. You make more progress when you can unify theories than when you are dealing with each idea separately. And the differences between revelation (or religious genius) as seen in the BofM and the Bible provide a really good arena for testing more general theories of scripture.\nI like your ideas of the pervasiveness of notions in a society as the raw materials for religious genius. But there\u2019s a trap; it\u2019s easier to see the sources of a prophet\u2019s inspiration after the fact. All the materials were present for Einstein to think of relativity well before he did so. There are thousands of people today who understand relativity better than Einstein ever did. But few of those thousands could make the inspirational leap themselves.\n\u201cWhether the virtues of parallels outweigh the vices is open to debate. The fact remains that the vices are considerable.\n1. Any method of comparison which lists and underscores similarities and suppresses or minimizes differences is necessarily misleading.\n2. Parallels are too readily susceptible of manipulation. Superficial resemblances may be made to appear as of the essence.\n3. Parallel-hunters do not, as a rule, set out to be truthful and impartial. They are hell-bent on proving a point.\n4. Parallel-hunting is predicated on the use of lowest common denominators. Virtually all literature, even the most original, can be reduced to such terms, and thereby shown to be unoriginal. So viewed, Mark Twain\u2019s The Prince and the Pauper plagiarizes Dickens\u2019 David Copperfield. Both deal with England, both describe the slums of London, both see their hero exalted beyond his original station. To regard any two books in this light, however, is to ignore every factor that differentiates one man\u2019s thoughts, reactions and literary expression from another\u2019s.\n5. Parallel columns operate piecemeal. They wrench phrases and passages out of context. A product of the imagination is indivisible. It depends on totality of effect. To remove details from their setting is to falsify them.\n6. Parallels fail to indicate the proportion which the purportedly borrowed material bears to the sum total of the source, or to the whole of the new work. Without such information a just appraisal is impossible.\n7. The practitioners of the technique resort too often to sleight of hand. They employ language, not to record facts or to describe things accurately, but as props in a rhetorical hocus-pocus which, by describing different things in identical words, appears to make them magically alike.\n8. A double-column analysis is a dissection. An autopsy will reveal a great deal about a cadaver, but very little about the spirit of the man who once inhabited it.\n9. Most parallels rest on the assumption that if two successive things are similar, the second one was copied from the first. This assumption disregards all the other possible causes of similarity.\nThis isn\u2019t to say, of course, that LDS apologists haven\u2019t engaged in their fair share of the abuse of parallels \u2013 but, your mammoth work is not the kind of evidence that you put it forward to be. Parallels themselves are relatively meaningless. They don\u2019t tell us much at all. It is the differences that allow for meaningful and interesting discussion. While some of your parallels are certainly of interest and worth considering, the compilation as a whole is fatally flawed.\nI have been absent for quite some time. Thanks for the welcome back!\nI really don\u2019t have much to add to the discussion as others have covered what I would have posted even better than I in relation to NHM.\nI was told about Nahom while attending a leadership meeting in Japan by Neal H. Maxwell in 1995. He was very excited about the discovery and painted a picture of this place being just recently found and therefore impossible for JS to have known about it. That seemed like a bulls-eye to me as well back then. Imagine my shock in finding out just how long the area has been known and who had written about it and mapped it.\nThe fact that it was known and written about now makes the argument shift from what he couldn\u2019t have possibly known to what he probably didn\u2019t know as a poor farmer in upstate New York. Even you must admit that\u2019s a much weaker piece of evidence then if NHM had been discovered after the BoM was published.\nFireTag: The dilemma you mention applies more to an independently-verified or very widely-accepted theory or system. If we accept Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, then it may seem like genius to have ferreted it out from all the data in the Universe. But if we think like this about Mormonism, then we are essentially only saying that Mormonism is true because it is true. If we begin with the assumption that Mormonism (at whatever time period we wish to set it, for consideration) is true, then of course Joseph Smith\u2019s task \u2013 apart from being inspired \u2013 would seem impossible. But Mormonism could have turned out to be almost anything else, as well. As I said in an earlier comment, if the burden of discovery of Joseph\u2019s sources devolves upon us, that burden was never Joseph Smith\u2019s.\nBen McGuire: Your accusations are not really against me, but against some generic description you have espoused. I have more integrity and historical capability than you suggest. My book is a reference work, designed to supply raw data for researchers who need it. The work will stand, and I invite other readers to dig more deeply, and tear into my individual entries, comparing them carefully with similar sources, and exploring the portions I quoted very carefully to see if I twisted any contexts or authors\u2019 original intents.\nChuckle. Of all the time I am sure Ben McGuire spent reading that mammoth volume, I am surprised he (apparently) missed/forgot the title of the book, which very clearly states that it is \u201cA Bibliographic Source.\u201d I for one find the resource to be priceless, and look forward to using it in future projects to come.\nThis may come as a bit of a shock to you, but in the end I actually hope your right about the BoM and the bible.\nI was assuming the starting point of belief in the supernatural (or, in my case, I should say, that nature is dominated at large scales by its personal rather than its impersonal aspects \u2014 I think God IS all of reality rather than separate from reality).\nThe modern scientist, whether physical or social scientist, is trained to the notion that \u201cnatural\u201d is the default position. It takes a conceptual leap to change to a notion of seeing the physical and spiritual as a unified whole, or perhaps a conceptual regression to get back to the notion that the spiritual is the important part of reality, even though we are one of the few cultures in history to hold the \u201cmodern\u201d view. We don\u2019t look for such a leap unless motivated by something \u2014 a religious teaching, a personal experience, or something else. So it takes prophetic genius to make the leap.\nIt was in this context that I mentioned Einstein. The genius lies in REJECTING the notion of your everyday senses that space and time are a fixed stage and learning to see spacetime as an evolving character in the story itself. It wasn\u2019t verified (or experimentally verifiable) for years afterward, and physicists only began training themselves to conceive of spacetime that way AFTER the verification. Now its obvious that even a bar magnet is a relativistic effect of electricity.\nOnce motivated, exploring \u201canamalies\u201d that stand the paradoxes of our belief systems out in the open are the way physical scientists make progress in looking for the right conceptual link \u2014 the right \u201ccrazy ideas\u201d.\nIn the Mormon faith, the Bible and the Book of Mormon present a huge anomaly because they each present an incompatible theory of scriptural transmission. There\u2019s an analog in physics for that, too. The twin pillars of modern physics are quantum mechanics and general relativity. They are fundamentally incompatable on a conceptual basis because QM can\u2019t be framed yet on anything but the \u201cspace and time as a fixed stage\u201d basis, and unifying them is the biggest prize on the horizon.\nWell, I think there\u2019s an underlying assumption here. You\u2019re using the term \u201cspiritual\u201d as it relates to supernatural phenomena CAUSED externally by some force. One can easily view the physical and spiritual as a unified whole and still accept \u201cspiritual\u201d as being what benefits an individual \u201cspiritually.\u201d That is, one need not postulate external mystical CAUSAL relationships to explain spirituality. Nor does this, in my mind, invalidate the spiritual experience. Rather, it is a more honest acknowledgement of the experience. Of course, this distinction leads one nicely to a post-modern view which many find dissatisfying.\nI\u2019m merely saying that the modern scientist is trained to reject the view described in the quote. The possibility you describe is CERTAINLY one way of relating the physical to the spiritual. The attraction of such views to the modern is that the \u201cspiritual\u201d is CONTAINED or ISOLATED to the metaphorical or the psychological and potentially subsumable to the modern worldview as our understanding of the arts, the social sciences, or the physical sciences grow. It keeps God in the gaps. It requires no conceptual leap.\nOur reality may work that way. The universe may be non-relativistic, too; I am aware of at least two theories that attempt to merge relativity and quantum mechanics by making relativity go away at extremely small length scales. Maybe Einstein\u2019s conceptual leap turns out to be, at best a useful approximation. But we test those fundamental assumptions anyway, because that\u2019s how we learn.\nWhat I am suggesting is that we need to look for new solutions to the problem of unifying the spiritual and physical that do NOT contain the spiritual within the physical any more than they contain the physical within the spiritual.\nAt the moment I am sitting in my office looking at the cover of a book on my bookshelf, titled \u201cThe Gold of Exodus\u201d. It was given to me by an investigator on my mission, so settled down an knocked it on a P-Day. It was about two men, Larry Williams (yes the world famous, yet superstitious investor/advisor, and apparent grave robber) and Bob Cornuke, founder of B.A.S.E. (Biblical Arcaeology & Search Exploration). These two men apparently set on a quest to discover the \u201ctrue\u201d Mount Sinai sometime either in the 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s, and ended up hiking to the summit of Jabal-al-lawz in Saudia Arabia. Apparently the traditional site for the location is somewhere in Ethiopia.\nI would tend to agree that the prevailing sentiment, no doubt influenced by the subtle endorsements via Church media, is the Central American theory. This seems to be the position most widely accepted by those of the F.A.I.R. crowd, but there has been a vehement disagreement between this group and those associated with the theories of a former meat salesman by the name of Rod Meldrum. The evidences sited both groups are so quickly dismissed by the others, that it clearly demonstrates that the evidence is far, far, from conclusive for even those who ultimately share the same position. The same goes for the Bible. Yes, it may have a stronger foothold in antiquity, but it is one thing to say Sodom may have reference to some ancient city, and completely another to say that Lot\u2019s wife was turned into a pillar of salt as they fled.\nThey main problem with all of this inquiry, is that evidence is fitted to the conclusion. This is true of both Bible and BoM scholars. In order to justify scientifically the parting of the Red Sea, we have theories that suggest that the Israelites had a much greater lead on the Egyptians, and passed through a wadi during conveniently timed moon-tides. Some have suggested that Soddom and Gomorrah lay beneath the Salt Sea, suggesting a metaphor for the whole salt business. At the end of the day however, the evidence of the wadi\u2019s, or the salt content of Old World locations, do not independently lead to conclusions about the stories we teach. Just like NHM \u2013 depending on liberal we want to be on proximities, we can eventually find a beach that satisfies expectations of a percieved Bountiful.\nIt\u2019s not as if Mormon handed down some book or oral tradition to his progenitors who perhaps wrote it down or rewrote it, changed, and/or modified it eventually falling into the hands of JS> \u2014 the whole point of my deconstructing the Book of Mormon posts and a number of other analytical approaches to the text involve the fact that Mormon did indeed take various traditions, writings and such and edit/collect/summarize them into a book that he passed on to Joseph Smith, through Mormon\u2019s son Moroni.\nBen McGuire \u2014 interesting thoughts, thanks for sharing them.\nMH \u2014 look forward to your posts.\nSome interesting posts here, enjoyed reading the comments.\ncowboy, I think we are talking about the same mountain. jebel al-lawz sounds familiar to me. I know that jebel musa literally translates to \u2018mount of moses.\u2019 simcha jacobovici put together a documentary on the exodus and he has a location in israel for mount sinai in a restricted military zone. he got into a battle on a blog I read as to why his mount sinai was a better site than the saudi site. it was interesting to view the debate and reminded me of the meldrum-sorensen debates. I think few mormons delve into these biblical debates, but I think there are some really similar debates to book of mormon archaeology debates.",

    "text": "All of these Codes are available for purchase at the Customer Service Counter in the Business Development and Permit Center, 3300 Central Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45225. Call 513-352-3271.\nFor assistance while using these Codes, call the number listed with the Code titles.\nThis code has been adopted by the City of Cincinnati for one-, two- and three- family dwellings including their accessory structures and up to three attached townhouses less than four stories in height.\nIt skips the many provisions that apply to non-residential buildings, making it easy to read. The chapters are arranged in a logical construction sequence, starting with the building planning. Along with the usual building restrictions, it contains the applicable parts of the Mechanical Code.\nThis code applies to construction and/or alterations of non-residential buildings and residences not governed by the Residential Code of Ohio.\nThis code applies to all commercial heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, incineration, air pollution control and similar work not governed by the Residential Code of Ohio.\nThis code applies to all plumbing work.\nCall with questions about electrical work.\nThis Code is a collection of 19 local regulations, laws and ordinances that supplements the Residential Code of Ohio, the Ohio Building Code, the Ohio Mechanical Code and the Ohio Plumbing Code.\nIt also includes local regulations regarding construction in the flood plain (Chapter 1109) and excavation and fill requirements (Chapter 1113).\nChapter 1115 adopts the RCO One-, Two-, and Three Family Dwelling Code.\nChapter 1117 (Housing Code) regulates all existing residential buildings.\nChapter 1107 provides local enforcement of the ASME Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators and related regulations.\nChapter 1121 provides Historic Rehabilitation Standards.\nThis Code section relates to the use and maintenance of existing residential buildings, portions thereof or premises used or intended to be used for human habitation. All provisions of the Housing Code are retroactive and apply to all existing dwellings.\nThe purpose of this Code section is to establish minimum housing standards necessary for the preservation of the public safety, health and general welfare in all existing residential buildings, rooming houses, hotels and motels, except to the extent that it may be in conflict with the laws of this State or with the lawful regulations of any State Board Agency.\nThis standard applies to historically designated buildings containing residential business and retail uses that are five stories in height or less, 4,000 square feet in area, of Type IIIB construction, or better, with each floor having two means of egress. This standard allows most sound existing walls and ceilings to remain in lieu of upgrading the fire resistive ratings to new Code Standards. This is especially applicable to changes of use and occupancy situations.\nThe Cincinnati Zoning Code regulates the use and development of land and is designed to protect property values by preventing the location of incompatible uses in close proximity to one another. Zoning regulations also help to maintain the character of established neighborhoods and prevent inappropriate activities such as auto repair in residential neighborhoods.\nThe Zoning Code governs land use in historic districts, hillsides and certain urban business areas. It regulates development to avoid parking congestion and promotes effective signage compatible with its surroundings. This Code is generally arranged in a sequence of more restrictive Zoning districts to less restrictive Zoning districts.\nExample No. 1: John Q. and Susan J. Public purchase a three-story building in Over-the-Rhine. The last use of this building was business on the first floor and storage in the basement and the upper floors.\nThey wish to turn the building into a 12-unit building (four units on each floor) with a Laundromat and storage in the basement.\nBecause this work will involve a change of use, many sections of the OBC will apply, as well as applicable provisions of the Housing Code. Note: OBC Chapter 34 has alternative compliance provisions for building constructed prior to July 1, 1979. If the building is designated historic, then CBC Chapter 1121 would apply thereby mitigating the fire resistance upgrades required by the OBC.\nExample No. 2: Mr. Smith wishes to convert his three-story, two-family on Liberty Hill into condominiums. He wishes to make them more desirable by adding a room and deck to each floor to better market the view of the city. He must comply with the RCO Code as well as the Housing Code since he has only two dwelling units.\nExample No. 3: Ms. Jones owns a four-story, two-family building in the West End. She wishes to renovate the building and turn it into a four-family. Because of the number of units and floors, the provisions of the OBC and pertinent sections of the Housing Code must be met. If the building is designated historic, then CBC Chapter 1121 would apply thereby mitigating the fire resistance upgrades required by the OBC.\nExample No. 4: An organization wants to renovate a problem, vacant four-story, 12-unit apartment building. As part of the renovation, a number of units would be converted into efficiency units and a number of units combined into three- and four-bedroom units.\nThe OBC would govern any new construction such as unit separation walls, which are typically required to be rated for one-hour fire resistance. Any new room arrangements are required to comply with new code standards with respect to size, access and privacy and light and ventilation. Even though no changes are anticipated outside of the units, the exits and fire rating of the common stair hall need to comply with the Housing Code.\nOther typical existing conditions that need to be evaluated for compliance with the Housing Code and shown on the construction plans are the existing room sizes, natural light and ventilation for existing habitable rooms, access to toilet rooms and requirements for habitable rooms below grade.\nOther areas that need to be addressed are indicated on any orders that have been written on the building.\nIf the building is designated historic, then CBC Chapter 1121 would apply thereby mitigating the fire resistance upgrades required by the OBC.\nThe State of Ohio has adopted the 2013 version of the Residential Code of Ohio (RCO). Consequently, some of the City\u2019s handouts and brochures are in the process of being updated by City staff. Please call 513 352-3313 if you have questions or need clarifications about any handout at our website.\nThe Permit Application forms are created as PDFs that are optimized for printing directly from your browser.\nEach permit application can be printed and faxed or hand-delivered to 3300 Central Pkwy., Cincinnati, Ohio, 45225. After inserting your specific information on the application and printing it, fax or hand-deliver the application to the appropriate location. If you need assistance completing the applications, contact 513-352-3271.\nThese fees are not applicable to all plumbing and HVAC Repair/Replace Application not requiring plans.\nA special Walk-Through service is available for reviewing applications for Building Permits related to small- and medium-sized tenant improvements, including signs, awnings, tents, fences and roofing work, and residential alterations and additions including decks, retaining walls, fences and roofing work.\nProjects are reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis.\nThe cost for this service is $79 (1,2,3 family) and $441 (multi-family/commercial). These fees are in addition to the regular permit fees.\nBusinesses in the State of Ohio typically must register with the Federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and with the Ohio Department of Taxation. Many businesses must register as a legal entity with the State of Ohio. In addition, employers must follow the requirements of the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation and Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Lastly, there are State of Ohio licensing/permitting requirements specific to certain types of businesses. More information about all of the above can be found at: http://business.ohio.gov/.\nBusinesses must apply to the Hamilton County Auditor for a Vendors License, which authorizes a business to make taxable sales and collect sales tax. More information can be found at: http://www.hamiltoncountyauditor.org/vendors.asp.\nThe following are the most common business types that require additional licensing from the City of Cincinnati; however please note that this list may not be comprehensive.\nNew construction or substantial alteration of existing building.\nPermit required for any building alterations; restaurant operations must also comply with Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) regulations.\nRegistration required for contractors (construction, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.).",

    "text": "This guide does not claim to be complete. It reflects my view on how to setup a working Arch Linux system tailored towards data science, R and spatial analysis. If you have suggestions for modifications, please open an issue. Enjoy the power of Linux!\nSetting up Arch Linux the old-school way (i.e. configuring all yourself) is quite tedious. To be honest, I\u2019ve never done it myself. I\u2019ve always used distributions like Antergos or Manjaro. These function on the one hand as an installation wrapper for Arch and on the other hand provide their own repositories. Both come with all kind of desktop environments to choose from (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.). I will not go into details of desktop environments in this post. I will outline my personal setup in a separate post in the future.\nMake sure to check out the ArchWiki FAQs and Arch compared to other distributions - ArchWiki to get a better understanding of Arch.\nCurrently the best wrapper around pacman is trizen. Here is a list (AUR helpers - ArchWiki) comparing alternatives (scroll to the bottom).\nIn ~/.config/trizen/trizen.conf set no_edit => 1. Until v1.55 there was also a switch that saved you the prompt asking whether you really want to install the package (install_built_with_noconfirm => 1). Unfortunately it has been removed in v1.56 and now you need to pass --noconfirm to trizen commands. The first settings saves you the confirmation prompt asking whether you want to edit a PKGBUILD (i.e. the scripts that specify how to download and install a package).\nAll Linux system come with bash (Bourne-again shell) as default. While this shell is not bad, there are better alternatives. You have to decide whether investing the time to change the shell and learn the new syntax will make a difference for you. Since you will (hopefully) use the terminal quite often (from now on), I would recommend to at least try it :) My current favorite is the fish shell.\nThe zsh (Z-shell) is highly customizable but its settings are a bit complicated. It has several advantages (file globbing, visual appearance, etc.) to bash.\nA good zsh helper is prezto: GitHub - sorin-ionescu/prezto: The configuration framework for Zsh). Install (trizen zsh) and use it (zsh). My favorite theme is agnoster.\nThe fish shell is similar to zsh but comes with better defaults and an easier syntax. The omf package manager is great for installing additional plugins that simplify the shell usage. Check Oh-my-fish for an introduction.\nThe shell is available in the standard repos and can be installed with trizen fish.\nA great way to get started is to call fish_config in a fish session to configure fish to your needs in a graphical browser window.\nMy current theme is bobthefish.\nCompiling packages from source can take time. To speed up the process by enabling parallel compiling, set the MAKEVARS variable in /etc/makepkg.conf: MAKEFLAGS=\"-j$(nproc)\". This will use all available cores on your machine for compiling.\nA note before the installation process: If you only have 8 GB of RAM, you need to temporary increase the size of your /tmp folder. Otherwise the tmp folder will run out of space due to all the package downloads and installations and you will face weird error messages if you do all the installations without a reboot. Increasing the /tmp folder temporarily can be done by sudo mount -o remount,size=20G,noatime /tmp. This increases the size for your current session to 20 GB. Usually the size is about half or your RAM size. The size will be resetted when you restart your machine next time.\nA note of caution: Try to avoid installing python libraries via pip. If you install libraries via pacman that have python dependencies, pacman will try to install the respective python-<package>. If you installed this package via pip before, you will face conflicts. First search if the package is available in the repos and if not, you can safely install it via pip.\nWhile already at python packages, QGIS needs some external python libraries for its plugins. Otherwise it will throw errors during startup.\nHere is a list of applications I use. Choose for yourself which could be helpful for your.\nGoogle Drive: I use the paid service insync.\nI use Notion which atm has not Linux Desktop app and can be used in the browser only.\nA note on Mailspring: If you are on battery, quit the app as it consume a lot of energy while steadily trying to sync your mails.\nEditors are an important topic so I devote an extra section to them. You can use editors to only edit text files but they can also be used as an IDE for coding. There are many editors out there, all loved by a certain group of people.\nHere\u2019s a list of the most popular ones (this list does not claim to be complete). Also some of the listed apps are actually IDEs while some are only text editors.\nI currently use Neovim which is a fork of vim for quick editing on the command line. My general purpose IDE is Visual Studio Code and for R development I use RStudio.\nIf you are on a KDE Desktop, LibreOffice may flicker black/white. This is caused by OpenGl.\nAdditionally, I recommend to install the Papirus Icon theme for Libreoffice: trizen -S --noconfirm papirus-libreoffice-theme.\nThis library caches all C compiled code, making reoccuring package installations that use C code a lot faster.\nAdditionally, install ccache on your system: trizen ccache. See this blog post by Dirk Eddelbuettel as a reference.\nTo use R from the shell without a prior defined mirror, you need the system libraries tcl and tk to launch the mirror selection popup (trizen -S tcl tk).\nNext, install either the \u201cIntel MKL\u201d or libopenblas to be used in favor of the standard \u201clibRlapack/libRblas\u201d libraries that are shipped with the default R installation. These libraries are responsible for numerical computations and have impressive speedups compared to the default libraries. Thanks [@marcosci](https://github.com/marcosci) for the hint. While the \u201cIntel MKL\u201d library is the fasted according to the benchmarks, its also much more complicated to install.\nlibopenblas will automatically be used if its installed since the default R installation on Arch is configured with the --with-blas option (see section A.3.1 in https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installation). I recommend installing the AUR package openblas-lapack as its package cominbing multiple libraries: trizen -S --noconfirm openblas-lapack.\nThere is an AUR package that provides R compiled with intel-mkl named r-mkl. Note: The download size of intel-mkl is around 4 GB and takes a lot of memory during installation. Most of it will stored in the swap (around 10 GB) so make sure your SWAP space is > 10 GB.\nAlso to successfully install intel-mkl, you need to temporarly increase the /tmp directory as intel-mkl requires quite some space: sudo mount -o remount,size=30G,noatime /tmp.\nUse trizen -s rstudio and pick your favorite release channel. During installation R will get installed as a dependency (if you have not already done so).\nOpen RStudio and install the R package usethis (it will install quite a few dependencies, get a coffee) and then call usethis::browse_github_pat(). Follow the instructions to set up a valid GITHUB_PAT environment variable that will be used for installing packages from Github.\nOf course you it is not required to install all packages of a task view. You will never use all packages of a task view. In my opinion, however, it is pretty neat to have one command that installs (almost) all packages I use of a certain field. I do not care about the additional packages installed.\nFor rJava we need to do sudo R CMD javareconf.\nNow you can install the ctv package and then call ctv::install.views(\"Spatial\"). This will install all packages listed in the spatial task view.\nThe easiest way (in my opinion) is to use SSH and usethis::create_from_github().\nIf you have never set a \u201cssh keygen pair\u201d at your local machine, please do so by calling ssh-keygen -t rsa.\nIf you already have a file named id_rsa.pub in your ~/.ssh folder at your local machine, skip this step! Otherwise it will override your existing one and may invalidate previous ssh connections you set up. You now have an id_rsa.pub file in a (hidden!) folder named .ssh within /home (at your local machine). (You can enable viewing hidden files/folders in the file-manager with the shortcut ALT + . (Dolphin) or CTRL + h (Nautilus)).\nThe local directory in which you want to store your Github repos should have 777 permissions. This usually is not the case if you create the directory. If the permissions are wrong, usethis::create_from_github() will not be able to write files there. sudo chmod 777 ~/git.\nThis object is then passed to the credentials argument in create_from_github().\nyou can also use create_from_github(repo = \"pat-s/oddsratio\", destdir = \"~/git\", credentials = git2r::cred_ssh_key()).\nThe little overhead is really worth it: You have a working ssh setup and by reusing the command and just replacing the repo name the cloning off all your repos is done within minutes!\nWhile most people use R from within RStudio, it is important to have a proper command line setup. I often call R in a second session (besides RStudio) to update packages, run R CMD check on a package, etc. The native R command line that you get when typing R in your shell lacks a lot of features. Fortunately, there is radian. Its advantages are listed in the README of the repo.\nI\u2019ve set an alias that maps r to radian. So whenever I type r into the console and hit enter, I get a \u201c21st century ready\u201d R console.\nThe ~/.Rprofile holds several options that will be applied during R startup. However, specifying all custom functions, options and other calls in one R file can get messy. Fortunately, there is the startup package. You can put several .R files into the ~/.Rprofile.d directory. This way you can organize your custom R startup better. Also, by running startup::startup(debug = TRUE) you can actually see what happens if you start R.\nYou can find my settings in my Dropbox.\nThere are multiple approaches how to achieve this (Auto-mount network shares (cifs, sshfs, nfs) on-demand using autofs | Patrick Schratz, fstab - ArchWiki).\nHere is an example of a fstab setup for a sshfs (to Linux server) and cifs (to Windows server) mount. Append those lines to /etc/fstab; don\u2019t overwrite the existing content as this will result in boot errors otherwise!\n(cifs) Depending how new the Windows server is, you do not need vers=1.0.\n(cifs) Store your login credentials for the windows server in a file, e.g. /etc/.smbcredentials.txt with contents being username = <username> and password = <password>.\n(sshfs) Copy .ssh/id_rsa to root/.ssh/ as the mount will be executed by the root user.\nBoth advantage and disadvantage of using fstab are that it tries to mount the directories during boot. However, often this fails. Either because of a missing network connection at this point or because you need a VPN to access a server remotely.\nI won\u2019t go into details of all options I used here. Check out the manual pages of the respective protocols if you are facing errors.\nIf you use fstab, you can mount all mounts with sudo mount -a.\nThe manual approach needs to be saved in a bash script and called from your shell with bash <filename>.sh.\nsudo pkill -kill -f \"sshfs\"\nSome operations in this file may be redundant or ineffective.\nMount all mounts specified in <name of mount file>.sh.\nAgain we use ssh, this time to log into remote servers rather than downloading Github repos. If you have never set a \u201cssh keygen pair\u201d at your local machine, please do so by calling ssh-keygen -t rsa.\nEvery time you log in via command line now, you will not be prompted for your password.\nYou can easily connect to all servers you have access to with a little one-time effort.\ntmux is a terminal multiplexer that lets you create complex terminal arrangements. Additionally, you can use keybindings to quickly move between panes and a lot of extensions exists to save and restore layouts.\nOne extension, namely tmuxinator gives you the power to write template files for server connections. This makes it possible to load several server connections with just one command.\nKDE is probably the DE (Desktop environment) that is most customizable. By default it comes with a Windows-like navigation panel. However, you can have a dock by using latte-dock. I used KDE for quite some time and I was satisfied with most of it.\nIf you want to use an automatic login to a VPN and the networkmanager-daemon (e.g. Openconnect) does not store your password, try the network-manager-applet package. It is the GNOME network-manager and has (for whatever reason) no problems with storing the password.\nGNOME looks more like macOS. Clean, fresh, smooth. However, it needs a bit more love in my opinion to get a proper working setup. You need to find which gnome-extensions you need for your work. Most of them are present in the AUR.\nAlso (and this is the biggest downside) it consumes a lot of memory. I ditched it in the end because of this. On my 16 GB machine, I could hardly have all my standard apps open with now hitting my RAM limit. In contrast, on my current Desktop Environment (i3) I really cross the 8 GB mark.\ntrizen -Q | grep \"gnome-shell\"\nYou can control the settings via the \u201cTweak tool\u201d that comes with GNOME by default.\nNote that GNOME comes with Wayland as the desktop compositor library while KDE still uses X. I am not an expert in both but the future is said to be Wayland. You might run into some troubles with driver support for Wayland and there is much better documentation and help for X. You can also run GNOME with X if you are facing too many issues.\nAlthough the Linux kernel has a lot of power saving options, they are not all enabled by default.\nI prefer tlp as powertop often causes trouble with USB devices going into sleep mode. Also, applying the changes on boot is easier with tlp.\nDo trizen -S --noconfirm tlp and then follow the instructions on TLP - ArchWiki to configure it correctly. powertop though is useful to check the applied settings. Do sudo powertop and go to the \u201ctunables\u201d section and check if most settings are \u201cGOOD\u201d (most are \u201cBAD\u201d before applying tlp).\nA machine can crash any time. It is not only important to backup your data and scripts (or to have them stored in the cloud). You also want to backup all configurations of your apps so that you can restore them easily with a click. This is also important and useful if you want to sync all your configurations across multiple machines.\nmackup is a great tool for this. It syncs a variety of config files and uploads these to a cloud of your choice. Under the hood, the config files will get soft-linked to your cloud which means that updating it on one machine will also trigger a change on all other machines.\nOn a new machine, you only need to run mackup restore to have all your settings back. Unfortunately it does not work with Windows but if you are reading this guide, you are most likely not on Windows anymore ;-).\nGitHub - cereda/arara: arara is a TeX automation tool based on rules and directives. An automatization tool for TeX: pac install arara-git. However, lately I use the latex-workshop extention in Visual Studio Code for all my LaTex stuff.\ntrizen -S perl-log-dispatch perl-dbix-log4perl perl-file-homedir perl-unicode-linebreak.\nIt\u2019s also integrad in the latex-workshop extention in Visual Studio Code.\nI use the Dracula scheme in almost all applications. While its comes integrated into RStudio, here are installation instructions for Kate and Tilix. Alternatively I like the tomorrow-night-eighties theme lately.\nI enjoy using Fira Code. I use it as a coding font in all editors (monospace ftw) but also as a system wide font (the \u201cmedium\u201d variant) with size 10. Another great monospace coding font is Iosevka.\nThere are two awesome icon themes: Papirus and numix.\nTry them and choose for yourself. You will see what a tremendous impact good icons can have on your daily work.\nMy overall desktop theme favorite is \u201cAdapta\u201d. Set it via \u201cSystem Settings -> Workspace theme -> Desktop Theme\u201d. For \u201cLook and Feel\u201d I prefer \u201cArc Dark\u201d.\nTo install these, simply click on \u201cGet new looks\u201d on the bottom right when you are in \u201cSystem Settings -> Workspace theme\u201d.\nSet the environment variable QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME to \"qt5ct\" (add set -gx QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME \"qt5ct\" in .config/fish/config.fish).\nRun qt5ct and change the settings to your liking. Note: The default GNOME font is \u201cCantarell Regular 11pt\u201d. To select the default KDE \u201cAdwaita\u201d theme, you need to install it first: trizen -s adwaita-qt5.\nTo create presentations I use the R package xaringan. Usually I convert the resulting HTML slides to PDF using decktape (install with trizen -s nodejs-decktape) and present the talk using impressive (install with trizen -s impressive).\nSome devices need to install the \u201csynaptic touchpad drivers\u201d to enable the a \u201csoft-click\u201d window activation. trizen -s xf86-input-libinput.\npacmanity: Each time you install a package, this tool adds the package to a Github Gist. This Gist stores all of your installed packages. Here\u2019s mine.",

Should an incident arise, it is very important that the medical team know of any illnesses etc. It could (at the worst case scenario) be the difference between life and death.\nBut more importantly, please listen to your body and if you are not feeling well on race day \u2013 Please do seriously consider not running that day, there is always another race when you are feeling better! Thank you.\nAspire Running Events Ltd reserve the right at our discretion to cancel, delay or postpone the event due to unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances including adverse weather conditions, Force Majeure and/or on the advice of Emergency Services. You the participant have read, understood and accept this and where an event has to be cancelled because of this, we shall not be liable for any inconvenience, expenses, costs, losses or damages suffered by participants.\nDue to the ever-growing popularity of the 1k and 50m races which sell out at every event, we have decided to introduce a fair rule policy.\nTherefore, children can enter either the 1k or 50m dash BUT not enter both at the same event.\nWe wish as many little ones as possible to gain a race experience and therefore receive a medal at the end of it and we think the above is fair to all.\nAspire will no longer be offering official \u2018Canicross\u2019 entries for any further events.\nSuitable races will now be renamed \u2018dog friendly\u2019 and will now form part of our inclusive to all policy only.\nWe will no longer be offering separate waves or offer winner trophies at these specifically picked races.\nParticipation of running with your dog is on the understanding that you will have full control at all times and will be courteous and considerate to your fellow runners whether running with a dog or not.\nYou may position yourself wherever you see fit on the start line as you know your dog\u2019s capabilities better than us.\nWe reserve the right to withdraw dog running at any time.\nRefunds \u2013 Can only be given if the participant informs us two months prior to the event entered.\nIf requested before the deadline (2 weeks before race day) your race transfer will continue to be free.\nThe above has sadly had to be implemented due to the overwhelming number of participants who can no longer run so close to race day and therefore request race deferments at the last minute. Each transfer doestake a considerable amount of time.\nName transfers up until 1 week prior to race day will continue to be changed for free. But within the last 1 week prior to race day and until the transfer deadline which will always be 48 hours prior to the event you will be charged \u00a35.\nPlease do remember most organisers in most cases do not offer refunds or transfers and charge ridiculous amounts to change race details. We would never do this but sadly, we are no longer able to absorb these hidden costs without charging\u2026 Apologies in advance.\nPlease note, you can only transfer your race entry once (Should you need to defer again, you will be charged \u00a37.50). If you are unsure if you will be fit, we would rather add you to the unknown transfer list and therefore you can then inform us which race you would like to do when fit and able to do so.\nShould any runner let us know within 48 hours or less before race day (Race day is simply too late) that they can no longer attend their chosen event, they will now be charged a \u00a310 adhoc deferment payment fee when they choose another event they wish to enter.\nAgain, their initial entry fee will have already been absorbed into the original race costs, this includes race numbers, medals, photos and their entry fees.\nTo reiterate we do send on the day entry details 1 week prior to event day and do give specific transfer deadlines.\nThank you for your understanding on the above from your friendly Aspire team.\n4 races for the price of 3 - free race is non-transferable.\nShould any of the pre-registered group booking party be unable to run, sadly their place is un refundable or race transferable. Although we will accept a name transfer.",

    "text": "Purpose: Loss of integrity of either the inner or outer mitochondrial membrane results in the dissipation of the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient that leads to mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (mMPT). This study emphasizes the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3\u03b2) in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, thus preventing mitochondrial depolarization (hereafter termed mitoprotection). Using 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (SB216763), an inhibitor of GSK-3\u03b2, and drawing a distinction between it and 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene (UO126), an inhibitor of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, the means by which GSK-3\u03b2 influences mitoprotection in cultured human lens epithelial (HLE-B3) cells and normal, secondary cultures of bovine lens epithelial cells, maintained in atmospheric oxygen, was investigated.\nMethods: Virally transfected human lens epithelial cells (HLE-B3) and normal cultures of bovine lens epithelial cells were exposed to acute hypoxic conditions (about 1% O2) followed by exposure to atmospheric oxygen (about 21% O2). Specific antisera and western blot analysis was used to examine the state of phosphorylation of ERK and GSK-3\u03b2, as well as the phosphorylation of a downstream substrate of GSK-3\u03b2, glycogen synthase (GS, useful in monitoring GSK-3\u03b2 activity). The potentiometric dye, 1H-benzimidazolium-5,6-dichloro-2-[3-(5,6-dichloro-1,3-diethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-ylidene)-1-propenyl]-1,3-diethyl-iodide (JC-1), was used to monitor mitochondrial depolarization upon exposure of inhibitor treatment relative to the control cells (mock inhibition) in atmospheric oxygen. Caspase-3 activation was scrutinized to determine whether mitochondrial depolarization inevitably leads to apoptosis.\nResults: Treatment of HLE-B3 cells with SB216763 (12 \u00b5M) inactivated GSK-3\u03b2 activity as verified by the enzyme\u2019s inability to phosphorylate its substrate, GS. SB216763-treated cells were not depolarized relative to the control cells as demonstrated with JC-1 fluorescent dye analysis. The HLE-B3 cells treated with UO126, which similarly blocked phosphorylation of GS, were nevertheless prone to mMPT relative to the control cells. Western blot analysis determined that Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) levels were unchanged for SB216763-treated or UO126-treated HLE-B3 cells when compared to their respective control cells. However, unlike the SB216763-treated cells, the UO126-treated cells showed a marked absence of Bcl-2, as well as phosphorylated Bcl-2 relative to the controls. UO126 treatment of bovine lens epithelial cells showed similar results with pBcl-2 levels, while the Bcl-2 content appeared unchanged relative to the control cells. HLE-B3 and normal bovine lens cell cultures showed susceptibility to mMPT associated with the loss of pBcl-2 by UO126 treatment.\nConclusions: Mitochondrial depolarization may occur by one of two key occurrences: interruption of the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane resulting in mMPT or by disruption of the integrity of the inner or outer mitochondrial membrane. The latter scenario is generally tightly regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 activity by SB216763 blocks mMPT by preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. UO126, likewise, inhibits GSK-3\u03b2 activity, but unlike SB216763, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation induces the loss of intracellular pBcl-2 levels under conditions where intracellular BAX levels remain constant. These results suggest that the lenticular mitoprotection normally afforded by the inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2 activity may, however, be bypassed by a loss of pBcl-2, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-2 prevents the translocation of BAX to the mitochondrial outer membrane inhibiting depolarization by disrupting the normal electrochemical gradient leading to mMPT.\nThe dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u03a8) occurs in a process termed mitochondrial permeability transition (mMPT) . Lens epithelial cells represent an ideal model for studying mMPT because the lens thrives in a naturally hypoxic environment, and introducing atmospheric oxygen increases the formation of reactive oxygenated species (ROS), which, in turn, may cause a loss of \u2206\u03a8 [1,2]. The current literature suggests that mMPT is mediated via the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore [3-5]. Studies have shown that glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3\u03b2) is immediately proximal to the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and acts as a point of integration for many protective signals . Thus, GSK-3\u03b2 is a crucial enzyme involved in preventing mMPT through regulating the opening and closing of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore [7,8]. Additional studies involving ischemic reperfusion of cardiac myocytes have demonstrated that inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2 can prevent the dissipation of \u2206\u03a8 during oxidative stress [9-11].\nOne of the multiple protective proteins that converge on GSK-3\u03b2 is the phosphorylated form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) . Flynn et al.  has previously demonstrated that after RNA suppresses ERK \u2206\u03a8 collapses during oxidative stress in human lens epithelial cells (HLE-B3) cells. Furthermore, studies conducted on metastatic carcinoma cells have shown that phosphorylated ERK can cause GSK-3\u03b2 to become phosphorylated at its inhibitory serine, thus inactivating the enzyme . Combined, these studies suggest that ERK can prevent the disruption of \u2206\u03a8 by inactivating GSK-3\u03b2, presumably blocking the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore. However, as will be demonstrated in this study, inhibiting ERK phosphorylation can, itself, cause mitochondrial depolarization regardless of the activity of GSK-3\u03b2.\nTo date, the role that GSK-3\u03b2 plays regarding preventing mitochondrial depolarization has not been established in an ocular system. In the current study, we demonstrate that inactivating GSK-3\u03b2 activity (as monitored by its failure to phosphorylate glycogen synthase) using the pharmacological inhibitor SB216763 has a regulatory function in preventing mitochondrial depolarization. Furthermore, this study will reveal that the mitoprotection normally afforded by GSK-3\u03b2 inactivation may be circumvented by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, which culminates in inhibition of Bcl-2 phosphorylation, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family.\nThe Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene (UO126) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (SB216763) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors SP600125 (JNK Inhibitor II) and AS601245 (JNK Inhibitor V) were purchased from EMD Millipore Chemicals (Billerica, MA). Stock inhibitors were prepared by adding to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as follows: 20 mM for UO126, 16 mM for SB216763, 40 mM for SP600125, and 40 mM for AS601245. The mitochondrial dye 1H-benzimidazolium-5,6-dichloro-2-[3-(5,6-dichloro-1,3-diethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-ylidene)-1-propenyl]-1,3-diethyl-iodide (JC-1) was obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). All other reagents were acquired from other commercially available sources as previously reported .\nHLE-B3 cells, a human lens epithelial cell line immortalized by the SV-40 virus , were obtained from U. Andley (Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, St. Louis, MO). Authentication of the HLE-B3 cell line was verified with STR profile analysis (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), which confirmed that the cell line was human and of female origin, as originally reported by Andley et al. . A copy of the STR profile is available upon request. All studies with HLE-B3 cells were performed with prefrozen stock cells (maintained in liquid nitrogen) between passages 14 and 17. No experiments exceeded five passages beyond the initial stock cell passage. The cells were maintained in minimal essential media (MEM) containing 5.5 mM glucose supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Sacramento, CA), 2 mM L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and 0.02 g/l gentamycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2\u201395% O2 . Cells were sub-cultured 4 to 5 days before the experiment and placed in MEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Twenty-four hours before the day of the experiment, the cells were switched to serum-free MEM. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments followed a common protocol: Cells were maintained in atmospheric O2 (about 21%) for 90 min, then switched to hypoxic conditions (about 1% O2) for 180 min, followed by reintroduction to atmospheric O2. Each experiment was executed with control DMSO-only cells (mock inhibitor treatment) and cells treated with inhibitors. The DMSO concentration per experiment never exceeded 0.05%.\nBovine eyes obtained from a local abattoir were transported on ice to the laboratory, where the lenses were removed aseptically. Bovine lens epithelial cells (BLECs) were isolated and cultured in 20% bovine calf serum\u2013supplemented Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium. All studies with BLECs were performed on cells of passage 2.\nWhole cell lysates were collected from HLE-B3 cultures using the hot protein extraction method as described by Henrich et al. . The cell cultures were rinsed at room temperature in final concentration: 150 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 40 mM sodium phosphate dibasic), pH 7.4, before the monolayers were lysed with hot lysis buffer (about 100 \u00b0C), subsequently scraped into 1.7 ml micro centrifuge tubes, and immediately sonicated. The lysis buffer consisted of 0.12 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 20% glycerol . Part of the lysate samples were removed and used to determine the protein concentration. The protein concentration was calculated by using a DC protein assay kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). The lysate samples contained 25 \u00b5g of protein, 1X SDS laemmli buffer, and 1.5 \u00b5l 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysate samples were then boiled for 5 min and the proteins resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The electrophoresis and western blot apparatus were from Hoefer Scientific (Holliston, MA).\nFor western blot analysis, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) for 60 min. These membranes were probed overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies at a 1:1,000 dilution. The blots were then rinsed in TTBS for 5 min 4X and then incubated in either goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:10,000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were again rinsed in TTBS (4X 5 min washes), and proteins were detected using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL) . Probed membranes were visualized on a Fluoro Chem TM 8900 imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).\nPrimary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The antibodies used in this study included rabbit anti-Bcl-2-associated X (BAX), rabbit anti-glycogen synthase, rabbit anti-phosphoglycogen synthase (Ser641), rabbit anti-phospho-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9), rabbit anti-GSK-3\u03b2, mouse anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr202/Tyr204), rabbit anti-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, rabbit anti-phospho-Bcl-2 (Ser70), rabbit anti-Bcl-2, and rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63). Rabbit anti-actin was provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).\nAfter the HLE-B3 cells were subjected to inhibitor treatments, the cells were stained with JC-1 to determine the mitochondrial membrane potential. JC-1 is a membrane permeant lipophilic dye that exists as J-aggregates in the mitochondrial matrix (red fluorescence) and as monomers in the cytoplasm (green fluorescence). During mitochondrial depolarization, the red J-aggregates flow out of the mitochondria and accumulate in the cytosol as green monomers . Thus, depolarization can be measured as an increasing green fluorescent/red fluorescent intensity ratio.\nThe JC-1 assay was performed as follows. HLE-B3 cell monolayers were maintained in serum-free MEM with or without inhibitor treatment, brought through atmospheric oxygen into hypoxia, and then later switched back to atmospheric oxygen as described above. At the end of the hypoxic exposure, the hypoxic media on cells (oxygen depleted) were poured off, and fresh (oxygen rich) serum-free MEM (with or without an inhibitor) was added containing 5 \u00b5g/ml JC-1 for 30 min in a tissue culture incubator. The stained HLE-B3 cells were then rinsed twice using serum-free MEM, and fresh oxygenated serum-free MEM (with or without inhibitor, but no JC-1 dye) was added. A random field of cells was imaged every 2.5 min for 60 min using an X10 objective on a confocal microscope (Ziess LSM410, LSM410, Thornwood, NY). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the microscope was set to simultaneously detect green emission (540 nm) and red emission (595 nm) channels using a dual bandpass filter .\nA caspase-3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) was used to determine apoptosis. HLE-B3 cell monolayers were maintained in serum-free MEM with or without treatment and brought through our experimental protocol, which included atmospheric oxygen into 3 h of hypoxia, and then subsequently switched back to atmospheric oxygen. Treatment included SB216763 (12 \u00b5M), UO126 (10 \u00b5M), staurosporine (100 nM), or 0.05% DMSO vehicle maintained throughout the course of the experiment. Sixty minutes after atmospheric oxygen was reintroduced, all samples were then lysed using our lysis buffer (0.12 M Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol). Part of the lysate samples was removed and used to determine the protein concentration. The protein concentration was calculated by using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Apoptotic activity was determined following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using 10 \u00b5g of protein.\nImages from JC-1 confocal microscopy were separated into individual red and green channels using ImageJ (Baltimore, MD). The background fluorescence was removed from each image before the intensity was measured. The fluorescence intensity signal from each image was quantified for the entire image and expressed as the ratio of green fluorescent intensity over red fluorescent intensity. Western blot densitometry was determined using ImageJ, and related statistics was determined using GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, CA).\nJC-1 analysis of the DMSO mock-treated cells exposed to various cell culture conditions was implemented to determine whether environmental stress (i.e., hypoxia, atmospheric oxygen, or reversal from one condition to the other) elicited mitochondrial depolarization. Four conditions were tested: cells grown in constant atmospheric oxygen, cells switched from atmospheric oxygen to hypoxia, cells switched from hypoxia to atmospheric oxygen, and cells maintained in continuous hypoxia. Under all tested conditions, the cells did not depolarize, indicating that continuous hypoxia, atmospheric oxygen, and switching cell culture environments (hypoxia to atmospheric oxygen or atmospheric oxygen to hypoxia) do not induce depolarization (Figure 1).\nTo investigate the role GSK-3\u03b2 plays in regulating cellular mitoprotection with cells maintained in hypoxia and subsequently exposed to atmospheric oxygen, HLE-B3 cells were treated with the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, SB216763. Non-phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 is the active form of the enzyme, and in this form, the enzyme is capable of phosphorylating numerous downstream substrates including glycogen synthase (GS) . The phosphorylation of GS is thus a useful parameter for monitoring GSK-3\u03b2 activity. Cultures of HLE-B3 cells were grown on 100 mm dishes until >85% confluence. Cells were treated with 12 \u00b5M SB216763 or mock-treated with DMSO (control). After 90 min in ambient oxygen, the cells were placed under hypoxic conditions (about 1% O2) for 3 h and then switched back to atmospheric oxygen (about 21% O2) for 3 h. Samples were collected from cells consistently maintained in atmospheric oxygen (control), immediately after hypoxic exposure and 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h of reexposure to atmospheric oxygen. Western blot analysis showed that the HLE-B3 cells subjected to SB216763 treatment had levels of GSK-3\u03b2 and phosphoglycogen synthase kinase-3beta (pGSK-3\u03b2) similar to those of the controls (Figure 2). However, treatment with SB216763 resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of GS. The failure to phosphorylate GS indicates the active site of GSK-3\u03b2 was inactivated. The continued presence of pGSK-3\u03b2 in the treated cells was because the autophosphorylation site of GSK-\u03b2 was unaffected by SB216763 . A key question that we wished to address in this study was whether inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2 activity positively correlated with preventing mitochondrial depolarization. In a recent related study , we observed that SB216763-treated cells monitored for mMPT using emission spectroscopy displayed suppressed mitochondrial depolarization relative to the control DMSO mock-treated cells.\nA parallel experiment, using the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126, was also conducted on HLE-B3 cells to determine whether inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation had any impact on the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 and GS. Lens cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M UO126 or DMSO and subsequently placed in hypoxic conditions for 3 h. Following the hypoxic exposure, new media were added to the culture dishes, and the cells were exposed to atmospheric oxygen for up to 3 h in the continued presence and absence of UO126. Lysates of these cells were collected from cells maintained consistently in atmospheric oxygen, after the hypoxic exposure and 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after atmospheric oxygen was reintroduced. Analysis of the western blot membranes showed marked inhibition of p42 ERK1/2 and p44 ERK1/2 (Figure 3, upper panel, left) relative to the control cells. The loss of ERK1/2 phosphorylation did not affect the relative levels of GSK-3\u03b2 or pGSK-3\u03b2 compared with the DMSO controls (Figure 3, upper panel, right), whereas inhibiting ERK phosphorylation prevented the downstream phosphorylation of GS. Therefore, the configuration of the ratio of pGSK-3\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 and pGS/GS appeared identical irrespective of whether SB216763 or UO126 was used (compare the bar graphs of Figure 2 and Figure 3). Given the similarity in the profile of the ratio of pGSK-3\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 and pGS/GS, a critical question was whether UO126-treated cells, similar to SB216763-treated cells, likewise prevented mitochondrial depolarization relative to the control DMSO mock-treated cells or whether UO126-treated cells were prone to mMPT.\nParallel studies were conducted using JC-1 analysis. HLE-B3 cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M UO126 or DMSO and then placed under hypoxic conditions for 3 h. The cells were exposed to the JC-1 dye for 30 min in atmospheric oxygen. Following the JC-1 application, fresh media with U0126 or DMSO were added to the culture plates. The cells were subsequently observed with confocal microscopy and the green and red intensities recorded every 2.5 min for 60 min. The green to red ratio of the UO126-treated cells markedly increased over the time course relative to the control cells, indicating the loss of \u2206\u03a8 (Figure 3, bottom panel).\nAs discussed above, comparison of the western blots for pGSK-3\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 and pGS/GS between the two inhibitor treatments generated profiles that were similar, if not, identical (compare Figure 2 and Figure 3). However, whereas treatment with the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, SB216763, likely blocked opening of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pores, effectively suppressing depolarization , treatment with UO126 elicited profound depolarization relative to the control cells (Figure 3, bottom panel). We therefore examined in greater detail the outcome of each inhibitor on the BAX, Bcl-2, and pBcl-2 levels.\nLysates from all experimental treatments were evaluated to determine the levels of Bcl-2, pBcl-2, and BAX. Western blot membranes from the SB216763- and UO126-treated cells relative to their respective controls indicated no alteration in the levels of BAX for the treated and control cells (Figure 4, upper panel and Figure 5, upper panel). The relative levels of pBcl-2 and Bcl-2 were not altered for the SB216763-treated cells compared with the control cells (Figure 4, middle panel). In contrast, the UO126-treated cells displayed significantly diminished levels of pBcl-2 under all culture conditions, including normoxic control, hypoxic exposure, and the reintroduction of oxygen subsequent to hypoxic exposure (Figure 5, middle panel); a significant loss of Bcl-2 was also observed but, interestingly, only during the reintroduction of oxygen phase (Figure 5, middle panel).\nOf particular note, treatment with UO126 (Figure 5, upper panel, left and bottom panels) but not with SB216763 (Figure 4, upper panel left and bottom panel) prevented the phosphorylation of c-JUN, through all culture conditions. The phosphorylation of c-Jun is a useful parameter for monitoring JNK activity. That is, UO126, while effectively inhibiting ERK phosphorylation (refer to Figure 3, upper panel, left), was nonetheless equally effective in inactivating JNK activity. This observation imposed a burden of proof upon us to determine whether the ERK pathway or the JNK pathway negatively impacted the pBcl-2 levels.\nHLE-B3 cells were treated with JNK inhibitors, SP600125 (5 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M, or 20 \u00b5M), AS601245 (5 \u00b5M, and 10 \u00b5M, 20 \u00b5M), or DMSO vehicle (control). Phosphorylated JNK is the active form of the enzyme, and in this form, the enzyme is capable of phosphorylating numerous downstream substrates, including c-Jun. The phosphorylation of c-Jun is thus a useful parameter for monitoring JNK activity. Treated and control cells were placed in hypoxic conditions for 3 h and then switched to atmospheric oxygen for 3 h. After the switch to atmospheric oxygen, the hypoxic media were removed from the cultures, and fresh oxygenated media containing either inhibitor or vehicle were added. Lysates of all the cells were collected after 3 h exposure in atmospheric oxygen. SP600125 and AP601245 markedly reduced phospho-c-Jun at all concentrations relative to the control cells (Figure 6). Further analysis indicated no change in the levels of BAX, Bcl-2, or pBcl-2 for cells treated with SP600125 or AS601245 versus cells treated with DMSO vehicle (Figure 6). A slight increase in the levels of pERK were observed with either inhibitor treatment cells relative to the control cells, the meaning of which is not immediately evident to us. However, whereas UO126 negatively impacted JNK activity (Figure 5), the JNK inhibitors did not cross-inactivate ERK phosphorylation (Figure 6). We therefore concluded that inhibition of the ERK pathway, not the JNK pathway, elicited the inhibition of phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (Figure 5).\nTo determine if the inhibition of ERK or GSK-3\u03b2 activity influence the onset of apoptosis, an active caspase-3 ELISA was implemented. As above, the HLE-B3 cells were treated with either 12 \u00b5M SB216763, 10 \u00b5M UO126, or 0.05% DMSO. The 100 nM staurosporine concentration was used as a positive activator of caspase-3. Cells were incubated for 90 min and then placed in hypoxia for 180 min. At the end of the hypoxic exposure, the media were removed from the treated and untreated cells, and fresh media were added. The cells were then placed in atmospheric oxygen for 60 min. SB216763 and U0126 were administered throughout the duration of the experiment. At the end of this 60 min period, all samples were lysed with lysis buffer. The DMSO mock-treated cells displayed minimal capase-3 activation relative to the cells treated with staurosporine (positive control), which showed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity (Figure 7). The UO126- and SB216763-treated cells demonstrated levels of capase-3 activity similar to the DMSO mock-treated cells (Figure 7). The lack of caspase-3 activity in the UO126- and SB216763-treated cells indicate that apoptosis did not occur in the presence of either inhibitor, although the UO126 treatment elicited mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (refer to Figure 3, bottom panel).\nTo determine that our results (and consequent interpretations) had not been compromised by the viral transformation of the HLE-B3 cells, we repeated the UO126 treatment, as described above with HLE-B3 cells, with secondary cultures of normal bovine lens epithelial cells. Inhibition of p42 ERK1/2 and p44 ERK1/2 relative to the control cells was noted (Figure 8, upper panel). As with the HLE-B3 cells (Figure 3, upper panel, right), neither GSK-3\u03b2 nor pGSK-3\u03b2 (Figure 8, middle panel) was diminished, compared with the DMSO controls. Likewise, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation prevented the downstream phosphorylation of GS (compare Figure 3, upper panel, right and Figure 8, middle panel).\nWe further investigated the effect of UO126 treatment on BAX, Bcl-2, and pBcl-2 levels using secondary cultures of bovine lens epithelial cells. Lysates were evaluated with western blot analysis to determine the levels of BAX, Bcl-2, and pBcl-2. Western blot membranes from the UO126-treated cells relative to their respective controls indicated some lane loading variability, but no obvious loss, in the levels of BAX (Figure 8, bottom panel), similar to that of the HLE-B3 cells (Figure 5, upper left panel). As with the HLE-B3 cells (Figure 5, upper left panel), the UO126-treated cells displayed a significant reduction in pBcl-2 under all culture conditions: normoxic control, hypoxic exposure, and the reintroduction of oxygen (Figure 8, bottom panel). Of interest, unlike the HLE-B3 cells (Figure 5, middle panel) where a significant loss of Bcl-2 was noted (but only during the reintroduction of the oxygen phase), there was no dramatic reduction in the levels of Bcl-2 between the treated and untreated cells under any condition (Figure 8, bottom panel). Finally, as first observed with HLE-B3 cells (Figure 5, upper left panel), UO126 elicited the inhibition of phosphorylation of c-JUN, through all culture conditions (Figure 8, bottom panel).\nParallel studies with UO126 were conducted using JC-1 analysis. Normal bovine cell cultures were treated with 10 \u00b5M UO126 or DMSO and then placed under hypoxic conditions for 3 h. The cells were exposed to the JC-1 dye for 30 min in atmospheric oxygen. Following the JC-1 application, fresh media with U0126 or DMSO were added to the culture plates. The cells were subsequently observed with confocal microscopy and the green and red intensities recorded every 2.5 min for 60 min. As with the UO126-treated HLE-B3 cells (refer to Figure 3, bottom panel) the green to red ratio of the UO126-treated bovine lens cells markedly increased over the time course relative to the control cells, indicating the loss of \u2206\u03a8 (Figure 9).\nTo establish our reference baseline, it was first necessary to demonstrate that the experimental manipulation of switching cells from hypoxia to atmospheric oxygen or vice versa, from atmospheric oxygen to hypoxia, was not, of itself, sufficient oxidative stress to elicit mitochondrial depolarization (Figure 1). Once established that the physical manipulation of switching cell cultures from one oxygen pressure to another did not impose mitochondrial depolarization, we investigated the regulatory function of GSK-3\u03b2 insofar as its ability to convey mitochondrial resistance to depolarization.\nFirst, we sought to clarify whether blocking GSK-3\u03b2\u2019s autophosphorylation site or inactivating its catalytic active site conferred prevention of mitochondrial depolarization. To monitor the enzyme\u2019s active, catalytic site, we scrutinized the phosphorylation of a downstream substrate of GSK-3\u03b2, glycogen synthase (GS). Our data revealed that SB216763 did not block the autophosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 relative to control cells, but successfully eliminated the phosphorylation of GS, indicating that the catalytic site of GSK-3\u03b2 was inactivated (Figure 2). Stated another way, the failure to phosphorylate GS, but not the autophosphorylation site of GSK-3\u03b2, appears to be a better predictor of whether inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2\u2019s enzymatic activity positively correlates with blocking mitochondrial membrane permeability transition. In a recent report using the specific GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, SB216763, we demonstrated that \u201cinhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 activity by SB216763 blocked mitochondrial membrane permeability transition relative to the slow but consistent depolarization observed with the control cells.\u201d We concluded that inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2 activity with the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor SB216763 provides positive protection against mitochondrial depolarization .\nThe role of GSK-3\u03b2 and how it may be influenced by upstream signaling mechanisms has been the focus of numerous studies. \u201cThere is evidence in different cell types  that anti-apoptotic responses can be mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Akt/PKB serine-threonine protein kinase, p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases or extracellular response kinases (ERKs), Raf, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).\u201d To further delve into this issue, using the lens cell model, we compared and contrasted the pGSK-3\u03b2 /GSK-3\u03b2, as well as the pGS /GS western blot profiles of cells treated with an inhibitor of ERK against the known catalytic site inhibitor of GSK-3\u03b2, SB216763 (refer to above). We followed up with a JC-1 evaluation to monitor whether ERK inhibitor treatment prompted mitochondrial depolarization or whether, like SB216763, inhibiting ERK phosphorylation imposed resistance to mitochondrial depolarization .\nSimilar to the treatment with SB216763 (Figure 2), treatment with UO126 had no effect on autophosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 relative to the control cells, but successfully eliminated the phosphorylation of GS (Figure 3, upper panel, right). However, whereas treatment with SB216763 resulted in suppression of mitochondrial depolarization , unexpectedly, the UO126-treated cells displayed profound depolarization (Figure 3, bottom panel). We therefore sought to explain the apparent discrepancy between the similarity of the SB216763 and UO126 profiles of pGSK-3\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 and pGS/GS and the observation that the former  but not the latter (Figure 3) conferred resistance to mitochondrial depolarization.\nWestern blot analysis of HLE-B3 cells treated with SB216763 or UO126 showed that the BAX levels were unchanged relative to the untreated, control cells (compare Figure 4 versus Figure 5). Moreover, the BAX content of the UO126-treated normal bovine lens epithelial cells was similar relative to the control cells (Figure 8, bottom panel). These data support the notion that BAX does not play a direct role in lens epithelial cell resistance to mitochondrial depolarization. We therefore directed our attention to answering the question, \u201cIs it the continuous expression of Bcl-2 or the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 that confers resistance to mitochondrial depolarization?\u201d The UO126-treated virally transformed HLE-B3 cells, and the normal bovine lens epithelial cells demonstrated a propensity to depolarize (compare Figure 3, bottom panel and Figure 9). We took advantage of our observation that UO126 treatment with HLE-B3 cells instigated a loss of Bcl-2 (but only under the condition of reintroduction of oxygen (refer to Figure 5) whereas UO126-treatment with normal bovine lens epithelial cells did not diminish the levels of Bcl-2 (Figure 8, bottom panel), this although with both types of cells, a profound loss of pBcl-2 was apparent under all conditions (compare Figure 5, top panel, left with Figure 8, bottom panel). Therefore, since the bovine cells depolarized without the loss of Bcl-2, we conclude that pBcl-2 confers anti-depolarization resistance in lens epithelial cells.\nLei et al. 2002 [20-24] stated, \u201cthis phosphorylation has been reported to inhibit the pro-survival function of Bcl. This conclusion, however, is controversial as other studies have indicated that phosphorylation may enhance the anti-apoptotic actions of Bcl-2\u201d [25-27]. Data from our study lend support to the latter statement in that the depolarization observed with UO126 treatment is caused by a lack of pBcl-2 (compare Figure 3 and Figure 5 with Figure 8 and Figure 9). The lack of pBcl-2 likely results in a loss of Bcl-2\u2019s antiapoptotic function as reported by others. Cellular apoptosis is regulated, in part, by maintaining a balance between the levels of the prosurvival protein, Bcl-2, and the proapoptotic protein, BAX. BAX is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Activation of BAX causes its translocation to the mitochondrial outer membrane and induces mitochondrial depolarization. However, before BAX can initiate this process, the protein must first translocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. Bcl-2 influences apoptosis by regulating the translocation of BAX to the mitochondria [28,29]. Any decrease in the levels of Bcl-2 (or in our case, pBcl-2) is likely to permit the translocation of BAX from the cytosol to the mitochondria and induce mitochondrial depolarization. Disruption of the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane would then be the cause of the initiation of the loss of \u2206\u03a8, often cited as an early predictor of the onset of apoptosis.\nPrevious studies in our laboratory have shown that UO126 inhibits not only ERK phosphorylation but also JNK activity (unpublished data). Studies have shown that pJNK mediates the phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 [20-25]. Thus, as this relates to the studies described here, one possible explanation for the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential could have been attributed to the loss of JNK activity. To determine whether this was the case, we analyzed JNK activity with UO126 treatment. A common measure of JNK activity is to monitor the phosphorylation of one of its downstream substrates, c-Jun, where inhibition of the phosphorylation of c-Jun indicates inactivation of JNK. The level of phospho-c-Jun was similar with SB216763 treatment relative to control cells (Figure 4). UO126 inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation (Figure 5). Moreover, the resulting inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation with treatment by UO126 was accompanied by an apparent loss of pBcl-2, thus suggesting a potential connection between the JNK pathway and mitoprotection (Figure 5). UO126 treatment, since it inhibited JNK activity, complicated our ability to definitively interpret the data, in that our results would not permit us to immediately distinguish whether the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK or JNK influenced the downstream reduction in pBcl-2 levels.\nIt therefore became necessary to determine which of the two pathways, ERK or JNK, was influencing the phosphorylation of Bcl-2. HLE-B3 cells were treated with two specific inhibitors of JNK activation. Analysis of the levels of phospho-c-Jun revealed that SP600125 and AS601245 effectively reduced the levels of phospho-c-Jun relative to that of the controls without affecting the pBcl-2 levels (Figure 6). Collectively, the data reported in Figure 5 and Figure 6 allowed us to assert that inactivating JNK does not influence Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Instead, inhibiting ERK causes the loss of Bcl-2 phosphorylation. We therefore conclude that inhibiting ERK phosphorylation overrides the mitoprotection otherwise afforded by SB216763 presumably because of the loss of pBcl-2 (Figure 5 and Figure 8).\nMitochondrial depolarization is often cited as an early indicator of the onset of apoptosis. However, our studies establish that despite the mitochondrial depolarization initiated by UO126 treatment for HLE-B3 cells (Figure 3, bottom panel) in conjunction with the loss of pBcl-2 (Figure 5), the degree of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition was at an insufficient level to induce apoptosis in human lens epithelial cells, as indicated by the lack of active caspase-3 (Figure 7). Our result is not all that unexpected because it has previously been shown that there is considerable intracellular heterogeneity in mitochondrial membrane potential of mitochondria . In effect, the degree of mitochondrial depolarization as indicated by the JC-1 dye represents the collective states of depolarization from a heterogeneous population of mitochondria. We conclude that one must exercise caution when equating mitochondrial depolarization with the onset of apoptosis. Cellular apoptosis/necrosis should be determined only after examination with annexin V/propidium iodide, DNA fragmentation, or caspase-3 or -9 cleavage, or some combination thereof.\nIn conclusion, the studies presented here further support our previous assertion  that GSK-3\u03b2 is a critical upstream regulator of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition for human lens epithelial cells cultured in atmospheric oxygen. In this study, we have established a direct relationship between the active catalytic site of GSK-3\u03b2 and the normal functioning of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore to open and close. However, inhibiting ERK phosphorylation indirectly overrides the otherwise protective influence of GSK-3\u03b2 to resist mitochondrial membrane permeability transition through a concomitant loss of pBcl-2 levels leading to mitochondrial depolarization. Restated, the fact that SB216763 and UO126 prevent the phosphorylation of GS suggests that GS phosphorylation, itself, may be regulated by one of the many signaling pathways activated by ERK independent of GSK-3\u03b2. At the same time, the ERK pathway also likely independently influences Bcl-2 phosphorylation. The mechanism by which UO126 administration leads to preventing phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is currently not understood and warrants further investigation.\nRecent studies in our laboratory have shown that UO126 treatment elicits a significant decrease in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but only upon reintroduction from hypoxia to atmospheric oxygen (unpublished observation). However, UO126 does not have an effect on VEGF expression in hypoxia-maintained cells . VEGF acts as a prosurvival factor in hypoxic lens epithelial cells by maintaining consistent expression of the prosurvival protein Bcl-2, which likely prevents the translocation of cytosolic BAX to the outer mitochondrial membrane, thus preventing the initiation of mitochondrial depolarization . Our laboratory is interested in regulating VEGF as a cell survival protein. Current studies in the laboratory are directed toward elucidating the potential role of GSK-3\u03b2 in managing the sustained expression of VEGF and how VEGF expression regulates the levels of Bcl-2 and its phosphorylated counterpart as it influences downstream impact on lenticular mitoprotection in atmospheric oxygen (manuscript in preparation).\nThe authors express their gratitude to Lawrence Oakford for the preparation of all figures and images in this manuscript and to I-Fen Chang for technical support in obtaining the JC-1 image analysis data.",

    "text": "Sure, Jon Bon Jovi was in the house, and I thought that was cool. But the biggest rock star of the night was a petite nun who refuses to accept that homelessness and poverty are inevitable.\nHer name is Sister Mary Scullion, and she is the co-founder of Project H.O.M.E. in Philadelphia. Wednesday night I joined nearly 1,000 of her closest friends at the Marriott Hotel for \"Home at 20,\" the organization's 20th anniversary celebration of advocacy and service. Comcast and the Phillies were presenting sponsors.\n\"...Sister Mary, 55, has become the darling of luminaries like Bill Clinton, though that hasn't impacted her humility or her famously ribald sense of humor. When Jon Bon Jovi (a loyal Project supporter) described Mary to the press as a nun 'who swears and spits,' the good sister merely replied, 'I do not spit' - and then returned to her work of tirelessly saving her city, one desperate citizen at a time.\"\nThe gala featured warm remarks from several speakers, including co-founder Joan Dawson McConnon, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. Bon Jovi received the inaugural Golden Heart Award, and said the honor meant more to him than being inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame.\nRoberts discussed the Honickman Learning Center and Comcast Technology Labs, which greatly contributes to the \"E\" in Project H.O.M.E. - Education. The 38,000-square-foot facility includes hundreds of computers, interactive education programs, music and recording equipment, video production capabilities, a college access center and more.\n\"At Comcast,\" said Roberts, \"we believe that knowing how to use communications technology can help to prepare young people for richer lives and good jobs. To see 300 kids a year have their lives changed in one of the finest learning centers in the country is just wonderful.\"\nComcast also produced several videos that played throughout the evening, each an inspirational case study of lives being turned around - or saved - through Project H.O.M.E.\nAs for the other letters in Project H.O.M.E.? \"H\" represents Housing, \"O\" is for Opportunities for employment, and \"M\" is for Medical care.\n\"M\" could also stand for \"Mary,\" who summed up a remarkable evening in her closing comments.\n\"At Project H.O.M.E., we believe none of us is home until all of us are home. Tonight we are well on the way to the home we yearn for. And there's no better way to get there than all together with you.\"",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 On Jan. 17, the eve of the March for Life, pilgrims from the Archdiocese of New Orleans began the day in praise to God in Mass at their hotel, and ended it in benediction at the 10th annual \u201cLife is Very Good\u201d evening of prayer and rally at EagleBank Arena at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\u201cBe open and allow God to come into our heart,\u201d Angrisano told 8,000 young people from across the United States who came from as far away as North Dakota.\nHe mentioned how the event has grown from its inception 10 years earlier with only 350 people.\n\u201cWe rally ourselves, we open our hearts today because tomorrow we stand and make a difference in the world,\u201d Angrisano said.\nBishop Burbidge said another reason \u201clife is very good\u201d is that God put people in their lives, such as parents, teachers and youth ministers, who love and direct them.\nTo set the mood for his joyful talk, speaker Chris Stefanick of Colorado invited several youths to the stage for a sing-off, with the crowd selecting their favorite duo of the three groups.\nStefanick said joy transformed his heart as a youth.\n1. Give thanks in all circumstances. \u201cGratitude fuels joy.\u201d It is the key that will unlock the smile on your face.\n2. Stop compromising with sin. Cut the bad things out of your life, whether it is a friend, a website, whatever.\n3. Carry your body upright with a sense of dignity and royalty. \u201cYou are royalty. \u2026 That\u2019s how the almighty God looks at us. A cheerful face leads to a cheerful heart,\u201d he said. Carry yourself like a winner, and people will see you as one.\n4. Serve others. Lose yourself in love and service.\n5. Keep your mind on the big picture. Don\u2019t let the rough pages (trials) in your life compare with the bigger story. Stefanick said Christians were founded in love. \u201cThe love of Jesus Christ for you, that\u2019s the source of our joy,\u201d he said.\nAngrisano led the attendees in worship before the evening closed with benediction. He told them to give their hurts to God.\nEarlier in the day at the Louisiana Right to Life \u201cGeaux Forth 2019\u201d rally at the Wagner Theatre near the White House, the crew from New Orleans heard pro-life talks from two speakers who had personal experiences with abortions.\nKrista Corbello talked about her mother choosing not to abort her even though she was encouraged to get an abortion because she was unmarried and her boyfriend had abandoned her. She later met her biological father and learned he had aborted a baby who would have been her sibling. She also explained several abortion procedures to the youth.\nSpeaker Melissa Ohden should have died from a saline solution abortion procedure her mother had, but God had other plans for her life. She said pro-choice advocates say abortion is a choice, but very few women have a choice. Sixty-four percent of those polled say they were pressured into an abortion. Her mother was one of them and was never told her daughter had survived the abortion.",

    "text": "The Tampa Bay Rays took to the road on Monday with their sights set firmly on collecting their first winning road trip since June 17-21, when they took four of five from the Nationals and Indians. They also set out with an opportunity to get back to .500 and then some. The Rays, however, were unsuccessful in both endeavors, and ended the road trip with a 3-4 record after being chewed up and spit out by the unrelenting Blue Jays of Toronto.\n\u2026And the downward spiral continues its slow grind toward the end of the season.\nThis isn\u2019t to say the past has been uneventful \u2015 far from it. Joe Maddon\u2019s Chicago Cubs clinched their first playoff berth since 2008. Not to be outdone, the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets, Kansas City Royals, and Toronto Blue Jays will also play relevant baseball past October 4th, setting the table for what promises to be a compelling postseason. Now if the Houston Astros could hurry up and realize their postseason aspirations. I digress.\nOn the bright side, there were three promising games on the Rays road trip, all of which came at the hands of the Boston Red Sox. Let\u2019s take a look at those games, and the peripheral events that surrounded the team this week.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s contest, curious news broke (via the Tampa Bay Times), the Atlanta Braves are allegedly interested in calling St. Petersburg their Spring Training home at some point in the near future. A proposal by SportsPark Partners LLC a group \u2015 a development group led by Darryl LeClair \u2015 would move the Braves Spring Training quarters from the Orlando area to a new stadium complex in the Toytown area of St. Petersburg.\nYou might recall, LeClair put together a Rays stadium proposal in the Carillon area of St. Pete three years ago. That plan, however, never gained traction with the team\u2019s ownership group.\nThe initial bid on the Toytown property was made the beginning of the month, though the bid was not made public at that point, and it was assumed that LeClair might consider using the property toward another Rays stadium bid \u2015 after all, it\u2019s in the East/Central part of Pinellas County, it\u2019s right off the highway, and it\u2019s not far from the Howard-Frankland Bridge. It should also be noted, Pinellas County has the money to pool together for a new stadium.\nThe team chose not to comment on things until later in the week.\nMeanwhile on the field, Mikie Mahtook hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning and Matt Moore recovered from a tough start to fan seven as the Rays beat the Red Sox 5-2.\nMoore threw an incredibly inefficient 32 pitch first inning, though he settled in and hurled 5-2/3 innings of scoreless baseball from that point on. The lefty didn\u2019t walk another batter, and collected seven strikeouts, while scattering seven hits. Topping out at 96 mph multiple times throughout his start, the lefty racked up 17 total swings and misses with his four seam fastball (5), change up (6), and curveball (6).\nWord also broke why Nathan Karns hadn\u2019t taken the mound of late, the righty has been shut down for the season due to right forearm tightness.\nBoth Karns and Rays manager Kevin Cash said they are confident the issue is nothing serious and said that at a different point in the season he may have pitched through it. But after Karns went through a 20-pitch session early Tuesday afternoon, the decision was made to be cautious and allow him more time to rest and not risk further injury by having him make another start.\nA pair of former teammates took the hill against one another on Wednesday night, yet Rays hurler Drew Smyly prevailed over Boston\u2019s Rick Porcello. The Tampa Bay Rays broke open a close game late en route to a 6-2 win over the Red Sox.\nSmyly worked around three walks and an HBP, to go along with five scattered hits. He fanned seven in his fourth scoreless start of the season \u2015 the second in as many starts against Boston. Additionally, the scoreless start gave Rays starters their 31st scoreless start of the season \u2015 the most in the Majors after leading the Majors last season with 32. Per the Elias Sports Bureau, Tampa Bay is just the second club in Major League history with 30 starts in back-to-back seasons when the starting pitcher was not charged with a run.\nErasmo Ramirez took the bump in the series finale with Boston and put up another gem. And though he gave up two Red Sox runs in the first inning on a David Ortiz homer (his 36th homer of the season and 502nd of his career), Ramirez settled down and did not allow another runner beyond first over the next six innings \u2015 ultimately retiring 18 of 20 batters faced.\nErasmo has now thrown at least seven innings in three straight starts for the first time at the MLB level. He enters the with an 11-6 record and a 3.65 ERA/3.82 FIP/2.2 WAR line. Not bad for a hurler who was once referred to as \u201cAssmo\u201d by some of readers at DRaysBay.\nThree days after a plan was unveiled to move the Atlanta Braves Spring Training home to St. Petersburg, Major League Baseball and the Tampa Bay Rays issued their first public comments.\nThe Rays appreciate MLB\u2019s attention to this matter. We fully agree with and support their statement, he said in a statement when asked for comment by the media.\nEarlier this week, Major League Baseball and the Tampa Bay Rays learned of the St. Petersburg Sports Park proposal for the first time. Major League Baseball appreciates the support that it has received for the construction of Spring Training facilities throughout the State of Florida. The most pressing need, however, is the construction of a Major League-quality facility for the Rays.\nMajor League Baseball is committed to working with the Rays to secure a new ballpark in cooperation with the Tampa Bay region. This can only happen with the support of local political and business leaders.\nThe Rays & MLB are assuming the Rays will be gone from Tampa Bay in a decade or so, thus diminishing any negative impact of a Braves spring training relocation. In fact, it could be positioned as a consolation prize for Pinellas County.\nThe Rays & MLB want to stay in Tampa Bay, but are using the pressure on Pinellas County\u2019s limited tourist tax bonding capacity to force St. Pete\u2019s hand. Forced to make a decision about where bed tax revenues would be best-spent, the city could allow the Rays permission to begin negotiating for new stadium sites.\nThe Rays & MLB want a taxpayer-funded stadium at Toytown and \u2013 unable to negotiate with Pinellas County right now \u2013 the Rays have coordinated with the Braves, MLB, and developers to orchestrate a bait-and-switch. The proposed 10,000-seat stadium becomes a 25,000-seat stadium and the Rays move closer to the bay bridges. The Braves could even share Bright House Networks Field in Clearwater without major expenditures.\nPransky was quick to note that while option three is a longshot, all three theories could mean a considerable bump in leverage for the Rays as they continue to push for a new stadium.\nThe weekend series against Toronto was a wash. The team played like the Devil Rays, although we got a sense of what\u2019s to be expected out of the Blue Jays in the playoffs. God help whoever they may face.",

But my problems are with getting the current source to work correctly.\nI have tried building the \"Easy Exponential Current Source\" which ought to suit my needs. However the pots range is unusable.\nAll the range is within the 1/3rd of central position on the pot - at either end (upper 1/3rd and lower 1/3rd) the VCO bottoms or tops out with the frequency remaining the same for the rest of the range.\nI can't work out how this is adjusted? Or why it should be so.\nSeems wrong that the super simple solution works better!\nIf only the middle third of the pot is useful, add a 100k resistor between the 15v and the top of the pot and another 100k between the bottom of the pot and the -15v (assuming you are using a 100k pot).\nI've built that vco using the precision expo source and there is no stepping.\nI agree that you might have the transistors in wrong? I laid out my board (accidentally) for matched VBe BC560 type transistors vs. 2N3906 (the C/B/E pinouts are different for the different transistors--doh!).\nHelps to pay better attention to Eagle parts placement Just something to check I guess.\nWith BC559's the current source worked perfectly for about 8 octaves. Trimmed out the V/oct by ear. Works great and temp compensation is good as well.\nI am having matched 2N3906 version fabbed up at EasyEDA now. I guess we'll see if that works....it should.\nUpdate. Matched 3906 version of the TH 3080/13600/13700 expo current source works great. I have tested on both 3080 and 13700. Yep, the thing really works.\nIt's a really good design, simple and easy to build.\nhats off the the mighty TH!\nI'll post more on my website one of these days.\nPaul: one more thing I noticed when I was building this: make sure you have the right cap value in the VCO stage (tied to the OTA). I didn't when I was breadboarding and the thing only went to like 4K an never higher.",

Salt marsh; 4. Cave, Arch, Stack; 5. Bay; 6. Headland; 7. Cliff; 8. Spit; 9. Peninsula.\nTombolos, beaches, salt marshes and spits are formed as a result of deposition. Caves, arches and stacks, bays, headlands, cliffs and peninsulas are formed as a result of erosion. Go to the British Geographer website for details and diagrams of how each of these features are formed.\nWhy might coastal features change over time?\nCoasts are dynamic systems which result in changes over time. Continuous erosion and or deposition will lead to coastal features changing over time.\nHow might coastal features change over time?\nErosion over time of a headland, for example, can lead to the development of a cave which can develop into an arch and eventually a stack and stump. Go to the British Geographer website for further information on these changes along with an over view of how other coastal features change over time.\nWatch the PowerPoint What is a coast? You will see a number of different coasts from around the world. Work with a partner and use the evidence in the photographs to put together an answer to the question, what is a coast? Feedback your answer to the rest of the class and put everyone\u2019s ideas together to create a class definition.\nYour teacher will give you a blank world map and a resource sheet (Coastal Features) with nine images of different coastal features.\nOn the board will be a list of these features: beach; cave, arch, stack; cliff; tombolo, peninsula, spit, salt marsh, headland; bay. You have to see if you can guess which feature is which. Once correctly labelled, use an atlas to locate the different places for each feature on your blank map.\nNext to the label, which should state the place name and coastal feature, you should draw a diagram to show that feature based on the image on the Coastal Features sheet.\nChoose one of the features you have looked at during today\u2019s lesson. Think about how this feature might change over time? Would you expect it to look the same in 100 years\u2019 time? Why do you think the feature you have chosen might look different?",

    "text": "The impostor phenomenon (IP) is increasingly recognized as an important psychological construct for career development, yet empirical research on how it functions in this domain is sparse. We investigated in what way impostor feelings are related to the fear of failure, fear of success, self-esteem, and the career-development aspects career planning, career striving, and the motivation to lead. We conducted two studies with independent samples of university students (N = 212) in a laboratory study and working professionals (N = 110) in an online study. In both samples, impostor feelings were fostered by fear of failure, fear of success, and low self-esteem and they decreased career planning, career striving, and the motivation to lead. A path analysis showed that impostor feelings had the most negative effects on career planning and career striving in students and on the motivation to lead in working professionals. The results suggest that the IP is relevant to career development in different ways at different career stages. Practical implications and interventions to reduce the negative effects of impostor feelings on career development are discussed.",

    "text": "The etiology of human aggressive behavior has not been elucidated. In clinical practice, the definition of aggressive behavior is as follows: attack to property, others, or oneself with the deliberate intention of destruction. Organic psychosis, schizophrenia, mental retardation, emotional disorders, and personality disorders can be associated with aggressive behavior, and most frequently occur in the acute phase of mental illness (Campbell et al. in Psychiatr Clin North Am 15(1):69\u201385 1992). In 1990, a regional epidemiological investigation for violent psychosis in the United States showed that the incidence of aggressive behavior in patients with psychiatric disorders was five times that of normal people. Moreover, 50 % of the patients with psychiatric disorders and 10 % of patients with schizophrenia have histories of making threats, agitation, and aggressive behavior (Sramka et al in Bratisl Lek Listty 93(7):365\u2013366, 1992). This aggressive behavior causes serious threat to the safety of medical staff, the whole society, and even to patients themselves.",

    "text": "The South Fork of the American River is everyone\u2019s favorite California river! As the river flows through the heart of Gold Country, it includes rapids which are challenging yet not extreme. There is plenty of time for you and your rafting companions to indulge in family or group bonding, playful joke telling, and spirited water fighting. In-between the rapids, there\u2019s always a little time for a refreshing swim in the cool, clear water.\nThe South Fork\u2019s long season and its close proximity to Sacramento, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite and the San Francisco Bay Area make this an extremely accessible river trip. The Chili Bar half-day trip is named after a population of Chileans who settled on the South Fork of the American during the California Gold Rush; the trip is short and sweet, with plenty of adventure for both novice and experienced rafters!\nThe South Fork\u2019s exciting Class III whitewater is near-perfect fun for the whole family! The water on the South Fork is released during summer months from hydroelectric facilities located upstream. Such water releases are not subject to the control of El Dorado County or commercial rafting companies.\nTo increase your safety, we expect everyone to watch our 23-minute Whitewater Orientation video before joining us. Watch at www.oars.com/experience/safety/ or call 800-346-6277 to request a free DVD. Please don\u2019t leave home without watching.\nWe meet near our camp store at the OARS American River Outpost at 9:00 AM. Roads around here are winding, so please be sure to allow for plenty of travel time. Our river-side campground and base of operations is in the heart of the twin towns of Lotus and Coloma. Our peaceful hideaway is surrounded by plenty of history, recreational opportunities and cultural activities.\nOnce everyone has arrived, the guides will deliver an orientation and safety talk and fit you with your safety gear. We will then take a 25-minute shuttle ride to the Chili Bar put-in point, where your boats and the rest of your OARS crew await. After practicing your paddle strokes with your guide, we will head downriver to the infamous rapid named Meatgrinder!\nBeautiful river scenes stretch out around us with redtail hawks soaring overhead and the occasional river otter swimming near shore. Exciting rapids like Racehorse Bend, Maya and Triple Threat await us on this enjoyable run! After a short section of class I-II whitewater, we find ourselves at the notorious \u201cTroublemaker\u201d rapid. This solid, class III rapid packs an exhilarating ride. Be sure to smile as we make our way through this rapid as there are often onlookers watching from the shore.\nAfter floating by the historic town of Coloma and the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, where gold was originally discovered in 1848, your trip begins to wind down\u2014but not without a few more stories from your personable and knowledgeable guide. Once we return to the campground, we encourage you to stick around awhile: explore our nature trails, play campground games or just savor your time along the river.\nWe\u2019ll meet you near our camp store at 9:00 AM at the OARS American River Outpost, located at 7330 River Park Drive, behind Hotshot Imaging\u2019s store in Lotus. Click here for a Google Map.\nFrom Sacramento on U.S. Hwy 50: Follow Hwy 50 east toward Placerville and South Lake Tahoe. Take the Ponderosa Road exit (Exit #37), turn left onto Ponderosa/S. Shingle Road and cross over the freeway. At the second stop light, take the right turn on N. Shingle Rd toward Coloma/Lotus.\nAfter about 4.5 miles N. Shingle Road turns into Lotus Road\u2014continue going straight for about 6 more miles. As you approach Lotus, pass through the town\u2019s first stop sign and continue to the 3-way stop sign intersection with Hwy 49. Turn left onto Hwy 49 (north) and cross the bridge over the South Fork of the American. Immediately after crossing the river, you will see the \u201cRiver Park\u201d shopping center on the left, with signs for Hotshot Imaging. Please use the center\u2019s second entrance, where a left-turn lane is provided at River Park Drive. Look to the back of the center, where you will see the entrance to our American River Outpost.\nFrom South Lake Tahoe: Take Hwy 50 west to Placerville. Turn right on Hwy 49 (north) and follow the directions from Placerville listed below.\nFrom Placerville: Proceed north on winding Hwy 49 for about 9.5 miles (about 20\u201425 minutes) through the town of Coloma. Just past Coloma and the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, cross the bridge over the South Fork of the American. Right after crossing the river, you will see the \u201cRiver Park\u201d shopping center on the left, with signs for Hotshot Imaging. Please use the center\u2019s second entrance, where a left-turn lane is provided at River Park Drive. Look to the back of the center, where you will see the entrance to our campground.\nFrom Reno/North Lake Tahoe: Take Interstate 80 west to Auburn. Take Hwy 49 south from Auburn for about 17 miles (about 30 minutes), arriving in the Coloma/Lotus area. After passing through Lotus\u2019 3-way stop sign (intersection with Marshall Grade Road), continue past the gas station and look for us behind the \u201cRiver Park\u201d shopping center on the right. Before Hotshot Imaging\u2019s building, turn right onto River Park Drive and look for the entrance to our campground in the back of the retail center.\nThe closest major airport is in Sacramento (SMF), which is served by most major airlines and car rental companies. Oakland (OAK), San Francisco (SFO) and Reno (RNO) are within a 3-hour drive.\nOne night of FREE camping before or after your trip is available at the OARS American River Outpost in Lotus for everyone who goes rafting with us; additional nights of camping and all nights of camping for non-rafters are $10 per person/night. Advance reservations are required. Please ask an Adventure Consultant about the details of staying at our beautiful riverside camp or click here.\nWe recommend you make reservations well in advance in order to guarantee lodging.\nYou may want to check one week prior to your trip for an up-to-date weather forecast. We recommend you check the following web sites for weather in Coloma, CA: www.weather.com or www.accuweather.com.\nAbility to remain seated and balanced while in a whitewater craft while holding on with at least one hand.\nWear a Type V Coast Guard-approved personal floatation device (maximum chest size of 56 inches). Wearing leg straps may be required to ensure proper fit. Where required, properly wear a helmet.\nAbility to independently board and disembark a boat four to ten times each day. This may require stepping into the boat, and then maneuvering your body over and across tubes and fixed objects into a seated position.\nAbility to independently navigate shoreline terrain, including safely maneuvering around and across boulders, rocks, and slippery and uneven surfaces, under low branches, and around vegetation. This includes the ability to maintain your balance near precipitous ledges or cliffs.\nAbility to independently swim in whitewater or swift currents while wearing a PFD. This includes being an active participant in your own rescue, including having the ability to (a) keep your airway passages sealed while underwater, and regain control of your breathing when being submitted to repeated submersion under waves or currents; (b) orient yourself to new \u201cin-river\u201d surroundings; (c) reposition yourself in the water to different swimming positions; (d) swim aggressively to a boat or to shore in whitewater; (e) receive a rescue rope, paddle, or human assistance, and possibly let go of the same; (f) get out from under an overturned boat.\nAbility to swim 100 yards in flat water while wearing a PFD.\nAbility to assist another passenger who has fallen out of the boat by pulling them back in.\nIt is very important that each trip participant take an active role in their own safety. You will likely encounter wilderness conditions that you are unfamiliar with, and those conditions may change rapidly. It is critical to pay attention at all times, to be aware of your surroundings, and to avoid taking unnecessary risks. Even a non-life threatening injury in a wilderness setting can become a major emergency for you, and can endanger the entire group. Swimming alone or hiking alone is discouraged. Excessive alcohol consumption or illicit drug use is not tolerated. Using common sense, and following both the explicit instruction and the lead of your guides can go a long way towards keeping yourself and the group safe. Some obvious things to avoid in camp and on shore (by way of example) are: walking around without shoes in camp, approaching wild animals, not paying attention to what is above or around your tent site that could harm you, not paying attention to hazards such as poison ivy and rattlesnakes, and walking near precipitous ledges.\nThe best choice is an amphibious shoe that drains water, protects your toes and won\u2019t come off in swirling current. A retired pair of athletic shoes can work well, too. Sport sandals with a heel strap are a good option. Find professional-grade options made by Chaco\u00ae, the official footwear sponsor of OARS guides.\nWe recommend starting with bathing suit/swim trunks and a lightweight synthetic shirt, and then adding layers of synthetic long underwear and fleece as needed.\nProtecting yourself from the sun should be taken very seriously! A hat, sunscreen, lip balm and sunglasses are a must. In many cases, a long-sleeve shirt is the best method for preventing sunburn on your upper body. Light-weight long pants may also be appropriate to protect your legs.\nALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR CHANGING WEATHER! Especially during the months of April, May and early June, California can experience extreme changes in weather.\nWearing cotton items on a river trip is only appropriate when the weather is hot. Wet cotton will chill your body temperature.\nProvided (early-season) wetsuits do not include \u201cwetsuit booties\u201d \u2013 please bring your own, or wear wool socks with tennis shoes as a good alternative.\nPlease let us know if you have any medical issues we will need to consider in planning your trip.\nNo dogs are allowed at the OARS American River Outpost.\nYou may want to bring a small waterproof bag to hold your camera and other items you might need during the day. While most rafting-specific bags are designed to be waterproof, you may also wish to place your camera in a durable, waterproof casing for additional protection. Disposable waterproof and panorama cameras are also a fun option.\nThere are several professional companies taking photos of each raft at some of the South Fork\u2019s larger rapids, which provide great action shots. These companies are not affiliated with OARS and you will need to contact them separately to purchase these pictures. Hotshot Imaging is conveniently based in Lotus right next door to our campground; visit them after your South Fork of the American trip at their storefront on Hwy 49 to order pictures. (To order your photos online, you must request the photo link for your trip from Hotshot Imaging.) For more information, visit http://www.hotshotimaging.com/ or call (530) 621-0400.\nEach participant will need to complete the required trip forms online and submit them no later than 30 days prior to your trip, or immediately if booking within 30 days.\nFinal and full payment is due at the time of booking.\nWe advise that you leave your valuables at home or in your private vehicle and take on the river only what\u2019s absolutely necessary. We also recommend you leave dry shoes and clothing in your car to ensure a comfortable drive home.\nTipping is optional, but appreciated by our staff. If you are wondering how much to tip, you may consider that we operate in a service industry with a host of behind-the-scenes contributors in addition to the guides on your trip. In general, we suggest a gratuity based on 10 \u2013 15% of the trip cost. It is customary on OARS trips for gratuities to be given to the Trip Leader in the form of cash or personal check, who will then distribute appropriately amongst all the guides and support staff.\nIn reviewing your statement, you\u2019ll notice a $1/person/day donation to the American River Conservancy, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the Forks of the American River. One-hundred percent of your tax-deductible donation goes toward conserving the American Rivers watershed. This donation is voluntary and may be removed from your invoice if you choose not to participate.\nFull payment is required at the time of booking. Payments may be made by check, money order or Visa/Mastercard (American Express and Discover incur a 3% processing fee). Receipt of the payment signifies acceptance of our complete Terms and Conditions. Individual departures and trip capacity are strictly limited by the managing agency. Cancelling your trip will incur cancellation fees because holding spots for you means we are likely turning others away who would like to book the trip.\nIf you find it necessary to cancel your trip, please notify us as soon as possible. We do not make exceptions to the cancellation policy for any reason, including weather, wildfire, terrorism, civil unrest or personal emergencies. There is no refund for arriving late or leaving a trip early.\n29 to 3 days prior Payment can be transferred to another trip (within the same year) for $15/person transfer fee. No refund.\nPlease note that different deposit/cancellation policies may apply for charter groups. Refer to the group organizer\u2019s confirmation e-mail for details.\nUnder most circumstances, if you are of an adventurous spirit and in reasonably good health, you should have no problem enjoying an OARS trip. People with medical conditions, including pregnancy, should have a physician\u2019s approval before taking an adventure travel trip.\nEveryone is required to sign a standard liability release form before the trip, acknowledging awareness that there are inherent risks associated with the trip. Due to the nature of the activities, a condition of your participation is that you will sign this form and return it to our office before the trip begins. Anyone who refuses to sign the form will not be allowed to participate, and consistent with OARS cancellation policy, there will be no refund of the trip fees at that time.\nO.A.R.S. West, Inc. and cooperating agencies act only in the capacity of agent for the participants in all matters relating to transportation and/or all other related travel services, and assume no responsibility however caused for injury, loss or damage to person or property in connection with any service, including but not limited to that resulting directly or indirectly from acts of God, detention, annoyance, delays and expenses arising from quarantine, strikes, theft, pilferage, force majeure, failure of any means of conveyance to arrive or depart as scheduled, civil disturbances, government restrictions or regulations, and discrepancies or change in transit over which it has no control. Reasonable changes in itinerary may be made where deemed advisable for the comfort and well being of the participants, including cancellation due to water fluctuation, insufficient bookings (this trip requires a minimum of 4 guests), and other factors. There is risk in whitewater rafting, particularly during high-water conditions. Rafts and kayaks can capsize. You could be swept overboard. Your guide will make every attempt to assist, but you must be strong and agile enough to \u201cself-help\u201d and \u201cfloat-it-out\u201d without further endangering yourself or others. We reserve the right not to accept passengers weighing more than 260 pounds or with a waist/chest size exceeding 56 inches. We may decide, at any time, to exclude any person or group for any reason we feel is related to the safety of our trips. We are experienced at accommodating people with various disabilities. Please give us an opportunity to make you feel welcome. We need to discuss any special requirements ahead of time. On advancement of deposit the depositor agrees to be bound by the above recited terms and conditions. Prices subject to change without notice.",

    "text": "Kid Hit Menu Items: Thankfully, just about everything. Especially since during the drive over to Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, the toddler\u2019s demands for French fries were getting tiresome. And a little bit worrisome, given that we were already \u201cpot committed\u201d \u2014 as one would say in poker parlance \u2014 to the DTF plan. Well, nary a peep about FFs was uttered once the steamers arrived containing the famous Juicy Pork Dumplings that weep with deliciousness. Eggy fluffy fried rice with slabs of chicken was also excitedly devoured, along with sweet, nutty string beans. Bowls of sesame noodles, which contain endless, messy slurping fun, are a good hearty counterpoint to the delicate dumplings \u2014 that\u2019s if nut allergies aren\u2019t an issue since they have peanuts.\nAdult Perks: DTF is an alcohol free zone. But we never give any thought to this prohibition, at all. We\u2019re too busy ordering as much as we can possibly eat to notice or care.\nPros: Incredible Shanghai style soup dumplings that attract massive crowds. Service is fast and efficient once you\u2019ve been seated. It\u2019s a well-oiled machine, that Din Tai Fung. They\u2019ll give you a nice kid/baby place setting with a paper cup and plastic utensils; the baby used them as toys rather than eating implements.\nCons: See above. The quality + popularity = long waits. If you\u2019re chronically behind schedule like we are, then plan peak dinner times VERY carefully. Arriving at say, 6:30 on a Sunday isn\u2019t ideal, unless you want to spend a total of three hours for a meal during which sitting and eating inside the restaurant accounts for maybe 45 minutes. There\u2019s also a second location nearby, but we stick to the O.G.\nChanging Station: No, but an amazingly clean bathroom which, if the janitorial log is to believed, gets checked about every 15 minutes.\nAt least there are some ridiculously entertaining ways to pass those long wait times.\nParking and Access: Busy strip mall, but there are always spaces. Chances are someone in your party will have to hop out to grab your number and get on the list anyway, so that gives you time to circle around. Def not easy stroller navigation territory once inside.\nOther Tidbits: My first visit to DTF was when I was super preggo with #1. The wait was tough, but man, just talk to anyone who\u2019s been, and you\u2019ll hear endless praise about the transcendent soup dumpling experience. Now the waiting is still the hardest part, especially with kids. But if you get it together early it\u2019s do-able. Or as we discovered this week, the strip mall has plenty of diversions to pass the waiting time (an hour this past Sunday). The random shop next door has a bunch of those hook-your-prize arcade machine thingies, including one with a Louis Vuitton tote, proof of authenticity certificate and receipt included. Adjacent bakeries and other food businesses can help out in a pinch, too.\nSo when I heard these words, my heart leapt and I felt a crazy parenting high: \u201cI want the last soup dumpling!\u201d The lapse in manners notwithstanding, we could not have been more thrilled. Next time we\u2019ll get an extra order, and arrive by 5.\nActually, skip the original Arcadia location and go to the relatively newer one next door instead.\nExtra suggestion: Alternately, dumplings can be ordered FROZEN six hours in advance, and steamed at home. Our friends have organized groups of us \u2014 many of whom have kids \u2014 to pitch in on a massive to-go order from DTF. Henry and I once brought a case of sodas and beer from the beloved Galco\u2019s to go with. Behold the spread (at right). The steaming requires a little work, but so worth it to enjoy the wonders that are Shanghai soup dumplings in the comfort of your own home.\nHours: Monday \u2013 Friday, 11 a.m. \u2013 3 p.m., 5 p.m. \u2013 9:30 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. \u2013 9:30 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m. \u2013 9 p.m.\nNext post: Hold the knuckle from that sandwich, please!",

    "text": "$100 on lawn maintenance every month?\nWe are spending $100 on lawn maintenance. Cutting and fertilizing. I know I can save $50 by mowing my own lawn. What should I do about the fertilizing part?\nCan we do this ourselves? I know there is a lot if chemicals involved is it worth it? Any suggestion from DIYers out there?\nI don't use any chemicals on my lawn. Of course, it's not golf course-quality, but it's a lawn. I use corn gluten meal and I plan to aerate in the fall. If you want a nicer lawn and want to be a little more diligent about it, get this book: http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Lawn-Care-Manual-Low-Maintenance/dp/1580176496/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1336016190&sr=8-2 He has a good month-by-month guide to lawn care. It certainly should cost less than $50 a month most months. Also, it's kind of comforting to know you hire someone to mow the lawn. I often wonder how people like you get it all done in the same 24-hour day that I live. You seem to have a lot of projects and jobs going all the time.\nHi Steve, Thanks for responding. I'd love to spend less than 100 on the lawn but need to make sure HOA doesn't come after me. Another thing I learnt is to focus on the most important things in life. I'd rather spend an hour with my girls than mow the lawn. I am hanging in there Steve, it's been quite a challenge but I keep the focus. I'll check out the book for sure. Thanks for the link.\nYamini, I just got sprecticide that you hook up to a hose and will killl 250 kinds of weeds and covers 5000 sq. ft. Cost, inculding water - under $11.00. Guaranteed to last 6 months. I just used it, and will let you know results. Maybe you can use something like that and just have them mow. It could save you a little money, while still having time with your girls.\nTerri, Thanks so much for the suggestion. What is this product called. I'd like to try it for sure. It will not only save me time but also money. Yay I love that!!!\nYamini, check out Walter Reeves' website for compreheisive advice on products and timing for various types of lawns. I follow his suggestions religiously. Have tried lawn services in the past for the fertilizer/weed control, but have much better success doing it ourselves.\nYay! that gives me hope. Yes I will start following Walter and his advice on lawns.\nYamini, I mispelled it - Spectricide Weed Killler - got it at Lowes and am noticity alot of weeds starting to die this afternoon.\nYanini, a few days filled w/ lots of rain has gone by. Dandilions and many other weeds have died. No sign of new one's growing. However, there is one pest that doesn't appear to be dying yet. I was told to give it a couple of weeks to really hit the root system. If it doesn't die, then I am taking it to Lowe's with me. Over all, I would say a 90% success rate so far.\nMy DH says no fertilizer no mow so we fertilize spring and fall and mow 3 inches high about once a week but not as much July and August. We also never water our lawn either.\nIf it were me, I would plant flowers, especially natives that take care of themsleves. Personally, I find nothing but green grass boring, no texture, color. But that is me. I like my bees, butterflies darting about the yard.",

That is why we need this festival.We need a forum for people to come together and communicate. Through this festival, we will share with the world what Fukushima is going through now, and what it will be in the future. We are determined to change FUKUSHIMA! into a positive word.\nThe flag of Project FUKUSHIMA was raised by three joint representatives, Michiro Endo, Otomo Yoshihide, and Ryoichi Wago, right after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 from desperate desire to tell the world what was happening then, and to give FUKUSHIMA, a name suddenly notorious from the nuclear power point accident, a better and positive image filled with hope for the future. The first goal was to host a festival right inside the city in August.\nWe have carried on our mission year by year since then, not only in the heart of Fukushima city, but also in various places in Japan and even globally. It is our belief that such action leads to new culture which will raise peoples energy to live this world.\nThe first outdoor music festival, free of charge, was held in August 15th, 2011. A total of 13000 people from Fukushima Prefecture and beyond came to the event, while a total of 250,000 people tuned in to DOMMUNE FUKUSHIMA, the Ustream program aired live on the internet.\nSince then, presenting a Festival, a unique social gathering held inside actual Fukushima, has become our well known main activity.\nHowever, alongside of the consequences of the nuclear power point accident, our challenge is to continuously rethink its content and presentation every year.\nIn year one, an outdoor music festival was held on the outskirts of Fukushima City, with the theme of \"the future with our hands,\" attracting enough people to make our initial dream of 10 thousand people from within and outside of Fukushima come true. Since then, the event has been held every year on August 15th, leading to the creation of an original Bon-Odori song \"Eejanaika Ondo\". We had been exploring the form of the festival and in subsequent years have continued the bon odori festival every summer. The dance does not validate the current conditions. Rather, it is an expression of scathing criticism. Five thousand people dance, sing, and perform music, creating a swelling movement around the tower set up at the venue in Fukushima City as they let their heartfelt emotions intermingle.\n\u2192 see the details of Festival FUKUSHIMA!\nHow do we deal with this new reality in Fukushima? Let's learn from the experts and study on our own together!",

Kleoniki Demiri is a reputable performer of classic cinematic songs, in Greece and abroad. They both join their talents and experiences through the secret landscapes of the cinema, or of what could be the cinema, when the lights of the screen are turned off. On this night, songs from selected international and Greek movies, will escape from their cinematic justification and will emerge into a dreamlike musical performance of great passion, mellow emotions and unfulfilled adolescence love, as well as full of joy, hope and positive contemplation of the future. Scenes from beloved classic movies, moments that define our own life, or what we would like our life to be, music and pictures as a colorful mural, as impressive, mystical and secretly promising, as the narrative of our own story.\nMusic and songs that bring back memories from the past years of our lives, when we were enthralled by the charm of the cinema screens and their projected scenes. Acoustic nostalgia for selected ageless music that once emerged and is still accompanying us. Adaptations from some exquisite and equally unforgettable theatrical performances. We are very excited to present to you this mosaic, made of pure musical emotions, where the old coexists with the new and all of what is Greek blends harmoniously with anything international.\nNikos Gatsos, the famous poet and writer, is equally established as a leading lyricist of the Greek music scene. His lyrics have appeared and enriched music compositions by Manos Hadjidakis, Mikis Theodorakis, Stavros Xarhakos, Dimos Moutsis, Loukianos Kilaidonis and other. Manos Hadjidakis once said about Nikos Gatsos: \u201cHe wrote unique songs. All the expensive elements of his poetry were turned into lyrics that mobilized our mined modern Greek sensitivity, as the latter remained unconsciously numbed by the lyrical exaggerations of the past, for too long. I was a student of his. I consider him the most important person I have met in my life, after my mother.\"\nA selection of important music Greek compositions that proudly represents the 20th and 21st centuries' artistic movement in Greece. Music written by Rena Kiriakou, Manolis Kalomiris, Giannis Konstantinidis and Manos Hadjidakis, plus pieces written during the period in-between. A program that intelligently combines European-style compositions with traditional melodies and dances of Greece.\nSongs that encompass a major melodic range, from lightweight popular up to works of traditional poetry.

Dimitris Eratinos' album, entitled \"In the Hug of the World\", includes 12 new songs, music and lyrics written by Dimitris Eratinos, Panos Lambridis, Konstantinos Boukouvalas, Stefanos Babalos, Kostis Chalatsis, plus one song written by Phenia Christou (music) and Leonidas Kakaroglou (poetry, lyrics), and one more song, music written by Areti Kokkinou and lyrics by Maria Polidouri.

    "text": "Established in 1996 with an in-house casual wear brand named \u201cWrecker\u201d for both women and men with just 20 machines that used to do outsourcing for washing, the Noida-based company has come a long way since its inception. The company now has 400 machines for sewing and the latest technology for all processes. With a strong focus on innovation and technology, the group believes that denim is not just a pair that you wear everyday but has a huge scope of creativity as well. Exporting denims to all of Europe, mainly Spain (Mayoral) for the past 15 years and also to Italy, Germany, Denmark and the UK, the company has a 70:30 ratio in domestic use vs export of denims. In India, the company is currently making denim for reputed brands like Being Human, Black Berry (URBAN), RedChief and WestSide (WestSport & Nuon).\nTeam Perfect Sourcing, in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Shailesh Jain, Director of the company lists the details of its journey.\nPS: How has the journey been so far?\nThere have been many ups-and-downs since starting and now with hard work dedication and commitment, we feel that this growth will continue. Now we have more than 400 machines with in-house laundry facilities; washing and designing is also done within our premises.\nDenim is a creative product and the market is also lucrative and growing at a very good speed. People who are making denim for mass markets have grown substantially vis-a-vis those who are making it for standard or premium markets.\nPS: What are the focus products?\nConsumers want best quality denims at reasonable prices, so that\u2019s what we are focussing on now. We are more into fashion and premium products and foresee substantial growth in this segment. Our focus is mainly on denims for men and kids and we feel that the growth can be 20 per cent yearly in this segment. Kids\u2019 wear comprises almost 80 per cent of our total capacity. Very recently we have started with men\u2019s wear brands like Being Human, BlackBerry (URBAN), RedChief and WestSide (WestSport & Nuon) also. Apart from jeans, denim dresses, skirts, shirts and jackets are also well received in all age groups. Jeans is becoming more of a working class culture than a fashion garment.\nPS: What upgradations have been done in technology at your company?\nDenim needs constant innovation and for that, technological upgrades are the need of the hour. We have all facilities in-house. Fabric & trims are what we procure and the rest all is done with in-house facilities including embroidery & all kinds of washing. Cost reduction is possible only by increasing capacities and so presently, we are working on numbers and also making IE (Industrial Engineering) department work more efficiently towards cutting down costs.\nPS: What is the strategy of growth for 2019?\nMore machines, new laundry, compliance facilities, less buyers and more capacity.\nPS: What is the monthly capacity of the company\u2019s manufacturing unit?\nWe have the capacity to produce 1,25,000 pieces monthly with hi-tech machinery and adhering to benchmarked quality standards. The fabrics that we have are denim 3.50 oz. to 14.50 oz., canvas, twill, poplin, voile, cambric, linen, corduroy, yarn dyed, twill lycra, satin lycra in various washes, prints & embroideries. As for denims, we have jeans, jackets, shirts, dresses, skirts, blouses, vests, tops, t-shirts, shorts, bermudas, trousers , capris, overalls, rompers and jumpers.\nPS: Any expansion plans? If yes, by when will it be completed?\nYes we are planning some expansion over the year and one more factory will be coming up in Noida soon. We will be increasing our capacity in sewing and washing and focus on different washing techniques as well. We are focussing on practices and products which are eco-friendly with less water consumption needed in washing or other processes. We plan to start this expansion from June 2019.\nPS: What are the challenges of the denim market and manufacturing today?\nPrice has been the biggest challenge for the denim market today. But in our experience, conversion of basic denim to a high fashion product will bring you out from that challenge.\nPS: What is the general export market scenario prevailing at present?\nAt present exports orders have shrunk in number and it would be less as compared to the past two years. But the market forecast is that it will increase after 2020.\nPS: What measures do you take to grow with sustainability?\nSustainability is very important to any business or else it becomes a risky affair. We have limited ourselves in buyer selection and capacity allocations for individual customers. Increasing business with regular co-partners in addition with 1-2 new partners every year has made our growth sustainable.\nPS: How is your company complied with the concept of Gender Equality?\nGender equality in garment industry is very important. We pay both males and females as per Govt norms and special security is given to all women co-workers so that they feel safe. We are in association with a 3rd party NGO where our workers are in direct touch with them to get advice in case of any sexual harassment by any co-worker and internal team within the organisation. The organisation also takes updates from workers at regular intervals. Right now, the ratio of women to men is 30:70 but we hope to increase the number and make it 40:60 in next two years. We are also associated with an NGO called \u2018Syadwad Yuva Club\u2019, where we are doing free health check up camps, blood donation camps, clothes distribution , education for the poor, food distribution , cleanliness drives and many other activities.\nWhy Is India Not Able To Reach Apparel Export Targets?\nHow this Indian apparel exporter is planning to bolster profits?\nCan West Bengal Be The Next Garment Manufacturing Hub In India?",

    "text": "The year is 2031. Crime is on the rise.\nAll across the world, dozens of seemingly unsolvable murders pop up every day, with no apparent purpose or pattern.\nUntil, that is, someone noticed that renowned mystery novelist Kyle DeMille had written several books with remarkable similarities to a number of the murders.\nShortly after his arrest, however, it became clear that DeMille was not acting alone. As more evidence came to light, and a number of new novels popped up under pseudonyms, the extent of the scheme became clear.\nThere was an entire criminal organization run by murder mystery authors conducting research to learn if their intended crimes were plausible. They called themselves Undercover, and aside from DeMille, their members proved elusive to track down.\nIt was only a matter of months before writing murder mysteries was banned under international treaty. Today, no author who hopes to have a serious career will admit to ever writing one, and publishing companies are cracking down on suspected authors in their ranks.\nIconoclast Publishing was no exception. They were a small publisher with only twenty-one authors under their banner, and they couldn't afford the bad press if they were found to be harboring criminals.\nTonight, Iconoclast was holding a party for all of their authors, and attendance was mandatory.\nNaturally, everyone suspected the real reason for the party was to flush out the Undercover agents. They were right, but they were still in for an unpleasant surprise.\nOnce all the authors were in, someone wondered where the head editor was. A quick check of his office revealed the shocking truth: He was dead, crushed under his own office chair, just like the victim in A Bad Day at the Office. Undercover had struck.\nWorse, the building was locked. The authors were trapped, knowing only that some among them were coldblooded killers who wrote about their crimes.\nAnd so the race was on to find Undercover.\nThis is a Mafia game! Setup was handled by soundlyParanoid and flavor is being handled by me. It's going to be a pretty straightforward game, expect plenty of vanilla roles.\nWe're looking for twenty-one players in total. If you're taking part, we invite you to come up with a name for the author you'll be playing as. Send me a PM with the name so I can plug it into the role flavor (which I'm still writing out, but I expect to be done by Monday at the latest).\n-We may suggest roleplayable quirks for you to follow based on your role flavor. This is optional, but if you keep it up and make it amusing, you may just get a prize! Prizes will be nifty but not necessarily game-changing.\n2. Crowstone - Whimbrel - Rory Ringepinder, playwright, caramel townie, lynched D6.\n19. Gnauga - R.L. Stine - Undercover traitor, one-shot bulletproof, had a variety of win conditions depending on if he were dead or recruited and which factions won the game.\n-None on the waiting list, contact me if you're interested.\n(03-07-2014, 05:56 AM)Dragon Fogel Wrote: \u00bb The authors were trapped, knowing only that some among them were coldblooded killers who wrote about their crimes.\nFogel, how dare you. This is outright libel, it's like you didn't even try to hide it.\nI guess I'll join too, but only in the hopes that I might manage to find the inevitable mod self-insert character and make him answer for his crimes against me.\nPara ordered me to sign up for this.\n(06-03-2014, 03:10 AM)Dragon Fogel Wrote: \u00bb DON'T EDIT POSTS YOU'LL GET MODKILLED wait a minute.\ncan I join? I know nothing about the mafia rules but whatever. Should i write like a profile of author-me???????\n(03-10-2014, 10:28 AM)Dalmationer Wrote: \u00bb can I join? I know nothing about the mafia rules but whatever. Should i write like a profile of author-me???????\nThere's no need for that, just give me a name and I'll give you a brief backstory with your role.\nAlthough if you want to come up with a bunch of crazy stuff to add onto that backstory, well, I've got no problem with that.\nColdblooded has been moved off the player list and onto the replacement list due to being busy.\nI will be Nell M. Frank because all my favourite scifi authors have middle names.\n(03-10-2014, 05:39 PM)Dalmationer Wrote: \u00bb I will be Nell M. Frank because all my favourite scifi authors have middle names.\nI meant to PM me with it, but it doesn't actually matter that much since the name won't determine anything actually relevant to the game.",

RT allows the viral RNA to be transcribed to host DNA and synthesize new DNA composed of the virus\u00d5 genome. Because RT also exhibits RNaseH activity, it enables the production of a DNA/RNA hybrid used for synthesis. Additionally, it can cause errors during transcription, creating difficulties in isolating the virus and promoting further infection.\nImmunogen: Recombinant immuno-deficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV- RT).\nFormulation: Provided as a 0.2\u00b5m sterile-filtered solution in Ca++ & Mg++ free Dulbecco's PBS with 0.08% sodium azide.\nApplications: ELISA: The biotin form of this antibody has been used as solution phase Ab at 2 ug/ml in a two site ELISA with AS34. Typically the ELISA has a working range of 2-500 ng/ml and a sensitivity of <1 ng/ml HIV-RT. Recommended sample volumes are 50-200 ml. Immunoprecipitation: This antibody has been used to immunoprecipitate > 90% HIV-RT in solution using a double-antibody method (Midgley and Hepburn). Immunoprecipitation has also been accomplished using Protein G agarose.\nPositive Control: Specificity: Recognizes an epitope on HIV-RT that is different from AS34 epitope.\nMidgley, AR and Hepburn, MR, Methods Enzymol., 70, 266, 1980.",

    "text": "Wow! I was pleasantly surprised about how many people participated in this Mini and the quality of images all of you have entered!\nSo first of all, thank you for giving us your interpretation of the Mini's topic \"River Life\". It is fascinating to see your approaches, and what the River Life means to you.\nNow for the hard part - so many great entries for sure didn't make it easy for me to pick the winning entries. But first, let's start with some commentary. Apologies that I can't comment on every picture entered - I will try to limit it to the favorite picture from each set.\n@Cavalier Although not clearly at a river, the Egret picture is truly awesome. I love the colors and the reflections, and the egret itself is portraied very well. A very nice composition!\n@JAG My favourite of your entries is the stoned-looking crocodile, relaxing (I hope!) at the shore of the Tarcoles River. La pura vida in Costa Rica!\n@sarasphotos Although yours are not entries, your depiction of the river as recreational area is interesting! I especially like the picture with the men in the boats, it is so action packed and full of expressive emotions. Are they fighting?\n@pegelli Your first picture is a good example of how rivers are embedded into towns (or a town is embedded around a river) and used for all kinds of purposes supporting the life of people in that town.\n@WildernessExclusive I almost missed out your additional two pictures, but I did love the first already. The water has such a fantastic color, and the people seem to have quite a good time. Have you taken this picture from a boat?\n@grandmaR Your fishing Santa Clause (I was thinking ZZ Top!) immediately caught my attention. What a nice catch (I hope the guy had one, too)! But my favourite from your set is the fishermen working with the nets on the river. The light conditions were not ideal, but the moment you captured is a good depiction of how people make a living from the river!\n@DavidRGillespie Oh sweet Canadian wilderness, lets me dream of me some day being there. My favourite of the three is number two, the boat clearing the logs from the bridge area. I'm a little jealous that you have such a wonderful scenery right in front of your door!\n@schmad Wow, that first picture has such a beautiful green overflow, with all the brown branches providing a nice structure and then, boom, a red canoe with a red-dressed guy in it.\n@lkbart I love the display of joy the river gives to these (i suppose young) people in your third picture. \"Somewhere in Vermont\" is the right title for the picture. I can see a little house behind the trees to the left, and my mind tells me the person on the bridge is about to jump into the river anytime right now. Beautiful picture!\n@GSPeP Your Low & Dry picture is a very nice depiction of how dependent people are on nature's will - if the river is dry, you cannot do much with your boats. I love the composition, the mild colors and the muddy, well structured river bed. Well done!\n@StueveShots \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for the day. Teach a man how to fish and you feed him for his whole life.\" - Your second picture strongly supporting this proverb. A very nice moment in time that you have captured there!\n@AceRph While not technically a River picture, I like your third picture very much. It shows how people are dependent upon the water that surrounds them to make a living.\n@Mongoose330 While also not technically a River picture, I love the creativity you put into this picture! I have never thought about using a flash this way, thanks for this inspiration!\n@sapphire73 Your pictures are plainly awesome, but sadly non-entries! I guess the rivers in Masai Mara are not often full of water, but when they are, are such important to the living beings in the area. The first picture is such an awesome display of so much life around the river, left me speechless.\n@Mongoose330 For the most creative picture - the selfie with flash with waterfall as the backdrop. As stated already above, while technically not quite at a river I just love the idea. And there is both, water and life in the picture.\n@GSPeP - Low and dry - For the beautiful composition of an almost dry river bed and how it gives the human's tools (the boats) a mandatory break from whatever they were supposed to be used for.\n@Cavalier - That is one awesome egret picture, the colors and composition with the reflections are fantastic.\n3rd @lkbart - Somewhere in Vermont - this picture has such a great mood to it, it reminds me of my youth. Very well depiction of living at a river!\n2nd @DavidRGillespie - A tug and log boom clearing the Canadian Pacific rail bridge on the Harrison River. An awesome display of hard work a river may be, with a gorgeous backdrop and a bridge. I long to see that place myself one day!\n1st @JAG for the \"stoned\" tico crocodile chilling at the shores of the Tarcoles river. This is such a wonderful picture, beautifully layered with great colors and detail. And on-spot of the subjects that I was looking for.\n@kurzvorzwoelf thank you for a great running challenge. I agree, there were a lot of outstanding images entered and I am humbled that your chose mine as the winning photo! Thank you! Congrats to @DavidRGillespie and @lkbart for being chosen for runners up. Also congrats to the HM and all who entered. So many great images!\nI will think about this and get the next challenge up before tomorrow.\n@kurzvorzwoelf Thank you for the second place and comments,,and congratulations to @JAG for first and @lkbart for third. This was a big set of images, and Wow! there were a lot of great images in the set. I am very honoured to place in such a strong set of images.\nHey it was great competing in my first challenge, this is a great concept and a lot of fun! I look forward to entering in many more. Congrats to all who placed and got honorable mentions, especially @JAG ... I had my suspicions this image may receive top honor right when I first saw it. Great image.\nost missed out your additional two pictures, but I did love the first already. The water has such a fantastic color, and the people seem to have quite a good time. Have you taken this picture from a boat?\nCongratulations Joyce and all of the winners. There were lots of great shots in this mini!\n@kurzvorzwoelf Thanks for running such a great mini and taking the time to make all of your comments. ...that picture of the men in the boats was taken in rural France at a little \"Dorffest\" (village festival). Indeed, the teams compete against each other to see who remains standing the longest. The team whose jouster doesn't land in the water goes on to meet the next team and so on. An interesting combination of strength and balance.\nCongratulations @JAG for the win & @DavidRGillespie for 2nd! & Wow, thanks for 3rd! That shot was on my first digital camera, saw the two guys on the roof of the bridge, grabbed the camera & barely caught the 2nd as he jumped. Great comments @kurzvorzwoelf & a great theme, nice mini!\nCongratulations @JAG for the win & @DavidRGillespie for 2nd and @lkbart for 3rd. And thanks to @kurzvorzwoelf for a very nice mini and all the great comments on all entries!",

It\u2019s also noteworthy that the director is now Takemoto Yasuhiro (whose previous works include FMP! TSR and the majority of Lucky Star) instead of Ishihara Tatsuya.\nHigurashi is also getting a third series, according to animate.TV. No further details available yet.\nAlso, to no one\u2019s surprise (at least not mine), the newest MF Bunko J came with an official announcement that there\u2019ll be a third Zero no Tsukaima series. I didn\u2019t think very highly of the second series, but maybe third time\u2019s the charm.\nContinue Reading \"Random Musings \u2013 Haruhi, Higurashi, and ZnT Sequels Edition\"\nContinue Reading \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai \u2013 11\"\nThe town meeting is called \u2013 what should be done about this Satoko situation?\nContinue Reading \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai \u2013 10\"\nRika can\u2019t find Satoko \u2013 where could she be?

Continued pressure from tourists and bandits in the night doing what they know best in the Wild Wild West to make tourist come in the boats to see the few birds left in the lake.\nJohn Bel Edwards is an American politician and lawyer serving as the 56th Governor of Louisiana since 2016. He was previously the Minority Leader of the Louisiana House of Representatives for two terms.\nLake Martin Louisiana now Posted Keep Out to Public.\nThe commercial operator who was issued the Alcohol permits to sell and consume on a State Lake, State Servitude, Parish Levy Road, State Dam has now excluded the Public to all the land inside the Lake Martin.\nThe clock is ticking and more and more of the Private Lake will be slowly closed down as land owners protect there property and interest in Lake Martin.\nIf the Public wants to help keep the lake open to them , Then Donate to our gofundme.com.\nMany people have told me this is just Louisiana Politics.\nWell this isn\u2019t the Louisiana like that anymore.\nPeople need to ban together and call there Legislators and Governor and let them know you want to save access to Lake Martin and protection against the tourist companies chasing all the nesting birds out of the lake because of all the boat trafficking in the lake.\nWe need the state to step in and build bathrooms and facilities with a understanding that tour boat operators will have to follow rules and regulations with insurance to protect the state and land owners liability and interest in the lake.\nSwamp tour Operators are encourage to give to gofundme.com so we can restore the agreement and put a commission to over see the Lake rules and regulations.\nState of Louisiana Created Lake Martin Louisiana in 1950 by signing a agreement with the private land owners who land circle all of the Land that goes all around the Lake . The Chauffe Family has all the Land from the boat Landing back towards the Lake where it touches Nature Conservatory Land in the Lake. The State used these leases all around Lake Martin to flood there Land to create Lake Martin.\nThe agreement was that the lake would be used for the public and State access into Lake Lepoite making the Game and Fishing Preserve that people come all over the world to see our last natural beauty left in St. Martin Parish and In the State of Louisiana.\nA Commission was formed that was years later decommissioned and the lake was handed to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.\nSince that time Lake Martin Louisiana has been forgotten by The State of Louisiana.\nSince then the Boat Landing has crumbled into a accident waiting to happen and there are commercial operations with alcohol permits and boat tours. The liability has reverted back to the Land owners.\nThe people of St. Martin Parish are convinced that the State of Louisiana has forgotten about Lake Martin Louisiana Located in St. Martin Parish.\nLand owners have given up on local Parish Government and the State of Louisiana to come in and take responsibility for there lack of interest in Lake Martin.\nNow Land owners are forced to block and post there property to escape the liability they were forced to accept. Saying nothing and doing nothing will pave the way to the whole lake being shut down because the liability that tourism put on Lake Martin.\nLake Martin Parish has no help and the local land owners cannot afford the money to hire legal representation to protect the interests for the Public and State access into Lake Lepoite.\nThe commercial operator make a incredible amount of money from Tourism. Why should the Land owners have to pay to fight for public access. Why Should Land owners take all the liability for the commercial activities in the Lake.\nAll the people going to Lake Martin and supporting commercial activities in Lake Martin Should step back and look what is really going on. If you liked Lake Martin ? Then you should take the time and voice your concerns to everyone involved in letting Lake Martin to be closed to the Public access.\nMany of you who love Lake Martin knows someone who wants to make a difference in this world. If you have been blessed with money or influence to the higher powers in the State of Louisiana then take the time to donate or just pick up the phone and call the Governor JOHN BEL EDWARDS and ask him for help.\nHow Does Massage Work ?\nThe relaxation response may decrease the physical effects of stress and reduce the risks associated with stress, such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, anxiety insomnia, persistent fatigue, sexual dysfunction, digestive disorders , and psychological issues\u2013to name a few.\nA Combination Massage is a massage integrating more than one style or massage modality. It can combine techniques from Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, reflexology, trigger point therapy and hot stone.

    "text": "Open to a \"World of Possibilities\"\nI have traveled to many countries including France, Italy, The Netherlands, The UK, Kenya, US, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Japan, Korea, Singapore, UAE, and most recently India. I lived in Japan for 2 1/2 years. So I have experience with all types of people in different circumstances. I enjoy exploring and don't mind being on my own for long periods of time.\nI have been a single mom for 13 years so I am used to maintaining a house on my own, including doing repairs. Now that my kids have grown, I am free to get back to exploring more.\nOver the years, I have rescued 4 dogs and 1 cat. My cat is now 18 but lives with my daughters. When my kids were younger we had guinea pigs, rabbits and hamsters so I have experience with different types of creatures.\nI have been a responsible homeowner for 20 years so I have a different mentality than a \"tenant\". I will respect your home and treat it the way I would treat my own.\nI have been a volunteer in Girl Guides and at my daughters' elementary school as PAC President (Parent Advisory Council), so I have had a criminal record check completed twice in the past. This is required in Canada when working with children and/or handling money - both of which I was involved with in those volunteer positions. I was Treasurer at Girl Guides and I was solely responsible for fundraising over $6,000 for the school.\nUPDATE: I am currently living in Casablanca, Morocco working as an English teacher. I will be available during Christmas break and will check the school schedule for long weekends and post them shortly.\nI have owned a home for the last 20 years while raising my children. Now that they are grown and ready to explore the world on their own, I want to spend some time traveling around and figuring out the next part of my journey. I don't know where I want to settle, or if I want to settle any where. So for now, I am open to all the possibilities the Universe has to offer.\nI have had 4 house-sitting jobs so far in 2018 that included either cats or dogs, along with previous house-sitting posts in animal-free homes. My latest adventure was taking care of 6 dogs - all rescues - in Costa Rica. The posting in my profile says that it was to continue until December of 2018, but the dog owner decided to ship her dogs to her new home in Thailand ahead of schedule in August. This was wonderful for the dogs because they had been separated from their owner & family for 5 months and I'm sure they were happy to be back together.\nDuring that dog/house sit, there were MANY adventures. For example, 2 of the dogs killed a porcupine (never want to go through that again - 2 hours of me & the vet pulling quills out of the anesthetized dogs). 1 dog killed a huge iguana (at least 1 metre) and dropped it on the front terrace for me. I then had to dispose of in the jungle - how lovely!!! 3 of the dogs developed Tick Fever and had to go on antibiotics. 1 dog developed Heart worm and had to go on meds for that. 1 dog became paralyzed from the waist down after jumping out of the back of the car and landing badly (happy ending, I drove him 4 hours to San Jose to a Vet that gave him shots for Sciatica and it fixed the paralysis). At one point, the house was without water for 6 days, along with regular power outages for the entire 5 months. These are just the highlights - LOL. So, after everything I went through with these dogs, I don't think there is too much that I would not be able to handle.\nI am currently living in Casablanca, Morocco working as an English teacher. I will be available during Christmas break and will check the school schedule for long weekends and post them shortly.\nI had to cancel my previous commitment with Linda due to unexpected circumstances.\nShe graciously accepted the rescheduled sit for February ( the Dec. review was supposed to be the Feb. review).\nLinda was fabulous! She loves animals which was very evident upon the first meeting as well as during her sit!\nAll the best, Linda, in your future endeavours!!\nLove from Suki and I.\nLinda was an amazing match for Suki (and myself)!\nShe willingly arrived a day early so that we could become well acquainted with the routine and environment and spend some time getting to know each other.\nLinda kept me apprised of Suki's activities via text and email which I really appreciated.\nLinda left the house neat and tidy before her departure...even left the bread maker ready to go. Thanks Linda!\nI would recommend Linda, and have her back, for a sit any time! Enjoy your future sits, Linda!\nLinda was an amazing house and pet sitter. I had to leave the city in 24 hours and when Linda appeared as a potential sitter, I was so pleased. She is mature and thoughtful. She immediately gained my trust, and was deserving of it. She was quick to understand the apartment and the special needs of the cats, and then while we were away, she sent updates and photos, which was reassuring. And beyond that, she is a lovely person, lively and smart and helpful. I highly recommend her for anyone looking for someone to care for their pets and house.\nWe would be pleased to give Linda Miner a reference! She has house sat our Condo in White Rock several times and has proven to be a very reliable and competent person. She has owned her own home and is familiar with the typical infrastructure of a home/condo etc. When we returned things were as clean, neat and tidy as when we left! She is trustworthy and we had no qualms about leaving her in charge.She has also had both a cat and a dog and knows how to look after them!\nI highly recommend her as a housesitter.",

    "text": "Layers! Our word of the day! They\u2019re a great way to tackle tough projects!\nMy first baby was quiet and mostly self-entertaining. All he wanted was to be near me. And I\u2019m lazy. So when I wasn\u2019t doing something out of the house with him, I sat around goofing off a lot. I eventually came up with a basic chore list, because baby = you need clean dishes and laundry sometimes, and I worked through it. It worked for a few years.\nMy second baby doesn\u2019t let me sit around and goof off. So now that school and jobs have started and I\u2019m his only daytime companion, he provides the final bit of motivation I need to not sit around all day. Still, I have trouble tackling big projects. I\u2019m great at the first 80% of almost any organization or tidying project, which of course only takes about 20% of the time. It\u2019s harder for me to do that last 20%.\nSo these days I work in layers. I use the UFYH of 20 minutes on/10 minutes off (although sometimes I skip the 10 minutes) and I\u2019ve divided my morning up into rooms to work on. Each room gets 20 minutes a day, up to 3x a week for the heavily used rooms. And since the basic tidying I mastered with Robin generally takes no more than 10 minutes, each time I do 20 minutes of work in a room, I dig a bit further below the surface.\nI\u2019m not sure where the journey is going to take me or how long I\u2019ll keep it up. But right now, it\u2019s making a difference. Non-crucial quick little tasks that I\u2019ve procrastinated on for months or years are getting done. Things are getting put away. The exhaust hood over my stove is grime-free for the first time in too long to share. It\u2019s cool.\nI\u2019m on the downward slope in writing Wolf Interval. (I have no idea if that title will stick. I like it but justifying it may be too hard.) I\u2019m going to reach the final scene in two weeks, or three, or four. Probably not more than four, although I\u2019ve given myself six. Which is good, because I have to go back through the book and add in a lot of details. I work in layers there, too. It feels like painting a picture, starting with broad swathes of color over the pencil-strokes of outline, then passing through again to add in depth, background, expression and detail. Honestly it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of writing, because it\u2019s one of the few times when I\u2019m absolutely certain I\u2019m improving the work.\nLayers! They\u2019re how social change happens, too, you know. It\u2019s why it seems like we keep fighting the same old battles over and over again. Things improve each sweep, but there\u2019s an awful lot of grime to scrub away and sometimes you need time away in order to look at the mess with fresh eyes.\nAnyhow, so I gave him one. Then I hid the bag. And I opened my second truffle behind my back. From across the room, he heard the rattle of wrapper and came running. Because I am living in a commercial. What was I supposed to do? I gave him half. And he carefully licked out the filling then offered me the melting shell. Aw. Lindor teaches sharing.",

    "text": "The York College Writing Across the Curriculum requirement legislated by the York College Senate in May, 2001 includes provisions for Writing Enhancement in General Education courses and for Writing Intensive courses in all the disciplines.\n\"All courses included among the College\u2019s General Education requirements will be designated and taught as Writing Enhanced.\"\nIt continues by specifiying that the writing activities and assignments be \"designed to develop students\u2019 competence in reading, critical thinking, and writing.\" Writing enhanced courses not only include writing; they use it as a means to develop thinking and the ability to express thoughts.\nCompleting three Writing Intensive courses is a graduation requirement at York College. The specific number of courses that each student must take depends upon whether the student started at the College as a freshman or entered the College as a transfer student. These courses exemplify the principles of the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) movement by advancing writing skills within the disciplines. A Writing Intensive course is a work-in-progress for the student. It is another way to move the student toward becoming a liberally educated person who can think critically and communicate effectively in a given discipline.\nAll instructors of courses that can be offered in fulfillment of the York College General Education requirement have a responsibility to incorporate informal writing-to-learn exercises and writing assignments-not only to promote the learning of the material, but to develop students\u2019 competencies in analytical reading, critical thinking, and writing.\nA handbook is available to all General Education instructors to share best practices in using writing within the context of General Education courses.\nAn important aim of the WI requirement is to help master the skills needed to write for the curriculum of a particular discipline in the language and style preferred in that field.\n\"For graduation the College will require completion of two designated Writing Intensive (WI) courses in the lower division of the curriculum (at the 100- or 200- level) . . . and one designated WI course in the upper division (at the 300-level or above), within the major discipline design.\"\n\"WI courses are subject-area courses that build on the foundational writing courses (English 125 and Writing 301, 302, or 303) to practice and extend skills in reading, critical thinking, and writing by incorporating guided writing assignments.\"\nThis second provision of the WAC legislation requires students to elect the appropriate number of WI courses, and requires the academic disciplines to define and designate WI courses in sufficient numbers for students to be able to meet the requirement in a timely way. Courses may be designated either on a semester-to-semester basis, or as a permanent part of the curriculum.\nAn emphasis on high-stakes writing assignments (see \"Low- and High-Stakes Writing\" on pages 24-25) also distinguishes WI courses from the Writing Enhanced courses in General Education.\nCurrently, students who entered York College in or after Fall 2003 must complete a minimum of three writing intensive (WI) courses, two in the lower division, and one in the upper division within the major.\nFaculty members and students must understand that there is a distinction between a WI course and a course that is intense because it includes a lot of writing.\nA WI course includes carefully crafted formal writing assignments that are linked to the unfolding of course material. Assignments are not \"add-ons.\"\nFormal writing assignments are guided; that is, assignment sheets are detailed and students receive ongoing feedback and advice on work in progress.\nThe assignments and guidance build on the work of the foundational writing courses to promote a common vocabulary and approach to the writing process; there is an emphasis on critical reading and thinking as well as an insistence on professional preparation of written work.\nThe designated WI courses must meet defined criteria because they are part of a graduation requirement; completion of WI courses is noted formally on each student\u2019s transcript.\nThe criteria for WI courses keep the focus on the process of engaging students in writing activities for the discipline in a way that can lead to improved reading, writing, and thinking skills. These criteria are based on the recommendations of the CUNY-wide Faculty Advisory Committee for WAC.\n\"Formal papers\" means that these assignments usually draw upon reading and/or research and require thought, planning, organization, reflection, and some form of scholarly research. \"Finished pages\" means the standard typed,double-spaced page with one-inch margins. Note: Essay examinations are not formal papers because they do not involve planning and revision. Therefore, essay examinations are not included toward the 10-12 finished pages required in WI courses.\nPapers are assigned in a way that further develops students\u2019 writing competence through a process of drafting and revision, drawing on the learning of the foundational courses, with individual feedback on work in progress.\nThis pedagogical design involves working with each student in a process approach that systematically moves the student toward a final paper. This process is introduced in English 125 and in the Writing 300 courses.\nThe process requires the student to think critically, revise, and edit the paper so that the final submission is closer to the goal of the assignment. In upper-division WI courses, the paper should begin to reflect the dexterity of communication skills needed in graduate school and the workplace.\nSome in-class attention is given to the writing process.\nInformal reading, critical thinking, and writing activities are used during the semester.\ngiving feedback that lets students know where their work has succeeded and where it has fallen short.\nCourse grades are based in significant part on student\u2019s written work. The percentage of the final grade determined by formal writing is, of course, at the instructor\u2019s discretion in the context of each course. A survey of faculty practices indicates that written work, including the process that leads to the final submission, generally accounts for 40% to 60% of the final grade in many WI courses.\nThe special objectives of a WI course are incorporated into the syllabus. Students need to know why a particular course is designated WI and how this affects the coursework. An explanation is needed in class and on the course syllabus. This explanation should include a clear description of the process that an instructor will use to move students toward the final submission and the role preliminary submissions will have in the paper\u2019s ultimate grade, preferably on the course syllabus.\nCourse enrollment is capped at 25 so that student work receives appropriate attention and that the process of writing for the discipline can be adequately addressed.\nWriting to Learn is writing that is closely associated with the learning process as it occurs in class (lecture or discussion) and as it occurs outside of class (reading and assignments). It is the effort to articulate thoughts that move students toward clarity and coherence.",

    "text": "A concert under the direction of maestro Marek Janowski at the Witold Lutos\u0142awski Chain XVI Festival, concerts at the French edition of La Folle Journ\u00e9e and participation in the POLIN Music Festival are just some of Sinfonia Varsovia\u2019s plans for February. The Orchestra\u2019s musicians will also appear in a concert in the Sinfonia Varsovia Chamber Music series. We also have Smykofonia concerts for our youngest listeners.\nThe theme of the 25th edition of the La Folle Journ\u00e9e Festival is \u201cCarnets de voyage\u201d, or Travel Diaries. Sinfonia Varsovia\u2019s musicians will perform no fewer than 11 times during the Festival, accompanying such outstanding soloists as Boris Berezovsky, Nelson Goerner and Rapha\u00ebl S\u00e9v\u00e8re. This year, the programmes of the concerts will consist of music written by composers for whom travelling was an inseparable part of their lives and a valuable source of inspiration. Apart from works by Mozart and Mendelssohn, audiences in France will also hear Sinfonia Varsovia perform works by Chopin and Moniuszko.\nConsidered to be one of the finest conductors of the past one half century, Marek Janowski will conduct Sinfonia Varsovia in a concert during the Witold Lutos\u0142awski Chain XVI Festival. On 9 February in the Concert Studio of Polish Radio we will have an opportunity to hear Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 7 in A major Op.92, coupled with the Concerto for Orchestra, composed by the patron of the Festival. Even though Marek Janowski was born in Warsaw on the eve of World War II, he spent all of his life in Germany. He worked with, among others, the opera in Hamburg and Dortmund, and with the Dresden Philharmonic. In 2002 he took over the position of artistic director of the Radio Symphony Orchestra in Berlin. Tickets are available at polskieradio.bilety24.pl.\nThe second concert in the Sinfonia Varsovia Chamber Music series will take place in the Orchestra\u2019s home three days before this date, on 6 February at 7:00 p.m. This year, the theme of the cycle is \u201cFrom Duet to Octet\u201d, so the second ensemble to appear in terms of size is the trio, made up of Sinfonia Varsovia musicians Celina Kotz (violin) and Jakub Waszczeniuk (trumpet) with a guest appearance by pianist Piotr Spoz. The programme of the concert features music of both Americas, including works by Eric Ewazen, James Stephenson and Astor Piazzolla\u2019s famous Oblivion.\nYou are also invited to attend an identical concert on 11 February at 7:00 p.m. at the S\u0142u\u017cew Centre of Culture.\nAdmission to the concert at 272 Grochowska Street is free. Free entrance tickets for the concert in the S\u0142u\u017cew Centre of Culture are available at www.biletyna.pl.\nSinfonia Varsovia will also perform in the opening concert of the POLIN Music Festival: History Between Sounds (15 February 7:00 p.m.). Conducted by Marzena Diakun, the Orchestra will perform \"Akeda\" by Noam Sheriff, one of Israel\u2019s foremost contemporary composers and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg\u2019s Rhapsody on Moldavian Themes Op. 47 No. 3 (version for violin and orchestra). Works by composers of the youngest generation will be performed after the intermission. Sturdivant Adams\u2019 \"Polin\" is a three-movement musical illustration of the history of Jews in Poland. The work was inspired by the composer\u2019s visit in the Warsaw museum and so the first performance of the work in the venue acquires special meaning. The programme of the concert also includes two works connected with Musical Postcards programme, in which composers send short musical postcards, impressions on their cultures. The first work is \u201cTrip\u201d by Nawras Al Taky, in which the 22 year-old Syrian musicians talks about losing his homeland. The reply to that work is \u201cDom jest gdzie indziej\u201d [Home is Elsewhere] by Mateusz \u015amigasiewicz \u2013 a composition that discusses a constant journey. The soloists will be violinists Linus Roth and Michael Guttman and cellist Jing Zhao. The concert will be conducted by Marzena Diakun. Tickets are available at www.bilety.polin.pl.\nTo our youngest listeners and their parents we recommend family fun at Smykofonia [Toddler Philharmonic] Valentine\u2019s Day concerts. The theme of these concerts on 16 and 17 February is \u201cLa ci darem la mano\u201d, from W. A. Mozart\u2019s famous opera Don Giovanni. We will hear that duet and many other love songs performed by Karolina Maku\u0142a (soprano) and Adam Zaremba (baritone). Accompanying them will be Miros\u0142aw Kulczy\u0144ski (oboe) and Artur Pilch (piano). Tickets are available at www.smykofonia.pl.",

By using dynamic content, Wolters Kluwer can assist in reducing the number of \u201ccustomized\u201d documents historically used by servicers to meet state-specific regulatory guidelines.\nWith each new rule that\u2019s released by regulators, banks face an additional set of compliance challenges that must be met or else, and a new survey from Wolters Kluwer Financial Services shows just how concerned banks are by those new compliance challenges.\nMaybe a rate hike isn\u2019t a big deal. Also, there\u2019s something happening with wages that no one is talking about. And the market capacity for housing? We got that covered, too. If you want to know what\u2019s happening in housing and mortgage finance, this is your stop.\nWith the huge adoption of managed IT services (better known as SaaS or cloud services), an SOC 2 audit provides a definitive statement of security assurance. This warrant is exactly the kind of information that financial institutions need when evaluating managed service providers.\nWolters Kluwer Financial Services acquired a substantial portion of Austin-based Stormwater Research Group, which provides flood compliance solutions to the mortgage banking industry. Wolters Kluwer will expand its presence in the flood determination aspect of mortgage lending with its acquisition of Stormwater, which provides both basic and life-of-loan flood determination services.\nIn advance of the new requirements added to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) that take effect January 1, 2010, the Minneapolis-based Wolters Kluwer Financial Services launched its RESPA Tool Kit to help financial institutions understand and implement the changes. The software provides an overview of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) changes, including revisions to the good faith estimate and HUD-1 and HUD-1A documents, as well as settlement cost booklets intended clarify loan terms to consumers.\nBeginning in August, Wolters Kluwer Financial Services will use several of its technology solutions to test mortgages against the Federal Reserve's new higher-priced mortgage thresholds that will take effect October 1.\nWolters Kluwer Financial Services' new Disclosure Manager Solution will enable institutions to comply with the new Truth-in-Lending Act (Regulation Z) through a single, secure, electronic system, the company said today. On May 8, the Federal Reserve Board finalized its early disclosure rules within Regulation Z, which are meant to ensure consumers receive disclosures explaining the cost of a mortgage earlier in the lending process. Wolters Kluwer says its system offers the first complete solution for automating the entire early disclosure process.",

Our complete house, apartment, and office relocation service combined with our excellent service and rates will make want to move again just to have the experience again. We are experts in our field, and we ensure on time arrival, complete security, unmatched affordability and your complete satisfaction!\nFree online moving quote calculator is light and easy-to-use, not requiring any specific knowledge from you. Everything you need is to specify the total size of your belongings, starting and ending points of your move, using additional services like packing/unpacking, etc. and send the request. Considering all the data you entered we make the accurate and precise calculation of the cost and delivering time and will provide you the results in 5 minutes. You can see information about other local and long distance moving companies in San Diego in our catalog.\n2 Brothers Moving just made my month!They were punctual and hard working. They treated my belongings as if they were their own. The couch sectional was too wide for the door, so they lifted it over the patio wall! Talk about coming up with solutions.Would definitely recommend them.\nTwo Brothers Movers moved my best friend over a year ago. They were awesome! I recommended them to my parents, and they far exceeded our expectations!!! They spent days helping my parents move. They are so kind and take absolute care when moving belongings. They have taken such great care in making sure my parent's belongings get into their new house and that everything was set up and ready to go. My Dad is retired from the military, and in 25+ years of moving, I'm not sure we've had a better moving company! I would HIGHLY recommend them!Edit: Well, we thought all was going well, and then one person from the company set a price; the next day, another person set a higher price. Word of mouth advertising is better than anything else. Why would they mess up a good thing?! Please don't ask for one amount and then up the price $500 the next day. Not good for business!!!\nElmer Lopez and his team did a fascinating job. It has been a pleasure working with 2 Brother Movers. They made it fun to work with them. Any referrals I can help them with, I will send them their way.\nBeware!!! This \"moving\" company showed up over 2 hours late with no notice. I booked 2 movers and only one showed up. Then for the icing on the cake 20 minutes into the move the 1 guy who did show up bailed saying it was to much work! Wtf? Look elsewhere!",

    "text": "David Hume\u2019s views on the subject of free will are among the most influential contributions to this long-disputed topic. Throughout the twentieth century, and into this century, Hume has been widely regarded as having presented the classic defense of the compatibilist position, the view that freedom and responsibility are consistent with determinism. Most of Hume\u2019s core arguments on this issue are found in the sections entitled \u201cOf liberty and necessity,\u201d first presented in Book 2 of A Treatise of Human Nature (1739) and then in his An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748). Although the general position in both these works is much the same, there are some significant points of difference relating to the way in which the core position is presented and also in the specific range of arguments covered. The focus of my concerns in this essay will not, however, lie with the relationship between the Treatise and the first Enquiry versions of \u201cOf liberty and necessity.\u201d My discussion will center on the contrast between two alternative interpretations of Hume\u2019s views on this subject, with particular reference to the version presented in the Treatise. It will be my particular concern to explain and defend the naturalistic as against the classical compatibilist account and to explain the general significance of the naturalistic account for the contemporary debate.\nA Critique Of British Empiricism.Fraser Cowley - 1968 - Macmillan.\nAnalysis Of The Problem Of Perception In British Empiricism.Justus Hartnack - 1950 - Munksgaard.\nOn Hume on Space: Green's Attack, James' Empirical Response.Alexander Klein - 2009 - Journal of the History of Philosophy 47 (3):pp. 415-449.\nEmpiricism and Subjectivity: An Essay on Hume's Theory of Human Nature.

This study investigated the relaxation induced by GSNO and NACysNO in rat aorta and the relation between relaxation and NO formation. Both compounds at concentrations from 10\u22129 M to 10\u22124 M relaxed the rat aorta in a concentration-dependent manner. However, NO production depended on the concentration of nitrosothiols present and was detected only above 100 \u03bcM GSNO or NACysNO. To determine whether K+ channels are involved in the relaxation induced by nitrosothiols, the contractions were induced with KCl at concentrations of 30, 60, or 90 mM. The concentration-effect curves for the relaxation induced by nitrosothiols were shifted to the right for all the K+ concentrations compared with aortas precontracted with phenylephrine. These results indicate the participation of K+ channels in the relaxation induced by GSNO and NACysNO. A selective inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, significantly inhibited the relaxation induced by the nitrosothiols. The relaxation induced by GSNO and NACysNO was inhibited by the K+ channel blockers glibenclamide, selective KATP channels, and apamin, selective for low-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels in rat aorta, but was not inhibited by charybdotoxin, a potent and selective Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker, or by 4-aminopyridine, a voltage-gated K+ channel blocker. These results indicate that relaxation induced by GSNO and NACysNO is partially due to activation of KATP channels and partially due to activation of low-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. However, the ability of the nitrosothiol compounds to overcome the inhibitory effect of high extracellular K+ concentrations suggests another mechanism of relaxation contributing to the nitrosothiol response. The most intriguing finding is that relaxation is not related to the NO produced in rat aorta.\nThis work was supported by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo\u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico, Brasilia, DF, and Pronex, Brasilia, DF.",

    "text": "Afto is full day\u2019s journey (approximately 180 km) southeast of Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa. It is located at GPS coordinates 7\u00b0 27' 20.48\" N, 37\u00b0 59'2.57\" E.\nAfto is in the Hadiya Zone where there is an acute shortage of potable water and electricity. As a result, local residents rely on surface collection ponds, rivers, or shallow hand-pumped wells for domestic water supply, including drinking water. Collection ponds and rivers are polluted from surface run-off. Many shallow wells run out of water during the dry season.\nCan I come and see/check the project myself?\nProject visits are coordinated with SMART. ARS is pleased to forward requests to Director Mulugeta Sedoro. In 2013 Florian and Ramona from MOViEATION coordinated a multiday visit with Mulugeta and stayed in the project\u2019s solar-powered Afto guesthouse. The modest fees charged for guesthouse accommodations support CORE & HUB operations. Click here to view photos from their visit. Click here to view the related 8 minute video. In addition, Florian and Ramona wrote a short letter (in German) about their findings. If you are interested, let us know so we can forward a copy to you.\nIn response to community usage patterns and customer/client requests, in 2012 SMART and ARS technical staff seized the opportunity to design and install solar-powered WASH modules, including Shower, Laundry, and Toilet, each with an integral wetland. The CORE supplies the Shower module with water. Wetland output is used as water input for each subsequent stage/module, thus minimizing demand on the aquifer. The integrated system now installed at the Afto training and demonstration site illustrates effectiveness of water recycling and \u201cwastewater\" elimination.\nSubsequently, ARS's permaculture expert designed a system to utilize the recycled water from the last stage (Toilet module) to water livestock and irrigate high value cash crops on an adjacent two hectares, thus effectively extending the growing season from 3-4 months to 12. In essence, when the interconnected modules are linked to the CORE, the complex becomes a Distributed Services Hub (HUB) which offers a replicable, zero-carbon, zero-direct cost, 21st century water, sanitation and livelihood off-grid solution.\nIn this picture you see the last tank that holds the recycled water from the toilet area. As of our last visit Dec. 2013 we have witnessed that all is technically working. December was just after the end of the rainy season, so local ponds where animal can drink are available. But that will change rapidly. Starting around Feb/Mar this cattle drink system will be filled so that goats, donkeys, horses and even cattle can drink.",

    "text": "Premiums for homebuyers with a down payment of 10% or more and for CMHC\u2019s portfolio insurance and multi-unit insurance products remain unchanged. The changes do not apply to mortgages currently insured by CMHC.\nCMHC is mandated to operate its mortgage loan insurance business on a commercial basis. The premiums and fees it collects and the investment income it earns cover related claims and other expenses while providing a reasonable rate of return on its capital holding target.\nCMHC contributes to the stability of Canada\u2019s housing finance system, including housing markets, by providing qualified Canadians in all parts of the country with access to a range of housing finance options in both good and bad economic times.\nCMHC reviews its premiums on an annual basis and will announce decisions on premiums following this review.\nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) has been Canada's authority on housing for more than 65 years.\nCMHC\u2019s new premium rates will be effective for new mortgage loan insurance requests submitted on or after June 1, 2015. The current mortgage loan insurance premiums will apply for applications submitted to CMHC prior to June 1, 2015, regardless of the closing date. As is normal practice, complete borrower and property details must be submitted to CMHC when requesting mortgage loan insurance.\nThe increase applies to mortgage loan insurance premiums for residential housing of 1 and 2 units for homebuyers with less than a 10% down payment.\nCMHC\u2019s capital holdings reduce Canadian taxpayers\u2019 exposure to the housing market and contribute to the long term stability of the financial system. In August 2014, CMHC increased its capital holding target from 200% to 220% of the minimum OSFI requirements.\nIn 2014, the average CMHC insured loan at 95% loan-to-value was $252,530. Based on this figure, the higher premium will result in an increase of approximately $5 to the monthly mortgage payment for the average Canadian homebuyer. This is not expected to have a material impact on housing markets.\nPremiums in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec are subject to provincial sales tax \u2014 the sales tax cannot be added to the loan amount.",

As you can see the size of the dots created are almost 4-5 times the size of the human hair bulb. The diagram on the picture compares the sizes visually.\n2. COLOR- the color difference in the picture 1 is clearly visible. The dots have over time turned bluish.\n3.

Unfortunately, things this year did not improve, but have deteriorated. Not only that, but now we have official evidence of government cooperation with organized crime. The opposition's abandonment of parliament is without a return, the political crisis is real, but this is an opportunity, a great opportunity, not just to remove a crime-related government, but to give Albanians a democratic, functional system that serves them and not just the political parties or simply the political class,\u201d Basha said.\n[post_content] => TIRANA, April 5 - The Albanian government approved on Thursday an amendment in a previous Council of Ministers ruling that foresaw the state-ownership of the country\u2019s southern coastline so that private investors can eventually build resorts along it.\nThe ruling, dating February 27, was published in the government\u2019s Official Book and was later deleted, also due to pressure from neighboring Greece, as there is Greek minority living in Himara whose properties would be affected under the law.\nOn Thursday, the government approved the law\u2019s suspension only for the part of the coastline starting from Vlora and ending in Saranda - which includes all the locations inhibited by Greek minority landowners.\n\u201cReal estate properties according to Point 1, located in the areas where the initial registration hasn\u2019t concluded, will register under the administrative responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism, after the initial registration process of the private properties located at the cadastral areas included in this ruling has been finalized,\u201d said the ruling approved on Thursday by the Council of Ministers.\nOn Monday, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told the media he\u2019d been informed of \u201cnegative developments\u201d concerning the Greek minority living in Albania, and that, given it was true, it could affect Albania\u2019s EU path, which is also determined by Greece\u2019s support as a EU member state.\nA day later, the CM ruling was deleted from the government\u2019s Official Book, while on Thursday Greek national TV ERT reported Tsipras and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama even had a phone call regarding this particular issue.\nAccording to ERT, Tsipras and Rama spoke about the necessary reforms for Albania\u2019s opening of EU accession talks, however it was also reported the core of the conversation was the draft law which affects the Greek minority\u2019s properties and Tsipras\u2019 ultimatum for it to be amended.\nHowever, the amendment that will allow private property owners to finalize mortgaging processes will not be applied to the other parts of the coastline - a fact which, just as the February 27 ruling itself, has drawn criticism from political experts and international representatives in Albania alike.\nFor over a year, the government has scanned the most profitable areas and on Friday published in its Official Book at least 67 maps with all areas that will guide local units to suspend passing agricultural land ownership to ex-agricultural enterprise benefitors, for those areas prioritized for tourism development.\nThis \u201cstate ownership\u201dof property by law has been criticized from political experts as anti-democratic and worrying, while anonymous sources told Tirana Times the law - and its amendment - did not go unnoticed by a number of ambassadors to Tirana.\n[post_content] => TIRANA, April 5 - Economy expert and analyst Artan Hoxha said on Thursday the solution to the deadlock are early elections that will allow both government and the opposition to compete on an equal ground and that, according to the IPR Marketing survey results published on Wednesday, opposition parties would receive 80 mandates in the present political situation.\n\u201cThey are two eggs which are bumping and one will soon break. As Dr. Noto said, the opposition\u2019s egg is getting stronger,\u201d Hoxha said, referring to Italy\u2019s IPR Marketing Director Antonio Noto, who faced criticism following the publication of the survey.\n\u201cWe have a government intertwined with crime, a judicial power visibly under the government\u2019s rule. Institutionally, it seems like a problem without solution. Just like the vicious circle that comes round and round and cannot stio. There is only one break of this vicious circle and that would be a new electoral process that places the parties under equal conditions of competition, which can come through a transitory government that will do nothing but give a message to criminal gangs, that this model has no future,\u201d Hoxha said during an interview for Ora News.\n\u201cThe question would be this: if the political elections were to take place on April 3, who would you vote for? Opposition parties were at 53 percent, the Socialist Party at 44 percent, while other parties stood at 3 percent, where parties such as the PBDNJ, PDIU are also opposition. So the ratio is at 55-45. If these were translated into parliamentary mandates, the opposition would take 80 mandates and the government 60. So we have a public reversal of the voting inclination inherited from the 2017 elections. The majority in the nation today is a minority and the political minority of 2017 today is the majority in popular support,\u201d Hoxha said.\n[post_content] => TIRANA, April 4 - Italy\u2019s IPR Marketing published its first national survey on Wednesday, where among 2000 voters - only 31.3 percent of whom come from Tirana - 62 percent wish to leave the country.\nAsked whether they\u2019d leave Albania if given the chance, IPR concluded that 62.2 percent of Albanians would leave given the chance, 35.1 percent would stay, and 2.8 percent said they don\u2019t know what they\u2019d do.\nConcerning Prime Minister Edi Rama\u2019s governance, 29.5 percent said they believe the PM is positive, while 34.7 percent gave negative answers. A total of 7.2 percent said they are not able to judge the government\u2019s work.\nFurther on, concerning the criminality in the country - which is a main topic of political discourse and one of the main reasons Albania has still to open accession negotiations with the EU - compared to the last three years, 53.4 percent \u200b\u200bof Albanians think that crime in the country has increased. Few are those who think the opposite, where 17.0 percent think this phenomenon has declined. There are 23.6 percent of Albanians who think the crime is on the same level as three years ago.\nThe survey also touched on the perceptions voters have on the economic progress over the last three years, where 20.9 percent of Albanians think that the economy has improved, while 43.3 percent think that the Albanian economy has deteriorated. Meanwhile, 34.7 percent of citizens think that the economy hasn\u2019t moved in three years.\nIn addition, 60.1 percent of the population listed unemployment as the most pressing problem seeking solution, whereas 53.2 percent believe corruption is most pressing and 45.4 percent regard poverty as Albania\u2019s biggest problem.\nInterestingly, 49 percent of those surveyed said they believe Albania is not heading in the right direction, 40.8 percent expressed an opposing view and only 10.2 percent they don\u2019t have an answer to this question.\nCompared to three years ago, 18.5 percent of the surveyed said Albania\u2019s living standard has risen, while 39.7 percent believe its living standards have deteriorated. Meanwhile, 40.5 percent said the living standard has remained the same.\nIPR Marketing, one of the leading companies in Italy, specializes in research, studies and analysis of public opinion and market for more than 26 years, with successful international experience.\n\u201cWe are used to attacks from all over the world. Because they see us as wizards, but we are not, we do a scientific job, not magic. Surveys are attacked by the loser and this is not only in Albania but everywhere. But over the years, confidence in surveys has grown,\u201d head of the IPR Antonio Noto said.\n[post_content] => TIRANA, April 4 - Albania\u2019s opposition held on Wednesday its eighth protest, which kicked off in front of the parliament and ended close to the government building.\nMeanwhile, inside the parliament, most people were involved in debates with opposition representatives on the electoral reform, following the decision to postpone the Reform Committee for one more month waiting for the Democratic Party and the Socialist Movement for Integration to accept the invitation to conclude this process, which is also one of the recommendations of the European Council to open accession talks with Albania.\nThis time around, the majority of protesters came from DP and SMI youth forums, while there were many who held slogans reading the word \u201cGO,\u201d addressed to Prime Minister Edi Rama. Even among youth, moments of tension were present when a group of protesters tried several times to break the police line at the parliament\u2019s entrance.\nProtesters then moved to the boulevard while holding a paper pyramid, at the top of which was Rama\u2019s name, symbolizing the pyramid of crime and corruption which, according to the opposition, is headed by the Socialist government.\nClose to the government building, the pyramid was set in flames while the protest concluded with the return of the opposition leaders to the DP headquarters\u2019 yard.\nMembers of parliament who refused to resign their parliamentary mandates and others who have replaced their opposition MP colleagues ever since they decided to boycott the parliament, debated the majority over the electoral reform.\nThe debates were prompted by yesterday's Socialist Democrat Damian Gjiknuri's proposal to postpone the Reform Commission for a month, in order to allow the opposition parties to join this process.\nAccording to MP Rudina Hajdari, who is one of the few DP MPs who refused to resign their parliamentary mandates, said the majority should establish a dialogue with the opposition MPs now present in the parliamentary hall.\n\u201cThis commission was established with the previous MPs. We don\u2019t know what you discussed with them, what their proposals were and what they want to achieve with this electoral reform. This is a new parliament and you have to accept this reality. You have to accept new proposals. You have to accept the mandates of that commission expired on February 21, 2019,\u201d Hajdari said, referring to the date the opposition decided to resign its parliamentary mandates and continue protesting to demand Rama\u2019s resignation and the establishment of a caretaker government that can bring about early elections.\nRama, on his part, explained the majority\u2019s proposal to postpone the reform commission is merely a sign of a good will to conclude the only process which remains open with the opposition, pointing out however they will not wait indefinitely, while reminding it was the DP that insisted to Include the Electoral Reform on the European Council\u2019s recommendations for opening accession talks with Albania in June.\n\u201cWe will wait as long as it is permissible. If, on the part of the European Union and the European Commission it is made known the electoral law can stop here, before a decision to open the negotiations is reached, because it is written in the text, we will stop here and refer only to OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, excluding other elements,\u201d Rama said in parliament.\nDespite the recommendation from the EP, the decision on whether aspirant countries will open accession negotiations remains to the member states.\nIn this context, Albania\u2019s political situation does not help the country receive a positive decision, while the results of the European elections will also be decisive in the position that the member states will take.\n[post_content] => TIRANA, April 3 - Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires of the US Embassy to Tirana Leyla Moses-Ones announced on Tuesday that help towards the High Judicial Council will soon lead to the creation of the Court against Corruption and Organized Crime.\nShe said that whoever thinks the ongoing justice reform will fall behind is mistaken, echoing her own words during the AIIS conference \u201c70 years of NATO, 10 years of Albanian membership\u201d which took place on March 21.\n\u201cThis is but one example of how the United States continues to work hand-in-hand with Albanian and European partners to help Albania with Euro-Atlantic integration and rule-of-law. \u00a0We are seeing this in justice reform efforts. The High Prosecutorial Council will soon bring about the prosecutors of the SPAK, and then the National Bureau of Investigation,\u201d Moses-Ones said.\nFurther on, she added that it\u2019ll be US assistance towards the HJC which will finally lead to the creation of the Court against Corruption and Organized Crime.\n\u201cOur assistance to the High Judicial Council will soon lead to the Anti-corruption and organized crime court. \u00a0U.S. Department of Justice officials are mentoring Albanian prosecutors, who are already bringing about notable prosecutions \u2014 and we expect more. \u00a0The United States supports all of Albania\u2019s new institutions, such as the Councils and the SPAK, as well as existing institutions that are willing to fight against corruption or organized crime. Justice reform is moving forward, and it won\u2019t be stopped,\u201d Moses-Ones concluded.\nThe US Embassy\u2019s Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires made these remarks during the ASP Case Management System Upgrade Inauguration organized by the Ministry of Interior.\nValuing the opportunity to mark an important milestone in the modernization of the State Police, Moses-Ones said she is proud to celebrate the continuous close partnership between the state police and the US government.\nMoses-Ones\u2019 words were echoed by the German Ambassador to Tirana Susanne Sch\u00fctz in an interview for the local media Monitor a few days back.\nSch\u00fctz said the country\u2019s ongoing justice reform and its vetting process are successful and have contributed positively in improving Albania\u2019s image in the eyes of foreign investors.",

    "text": "The main objective of CSO business project is to introduce into the market the innovative MD-SD-OCT, a new ophthalmology instrument, which is able to detect, with a single tool, a range of optical pathologies wider than the state of the art technologies are capable to support, with higher performances and significant reduction of manufacturing cost. This target has been reached through the integration of traditional topography approach (Placido's disk) and innovative patented Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (ref. WO 2014/155286 A1), into a single, compact and flexible diagnosis device, real breakthrough for the market at the state of art. As a results of the technology innovation proposed and due to the usage of a less expensive technology invented by CSO (new SD-OCT management system, covered by international patent), the overall cost of the device is significantly lower than the existing applicable technology (about 40% less). CSO - with higher performance, significantly lower cost and new double technology MD-SD-OCT - will be able to improve its competitiveness in the market of ophthalmology diagnosis devices.\nDesign and monitoring of specialized contact lenses.\nDuring the first year of the project, all the technical issues related to the existing prototype have been solved and TRL #7 has been reached while EC type-examination activities are running in order to get to #8.\nFive prototype\u2019s evolutions have been realized and tested with excellent results.\nThe small-scale production of the first 15 items to be validated in operational environment is started.\nTECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENT: represent a benefit in terms of competitiveness for the end user. The technology at the state of the art, is not able to provide the integration of two different diagnosis systems.\nPRICE: significantly lower price. The customer will pay less, for an higher performance device.\nPERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT, in terms of image resolution, measurability of all the are covered by the diagnostic device and in terms of accuracy of the output, thanks to the new patented SD-OCT technology.\nRELIABILITY of the medical result: it will allow detecting pathologies in an early state and, at the same time, avoiding false detection.\nCataract is the process of progressive loss of the lens transparency. This process, linked to phenomena of oxidation of the proteins that form the lens, is the result of a biochemical phenomenon that occurs with increasing age. The increase in life expectancy has already led to an increase in the number of cases, so that today the intervention of cataract removal is one of the most performed in hospitals all over the world. It consists of the removal of the opaque crystalline and the implementation of an artificial lens. MS-39 can be useful to evaluate opacification of the lens and above all to calculate the power of an artificial lens best suited to the patient according to his needs and to the shape of the structures of his eye.\nGlaucoma is an important disease because it can cause irreversible damage if not detected in time, and, if not treated properly, can cause serious damage to the eye or even low vision and blindness. Among the risk factors of glaucoma are anterior chamber narrow angle. The device can capture and measure the irido-corneal angles and assess this risk.\nCorneal transplant is an operation aimed at all diseases of the cornea that reduce visual acuity or opacity of the tissue (post-infectious or post-traumatic scars, corneal dystrophies or degeneration) or its distortion (keratoconus, trauma). The operation involves replacing the damaged tissue with a donor cornea.\nThe new corneal flap, which restores the transparency of the cornea, allows the patient to recover vision. The high resolution of the images of the anterior segment sections allows to assess with a certain facility the outcome of a corneal transplant and to carry out measures for the evaluation of the optical quality after surgery. The ability to measure very accurately the anterior corneal surface makes it an important instrument for planning refractive surgery, to correct defects of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism.\nThis project has receveid funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 673447.\nThis page reflects only the author's view.

    "text": "E-Estonia : How did they do it?\nEstonia is probably the only country in the world where 99% of the public services are available online 24/7. E-services are only impossible for marriages, divorces and real-estate transactions, you still have to get out of the house for those.\nThe population of Estonia is 1.3 million & Australia has around 25 million, the United States 326 million, and China 1.38 billion (ZDNet). Estonia is not a developing country, either, with IT accounting for 7% of its GDP and agriculture less than 1%. Although it is a young country.\nEstonia has been a pioneer in converting public services into flexible e-solutions for its citizens. The implementation of the Government Cloud solution provides an excellent platform for public e-services.This makes Estonia the most digital country in the world.\nHow did Estonia do it?\nThe Estonian Government Cloud has lead to the modernization of existing information systems. Estonia has embraced the opportunities offered by cloud technology to allow more agility in provision of e-services by the government agencies and critical service providers to residents and e-residents.\nGovernment digitisation started in the \u201990s, and by the year 2000, its first digital service was set up.\nEstonia first introduced e-tax declaration, offering an innovative way of doing taxes that the citizens were keen to adopt. And that was the idea: Introducing a better way of performing something that was hectic, rather than digital for digital\u2019s sake.\nIt only takes three minutes to do taxes in Estonia. The country is now moving to full automation, where companies don\u2019t actually need to declare tax at all, as the information such as, salary payments is automatically sent to the government.\nSince the concept was introduced in 2002, 98% of Estonians own an ID card, which is the key to using all the digital services. In Estonia, when a person is born, they\u2019re assigned a personal ID code, it\u2019s mandatory to have one.\nThere is no data kept on the Estonian ID card. It\u2019s a PKI system, where users authenticate themselves with PIN one and seal the deal with PIN two. There\u2019s a public key and a private key on the microchip, but no data.\nThis is how citizens access all of the services.\nLearn from Ingmar Vali, eGovernment Expert Centre Of Registrars & Information Systems, ESTONIAN GOVERNMENT at the Public Sector Digital Transformation Conference, 19th & 20th February 2019, Canberra.\nWatch Ingmar Vali at the ECRF Gibraltar 2018, Don\u2019t miss him in Canberra.",

The subjects willingly abandoned their usual appearance in favor of poses that emphasize the strange and uncomfortable. Volta captured more than 600 photos and will reveal 300 of them as part of tonight\u2019s exhibit. Each photo is 18\u201dx18\u201d and all 300 are mounted together and will cover the outside of the Magnificat Caf\u00e9. This public art project should garner plenty of curious onlookers and will serve as one of the focal points of tonight\u2019s Hispanic Art Walk.\nYou can find more event information on Volta's \u01dd\u026f embellished facebook page.",

(CBS/WJTV/AP) Three members of the University of Southern Mississippi football team who were shot during an altercation at an off-campus nightclub early Sunday morning reportedly apologized to their coach for \"letting the team down.\"\nLinebackers Martez Smith, 22, and Tim Green, 21, and defensive lineman Deddrick Jones, 23, were shot around 1:30 a.m. Sunday after a fight broke out in Remington's Hunt Club and spilled into the club's parking lot, according to Hattiesburg police.\nSouthern Mississippi coach Larry Fedora declined to discuss details Monday after visiting with the players who all remain hospitalized in fair condition. Smith and Jones apparently spoke to Fedora, but the coach says Green wrote his message because he was unable to speak due to his injuries.\nNo arrests have been made and police have not released any possible suspects; however, Hattiesburg police spokesman Sgt. Allen Murray said the shooting was possibly gang related.\n\"We will do all we can to assist these young men and their families, as well as assist the Hattiesburg Police Department in its investigation of this event,\" said University of Southern Mississippi President Martha Saunders, according to CBS affiliate WJTV.\nSmith, a fifth-year senior interdisciplinary studies major, was the team's starting middle linebacker before a season-ending knee injury last month. Jones, a junior from Bastrop, La., has started all 10 games on the defensive line, making 26 tackles this season. Green has made four tackles in the seven games he has played this season and he too is a junior interdisciplinary studies major.\n\"During this difficult time our thoughts and prayers are with these three members of our Southern Miss family, Martez, Tim and Deddrick, as well as their families,\" Fedora said in a statement released by the school. \"These three men are an integral part of the success of our football program and we will continue to keep them in our hearts and hope for a speedy recovery.\"\nIndividuals with information are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 601.582.STOP or 601.582.7867.

    "text": "The majority of species and cultivars can be propagated from cuttings or offsets, however all can be easily grown from seed. Just be aware that selected cultivars and hybrids will not grow true to the parent plants.\nAll Mammillaria seeds are small; in fact they will seldom exceed 1 m in diameter or length. So to make sowing easier use a toothpick with the tip moistened to lift each seed and set it in place on the compost. For very fine seed mix well in with some fine, dry, silver sand, and sow the seed/sand mix across the surface of the compost.\nUsing a good quality cactus compost, fill suitable pots, pan or a modular seed tray to 1-2 cm from the top of the pot. If proprietary composts are not available then you can consider creating your own mix using 1 part of loam based compost (John Innes No 3), 1 part washed, sharp sand and 1 part of fine vermiculite. Mix thoroughly and then put through a 5mm sieve.\nGood quality proprietary composts should all have been heat treated prior to packing to ensure the product is sterile. If you are keen to maintain sterile condition, and even then only using only plastic products, place the filled pots into a tray and carefully add boiling hot water to the compost until the water reaches to just below the rim of the pots. Leave to stand until the compost in the pot has become soaked through. Avoid boiling plastic pots as they can become misshapen, instead clean with a bleach solution before rinsing thoroughly. Previously used terracotta pots can be boiled, but only by starting off in cool to warm water before heating up. Adding terracotta pots directly in to boiling water can cause them to crack.\nOnce cooled, the seeds can be sown sparsely onto the surface of the compost and then pressed into the surface. Do not bury the seed. Add a thin layer of vermiculite to the surface of the compost to help prevent the seeds from moving when watered. Water gently in and continue to keep the water moist throughout the germination process. Never allow the compost to become waterlogged. Tap water is preferable to rainwater.\nMove the pots or trays to a heated propagator and maintain a temperature of between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. With fresh seed you can expect a germination rate of between 40-50% with the first seedlings emerging after 5-7 days, and then with the rest appearing after 4 weeks. Older seeds will have a lower rate of germination and can take up to a month before they start to emerge.\nUnlit they are about 3mm wide the seedlings will be just featureless green globules, but after after a month the first signs of spines will appear at the top. pricking out should not be attempted until at least a year has passed. By thus time the seedlings will be robust enough to withstand handling without too much risk of root damage. When replanting take care to ensure that the soil level is not higher than it was in its original container.",

    "text": "But, what is noticeable in the survey is, while articles rank number one on the type of content that publishers want to see, numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 on the list are different varieties of content. Can you see them on the infographic above? The content variety that makes up 64% of the survey results are infographics, mixed-media pieces, data visualizations, images, videos and interactive maps. These all fall under the category of visualized content. That\u2019s what most publishers want to see.\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced, here is another latest data that might convince you to change they way you do your content marketing.\nHave you heard of Pinterest? Of course! It is one of the popular social media sites whose main appeal is the way it works as a digital bulletin board where users can \u201cpin\u201d and share images of things they like, from food and recipes to clothing and shoes. They\u2019re so popular not just to users but to investors that they are biggest pre-IPO companies that has an $11 billion valuation.\nA recent survey by Millward Brown, visualized by BI Intelligence , shows that 32% of active Pinterest users have bought something in a store after seeing it on Pinterest, while more than half of the respondents said Pinterest helps them find products they want to buy. Three-fourths of them said they had visited a retailer or a website after browsing Pinterest. Boom!\n1. Content marketing should be part of your SEO strategy.\n2. Content marketing should not be limited to articles alone \u2013 use visualized content.\nWhat specific steps can you take after reading this? Just one thing for me. What I did with the marketing team of one client was, after planning out the SEO strategy where a major part of which is content marketing, decide to hire a full-time professional graphic artist. And, the next thing I would be pitching to is getting a video specialist on board to widen the variety of the content we produce.\nFor your own SEO practice, this may mean outsourcing your graphic content to someone else. For others it may be similar to what we did \u2013 hire a graphics person full-time. How you apply this is up to you. Just make sure to use visualized content as part of your content marketing and SEO strategy.\nNext PostHow Will Google\u2019s Buy Button Affect Mobile SEO?",

    "text": "Convincing evidence from numerous studies indicates that carbohydrate feeding during exercise of about 45 minutes or longer (Jeukendrup 2004, 2008; Jeukendrup et al. 1997) can improve endurance capacity and performance. Studies have also addressed questions of which carbohydrates are most effective, what feeding schedule is the most effective, and what amount of carbohydrate to consume is optimal. Other studies have looked at factors that could possibly influence the oxidation of ingested carbohydrate, such as muscle glycogen levels, diet, and exercise intensity. Mechanisms by which carbohydrate feeding during exercise may improve endurance performance include the following.\nMaintaining blood glucose and high levels of carbohydrate oxidation. Coyle et al. (1986) demonstrated that carbohydrate feeding during exercise at 70% of V.O2max prevents the drop in blood glucose that was observed when water (placebo) was ingested. In the placebo trials, the glucose concentration started to drop after 1 hour of exercise and reached extremely low concentrations (2.5 mmol/L) at exhaustion after 3 hours. With carbohydrate feeding, glucose concentrations were maintained above 3 mmol/L, and subjects continued to exercise for 4 hours at the same intensity. Total-carbohydrate oxidation rates followed a similar pattern. A drop in carbohydrate oxidation occurred after about 1.5 hours of exercise with placebo, and high rates of carbohydrate oxidation were maintained with carbohydrate feeding. When subjects ingested only water and exercised to exhaustion, they were able to continue again when glucose was ingested or infused intravenously. These studies showed the importance of plasma glucose as a substrate during exercise.\nGlycogen sparing in the liver and possibly muscle. Carbohydrate feedings during exercise \u201cspare\u201d liver glycogen (Jeukendrup et al. 1999), and Tsintzas and Williams (Tsintzas et al. 1998) discussed a potential muscle glycogen sparing effect. Generally, muscle glycogen sparing is not found during cycling (Jeukendrup et al. 1999), but it may be important during running (Tsintzas et al. 1995).\nPromoting glycogen synthesis during exercise. After intermittent exercise, muscle glycogen concentrations were higher when carbohydrate was ingested than when water was ingested (Yaspelkis et al. 1993). This finding could indicate reduced muscle glycogen breakdown. But the ingested carbohydrate was possibly used to synthesize muscle glycogen during the low-intensity exercise periods (Keizer et al. 1987a).\nAffecting motor skills. Few studies have attempted to study the effect of carbohydrate drinks on motor skills. One such study investigated 13 trained tennis players and observed that when players ingested carbohydrate during a 2-hour training session (Vergauwen et al. 1998), stroke quality improved during the final stages of prolonged play. This effect was most noticeable when the situations required fast running speed, rapid movement, and explosiveness.\nAffecting the central nervous system. Carbohydrate may also have central nervous system effects. Although direct evidence for such an effect is lacking, the brain can sense changes in the composition of the mouth and stomach contents. Evidence, for instance, suggests that taste influences mood and may influence perception of effort. An interesting observation provides support for a central nervous system effect. When a hypoglycemic person bites a candy bar, that person\u2019s symptoms almost immediately decrease, and the person feels better again long before the carbohydrate reaches the systemic circulation and the brain. The central nervous system effect may also explain why some studies report positive effects of carbohydrate during exercise on performance lasting approximately 1 hour (Jeukendrup et al. 1997). During exercise of such short duration, only a small amount of the carbohydrate becomes available as a substrate. Most of the ingested carbohydrate is still in the stomach or intestine. Studies in which athletes rinsed their mouths with carbohydrate (but did not ingest any) during 1-hour time trials showed performance improvements similar to those that occurred when the athletes ingested the carbohydrate (Carter et al. 2004). Others (Pottier et al. 2008) recently confirmed these findings.\nThe typical pattern of exogenous glucose oxidation rates is shown in figure 6.6. The labeled CO2 starts to appear 5 minutes after ingestion of the labeled carbohydrate. During the first 75 to 90 minutes of exercise, exogenous carbohydrate oxidation continues to rise as more and more carbohydrate is emptied from the stomach and absorbed in the intestine. After 75 to 90 minutes a leveling off occurs, and the exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rate reaches its maximum value and does not increase further. Several factors have been suggested to influence exogenous carbohydrate oxidation including feeding schedule, type and amount of carbohydrate ingested, and exercise intensity.",

    "text": "Winter 2014: What are values doing in the village?\nWhat are values doing in the village of Notting Hill and Kensington this winter of 2014? Well, to give some background, 2013 was an unprecedented year for prime London property with double digit price rises recorded in most areas. It was a classic case of demand outstripping supply as swathes of buyers scrambled for limited stock. We expect price growth to be less dramatic in 2014 as more properties come to the market ahead of anticipated tightening of planning and tax policies.\nPotential amendments in planning policy regarding basement excavation is likely to encourage homeowners to obtain planning consent before the policy changes; giving them the option to sell their houses with planning consent in place. Additionally, George Osborne\u2019s proposed changes in capital gains tax on overseas sellers could spur these vendors on to sell before the new tax comes into force. Any increase in interest rates is likely to be modest and we feel this will only have a marginal impact on the cash-rich prime central London market.\nWhile prime central prices may increase at a slower rate, our North Kensington and Bayswater offices saw tremendous prices rises in 2013, which we expect to continue. The success of the prime markets in 2013 has caused a ripple effect in Kensal Rise and Queens Park, and even as far out as Harlesden. In these areas, vendors are frequently selling properties 5-10% ahead of guide price.\nhttps://www.mountgrangeheritage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-Avenue-kit.jpg 300 450 admin https://www.mountgrangeheritage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mountgrange-heritage-logo.png admin2014-01-07 10:32:582017-01-26 10:12:39Winter 2014: What are values doing in the village?",

    "text": "Alarm went off at 6:30 AM so we were sure not to miss the stomping of the Michigan Wolverines. We were up, organized, and popcorn popped by 7 AM - game time in Hawaii! The early game was a defensive struggle, but then noted Wolverine nemesis Beanie Wells asserted himself to the tune of 50-some yards and a score. Not long afterward, a play action pass netted another 50+ yard score. The rodents snuck by us once to produce a 14-7 halftime score. But they came to recognize their superiors as OSU slapped them silly with 28 second half points for a final of 42-7. It was the third largest win by OSU in the rivalry's history. With that pleasant memory firmly placed, we lugged our stuff to the car and said goodbye to Hawaii lodging. We had planned to eat lunch at a stop beloved by locals but it was still closed (it was only 10:30 yet). So we headed to our more important pre-flight appointment, the Kailua Candy Co, for some award-winning chocolates and cheesecake. Next door, we were able to procure some non-dessert food at a non-descript Hawaiian joint called Rainbow Cafe. After lunch and dessert it was off to the Kona Airport. The day was more cloudy and ominous than any day we'd been there, with heavy dark clouds and rain falling on us. I guess it was as good a departure day as we could have had! We jumped on the plane and 5 hours later were in San Francisco. Those 5 hours were not blissful as we sat through a couple of hours of turbulance and near a loud crying 14-month-old kid. I heard that one airline thought about offering baby-free seats but changed their mind. I vote they bring that idea back! Once again, we had an airport dinner and then flew on to San Diego. After getting luggage, car, and driving home, it was after midnight. But we still had to revel a bit longer by watching the college football highlights before heading off to sleep at almost 2. Before sleep we decided to not quite let it end - Sunday was officially part of vacation even though we were home. And so it was -- eating out and resting were at the top of the agenda before we went back to work on Monday. Thus ends our vacation report. I hope you all were able to escape with us to the wonderful and varied beauty of the Big Island. Aloha!",

    "text": "Saint-Omer Wind Orchestra, from Northern France, will be playing a Wind Quintet at St John's College on April, 10 2019 as part of its US tour. 5 French musicians will play an original and varied repertoire to commemorate the long historical ties through the jesuits and honour the relationship between the College and Saint-Omer County.\nThe Orchestre d'Harmonie de Saint-Omer, from Northern France, is now composed of about seventy members, both amateur and professional musicians, mostly coming from the local music academy. As the \"Town band\", it takes an important part in the local cultural life by playing in formal ceremonies or in more festive events and by offering concerts.\nThe Orchestra is also constantly engaged in a reflection to renew its repertoire. It has participated in many creations, worked in connection with \u201ccurrent musical styles\u201d, accompanied famous soloists and took part in many music contests.\nAmong its numerous accomplishments, the Orchestra was rewarded the first prize of the jury and of the audience at the Wind Music Composition competition \"Coups de Vents\" (2015, 2018), and won the Gold Medal of the International Competition of orchestras in Kerkrade (Netherlands) \"Harmony 1\" section (2017). Internationally, it performed in several countries and was invited to play at the Chiayi Music Festival and four other concerts in Taiwan (2016).\nIn the 17th and 18th century, American Catholic families used to send their children to France and particularly to Saint-Omer so that they could study in the College of the Jesuits whose teaching methods were renowned. Among those we could identity Charles, Daniel and John Carroll who later became prominent figures of the American nation.\nSince then, the ties have remained through concrete actions such as educational exchanges between High Schools, internship exchanges and cultural cooperation. Saint Omer Foundation for Transatlantic Values was founded in 2017 with the purpose to highlight this cross-cultural heritage and to strengthen the values of \u201cCulture and Leadership\u201d in the Franco-American relationship while facing the common challenges of our societies today.\nIn Oct. 2017, The Orchestre d'Harmonie (Wind Orchestra) played at the reopening of the Chapel of the Jesuits in Saint-Omer and was subsequently invited by American officials to perform in the USA. Though it started as a local initiative, this US tour is now considered as the first act of the cultural cooperation within the newly-launched Sister States programme between the State of Maryland and the Region Hauts-de-France.\nSt Omer County District gathers the town of St Omer and its surrounding towns and villages. As part of an international promotion strategy, the organization has been very active to strenghen its ties with the USA - especially the State of Maryland - through, for instance, educational exchange and cultural cooperation.",

    "text": "Where do you stay in The City?\nI should first make clear that New York, or more specifically Manhattan, is \u201cThe City.\u201d This is not a statement of arrogance or superiority. It is simply tradition. I grew up in one of the communities that sprang up on Long Island in the first decade after the end of World War II. My parents, like virtually all my friends\u2019 parents and probably all the buyers of the affordable new houses that offered young families their small but tangible piece of the American dream, grew up in apartments in the Bronx, Brooklyn, or Queens. Technically, they were already in New York City, but for them, going to The City was going to Manhattan. My generation inherited this nomenclature. We went to visit my grandparents in the Bronx, but we went to a show in The City.\nFirst time visitors to New York seem to want to stay in or near Times Square. That is the heart of the action. All the Broadway Theatres are within easy walking distance of Times Square. Something like eleven subway lines have stations at or near Times Square. It\u2019s close to the Port Authority bus terminal and to both Grand Central Station and Penn Station.\nBright lights, big city. That\u2019s about all Times Square is to NYC. It\u2019s dirty, crowded and overrun with guys dressed up like Sponge Bob. As an alternative, head a few blocks east for some real culture at the New York Public Library in Bryant Park.\nOf course, I can\u2019t entirely skip Times Square, nor would I want to. As I previously mentioned, there\u2019s something about being in Times Square that gets the heart beating just a little bit faster. While I do not want to stay there, when I started planning my trip, I didn\u2019t have a good idea of where exactly I did want to stay. Since I\u2019m going to the theatre a lot, I wanted to be within either walking distance or an easy subway ride.\nI looked at Airbnb.com and did a search for hotels. I eliminated many options on the basis of price, location, privacy (including not wanting to share the bathroom), comfort, cleanliness, quiet, cancellation policy. Hotels in New York are exorbitantly expensive, and Airbnb rentals are not cheap either. There are bargains to be found on Airbnb, but none of them ticked all my boxes.\nI did a Google search for \u201cbudget boutique hotels nyc\u201d and the first result was for The Quin, on 57th Street at 6th Ave. Rooms there start at $614 per night. That may be in someone\u2019s budget, but it\u2019s not in mine. The second result was for the Hotel Chandler, 31st and Park Ave. Only $371. Only!\nI tried a few other searches and found an article in Travel & Leisure on the best affordable hotels in New York. The first one on the list was The Standard High Line, on West 13th Street, literally straddling the High Line. Starting price: $429. Pass. Next on their list: The Jane, in the Meatpacking District. This place really struck me as the kind of hotel I\u2019d want to stay at, with a truly unique character. And rooms here start at $125. Only that is for rooms with shared bath. Okay for a night, not for a week. Plus the rooms are right next to the West Side Highway, so not exactly quiet. And for rooms with a private bath, the rate skyrockets to $325.\nI could go on and on, but this was pretty much the story wherever I looked. So I made a decision. No, not to throw caution to the wind and book a room at the Four Seasons for $1095. Even if I wanted to stay somewhere luxurious and spend a fortune, I would go for one of those boutique\u2010ish places. But I\u2019m still on a budget. I just decided to crank up the budget slightly.\nAnd so I found and fell in love with the Chelsea Pines Inn.\nIt happens to be the top rated New York hotel on TripAdvisor.\nAn expanded breakfast is set out each morning, and guests can enjoy their first meal of the day while planning out their day\u2019s activities. Breakfast consists of hardboiled eggs; sliced meats, cheeses and olives; homemade bread; New York bagels, croissants and muffins delivered each day; fresh and dried fruits; yogurts; cold cereals and hot oatmeal (in season); juices, espresso, coffee and a selection of teas. Breakfast can be enjoyed in the breakfast lounge, the indoor greenhouse or the flower\u2010filled garden (in season).\nOkay, so it probably won\u2019t be \u201cin season\u201d when I\u2019m there, but that\u2019s okay.\nThe neighborhood is primarily residential, with a mix of tenements, apartment blocks, city housing projects, townhouses, and renovated rowhouses, but its many retail businesses reflect the ethnic and social diversity of the population. The area has a large gay population. Chelsea is also known as the center of the New York art world, with over 200 galleries in the neighborhood.\nI think I will spend at least one day of my trip exploring the neighborhood around the Chelsea Pines Inn. If the weather is good, I can go for a walk on the High Line, which has an entrance on 14th Street at 10th Ave, or head to Hudson River Park. The Chelsea Market is on 9th Ave. between 15th and 16th Streets. And the streets all around are filled with interesting architecture.\nAnd I might check out The Empire Diner, for the architecture as well as the food.\nOh, and how big of a budget\u2010buster is my small room on the 4th or 5th floor of this elevator\u2010less hotel? $249 a night.",

    "text": "If there's one country that might have insight into what a post-ACTA future may look like, it's the Republic of Korea. Korea is known as having one of the most advanced networks in the world, but more recently it has also been the recipient of some of the strongest foreign pressure to ramp up its IP laws. Heesob Nam is a member (and former Chair) of IPLeft, a Korean digital rights activist group founded in 1999 to critique the increasingly maximalist IP rights agenda in that country, and research and present alternative policy proposals. He writes of the impact on Korea of ACTA and other international IP agreements.\nIn August 2008, our group, IPLeft, demanded that the Korean government disclose relevant information about its stance on the negotiation of ACTA. The disclosure was denied, as was our appeal. The reason for the denial was unconvincing: the disclosure, we were told, would result in \"a harmful effect on a diplomatic relationship with foreign countries and severe damage to considerable national interests\".\nHow does the participation in an international cooperation to combat the trade of \"counterfeit and pirated goods\" harmfully impact foreign relationships? Which national interests are to be damaged by open and transparent discussion? Unlike its attitude to civic society and the general public, it turned out that the Korean government already provided relevant information to, and sought opinions from, particular business groups from the earliest stages of the negotiation, at least from November 2007.\nWhen it comes to ACTA, transparency and openness became principles that apply only to a small number of business interests. This is why the secrecy of ACTA is so bad: it mirrors a particular perspective that views the system of intellectual property as a means for maximizing commercial profit and which pays little attention to the broader social, cultural and economic implications of the IP system.\nThis imbalanced and biased approach is infused into the draft texts that we have seen. The draft chapters on civil enforcement, criminal enforcement, and border measures lack procedural justice and fairness. They improperly promote the interests of IP holders to the detriment of the other party in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings.\nThe provisions contained in the proposed Internet Chapter appear to impose undue obligations on ISPs. The extent to which ISPs are to be liable for copyright infringement by users is a matter of domestic cultural policy, not a trade issue. Careful balancing of interests and fine-tuning are necessary, including factors specific to local culture and environment which cannot be concluded in a closed room occupied by trade negotiators.\nMore significantly, the liability of ISPs is of great importance not merely for the protection of copyright: it is important for the protection and realization of everyone\u2019s right to take part in cultural life as declared in legally binding international human rights instruments. One of our concerns about ACTA is the risk of undercutting the principle of the rule of law and the possible conflict with human rights, in particular with the right to a fair trial, the right to equality before courts and tribunals, the right to equality of arms, and the right to be presumed innocent. ACTA tries to introduce substantial changes in civil and criminal procedures. But the proposed changes give rise to issues of procedural justice and fairness, jeopardizing Korea\u2019s obligations under the international human rights instruments, e.g., the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and potentially weakening the democratic values recognized in our Constitution.\nFor instance, pursuant to the US-Japan joint proposal, any provisional measures such as a preliminary injunction may be rendered by judicial authorities without a prior hearing of the alleged infringer. Here, neither \"irreparable harm to the right holder\" nor \"a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed\" is explicitly required. Even the Customs office may take an ex-officio action to suspend the release of suspected copyright or trademark infringing goods. Moreover, right holders may be awarded a predetermined amount of damages without having a burden to show the amount of damage or even when the amount is greater than actual damage. An even more severe breach of principles of procedural justice is found in a so-called \"camcorder provision\" under which anyone who attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to make a copy of any part of an audiovisual work in a theater may be criminally punished. This out-of-proportion rule not only produces a direct conflict with the right to be presumed innocent but also undermines the principle of fair use or fair dealing.\nNational autonomy is vital in order to decide the proper level of local IP protection and enforcement. Korean IP law has undergone substantial revision due to the threat of trade sanctions from both the US and the EU since the early 1980s. This economic coercion has continued for about thirty years, and has led to an emergence of consistent domestic pressure for stronger IP protection.\nInterestingly, the strongest advocates for these reforms in Korea are not the IP industries: they are the executive branches in government which claim competance over the administration of patent, trademark, and copyright. To them, stronger IP protection and enforcement is a chance to enhance their position. The unending economic pressure and the heavy reliance of our domestic economy upon exports have produced this environment. The problem is that these state actors are much more influential than other, emerging local businesses, because they possess institutional capacities and resources to promote a maximalist IP regulatory culture.\nWith this power, these government agencies have introduced new laws in Korea which may well be used to support controversial provisions currently being discussed in Guadalajara, Mexico. Examples include a filtering obligation imposed on certain online service providers, and a \"graduated response\" rule under which the Minister of Culture can suspend or terminate the Internet account of a repeat infringer or even shut down a website that the repeat infringer is using. Advocates claim that the shutting-down provision is incorporated in the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement (and Side Letters) (currently awaiting ratification), and may possibly be pushed by the US in modified form during the ACTA negotiations. If ACTA is concluded with an inspiration of such provisions and applied to Korea under the name of international harmony, our effort to reform the copyright system would be undermined, and opportunities for democratic policy discussion at local level would be lost.\nContrary to the beliefs of ACTA negotiators, stronger, criminal enforcement rules can create unintended consequences among the general public. In Korea, following the introduction of these new laws, reports of criminal copyright infringement skyrocketed from 14,838 to 90,979 between 2005 and 2008. Among these, juveniles victims occupied 24% in 2008, an increase from 1.9% in 2005.\nThis reported increase, however, does not represent a rapid rise of the unauthorized use of copyrighted material by juveniles. Rather, it shows how criminal sanctions can be misused. Under the Korean Copyright Act, any unauthorized acts of reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works can invoke a criminal liability. This wide coverage of criminal sanction paves the way to abuse or misuse of criminal enforcement. ACTA is no different in this sense. In order to be \"willful copyright piracy\" under ACTA, an infringing activity needs to be \"on a commercial scale\". But commercial scale is defined so broadly that it covers activities with \"no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain\". With this broad definition, the infringement on a commercial scale may include almost every unauthorized use of copyrighted work. So, for instance, those who download a single piece of music may risk criminal penalties. In other words, ACTA opens the door to the global misuse of criminal enforcement rules, beyond even what we've seen in Korea.\nHere, criminal sanctions have become a sort of new business model for lawyers acting for copyright holders (mainly music and film industries). They monitor Internet users and send warning letters to suspected individuals threatening a criminal action. In exchange for not taking the criminal action, they ask for a cash settlement. Criminal enforcement procedures provide copyright holders with leverage; using the threat of criminal action as leverage for the settlement negotiation as the initiation of criminal procedure is triggered by a complaint by the right holder. Among the 90,979 complaints in 2008, 56% were settled out of court.\nACTA risks exporting Korea's criminal enforcement regime, while importing the worst of other countries' IP laws. But that's not the only reason to oppose it. A trade agreement that breaches procedural justice, fairness, transparency, and proportionality is not Anti-Counterfeiting: it's Anti-Commons.",

Strand surface roughness and classification,\" BioRes. 10(3), 4599-4612.\nIn this study OSB strands produced by a CAE 6/36 disk flaker from re-saturated moso and guadua bamboo tissue were classified by surface quality and compared with industrial aspen OSB strands. Strands were first classified into three groups based on surface appearance and texture. The topographic features that characterize the surface were then measured using a laser surface profiler to give two surface roughness indicators; average roughness (Ra) and average maximum roughness (Rz). Guadua strand surface quality was extremely poor compared to moso due to its very large, dense vascular bundles. Ra and Rz values for many bamboo strands, particularly guadua, exceeded the typical diameter of resin droplets dispensed during industrial OSB blending, meaning that excessive roughness could compromise bonding efficiency in bamboo OSB.\nIn Part II of this series on stranding moso (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel) and guadua (Guadua angistifolia Kunth) bamboo, the surface quality and roughness indices of strands were assessed. Part I (Semple et al. 2015a) covered strand production using a CAE 6/36 laboratory disk flaker, pole characteristics affecting strand size and quality, and compared frequency distributions for strand width and thickness against a standard industrial aspen OSB mill furnish. To minimize the amount (and cost) of resin required to manufacture OSB, strands are spot-welded together by very small, dispersed droplets of resin (Kamke et al. 1996; Smith 2003a,b). There is very little information available on the measured surface roughness of OSB strands, and none for bamboo strands. Information on how it may affect the efficiency of bonding of small droplet arrays deposited during the resin atomization and blending process is also lacking. The very rough surfaces of many of the bamboo strands observed in Part I may be different to and outside the range of surface roughness found in standard OSB furnish, and potentially reduce the bonding efficiency of very small adhesive droplet arrays.\nThe surface of a machined piece of wood (such as a sliced OSB strand) is a complex function of three levels of texture (Marian et al. 1958): the woods\u2019 own anatomical features (e.g., vessels), intentional machining features (e.g., smooth slicing by a planer or roughening from sand paper), and errors of form (e.g., material distortion and variability in tooling and machine performance that produces \u2018background\u2019 effects such as waviness or deep cracks). Notwithstanding errors of form, the induced surface roughness of wood adherends has significant effects on adhesive wettability and final adhesive bond strength and fracture toughness (Collett 1972; Ebewele et al. 1980; Nussbaum and Sterley 2002). To bond wood surfaces, specialized liquid adhesives have been developed that allow wetting and conformation with the surface, but limit seepage into the substrate and its resultant starvation of the glueline. Therefore surface characterization of wood and OSB strands commonly includes assessment of surface energy, with measurement of contact angles in relation to adhesive wettability (Shupe et al. 1998; Maldas and Kamdem 1999; Shi and Gardner 2001; Nussbaum and Sterley 2002).\nOne of the biggest problems with defining wood surface roughness in relation to adhesion is the porous and permeable nature of the wood, giving it \u2018internal roughness\u2019 that is not picked up by stylus tracings (Ebewele et al. 1980). Some drawbacks of stylus tracings include slow measurement speed, surface damage, catching of the stylus in holes or deep fissures, 2-dimensional sampling, results being influenced by environmental vibrations, and stylus and arm variables (Devoe et al. 1992; Hu and Afzal 2005). Today, stylus tracings have largely been replaced by non-contact methods of laser displacement sensing of the surface to map the surface topography (Lundberg and Porankiewicz 1995; Sandak and Tanaka 2003; Sandak et al. 2004; Hu and Afzal 2005). A commercially available non-contact laser profiling system was used in this study, due to occasional deeply fissured surfaces, and detached tissue on bamboo strands susceptible to dislodgement by a stylus.\nThe objective of this study was to measure the surface roughness indices (average roughness, Ra, and maximum roughness, Rz of bamboo strands classified by feel as \u2018smooth\u2019 or \u2018rough\u2019 and compare these indices with those measured on \u2018smooth\u2019 and \u2018rough\u2019 industrial OSB strands produced from aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx). The results are compared to and discussed in relation to the known size of resin droplets administered during OSB furnish blending.\nAssessment of strand surface quality was done in two ways. First, a qualitative classification using a combination of visual and tactile assessments of each measured strand from Part I was made as to whether each strand fell into one of three surface roughness groupings: (1) rough on both sides, (2) smooth on one side and rough on the other, or (3) smooth on both sides. Tactile assessment of surface roughness can be subjective, particularly if there are several categories, and the boundaries between categories are indistinct. For this reason, the number of categories was restricted to three, with most sampled strands easily classified into one of the three.\nSecond, a laser surface profiler from LaserScan LT (Solaris, San Francisco, USA), fitted with a Keyence K2000 Series LK-031 sensor head, was used to measure the topographic features, i.e., the height and depth of the ridges and valleys running parallel to the length of the strand. This was done to quantitatively characterize surfaces assessed subjectively by touch as either \u2018rough\u2019 or \u2018smooth\u2019 in each type of sliced tissue (aspen, moso, and guadua). Surface profile data were mapped and analyzed using Solar Map Universal 3.2 software. Six specimens, each of seven types of surface, were scanned for a total of 42 scans. The seven surface types were (1) aspen \u2018smooth\u2019, (2) aspen \u2018rough\u2019, (3) moso \u2018smooth\u2019, (4) moso \u2018rough\u2019, (5) guadua \u2018smooth\u2019, (6) guadua \u2018rough\u2019, and (7) a \u2018smooth\u2019 reference surface of sliced moso bamboo veneer. This cabinet-quality veneer is produced in China by pre-softening large laminated billets and using a large sharpened wedge blade to slice thin veneer sheets measuring 2400-mm \u00d7 1200-mm \u00d7 0.6-mm in thickness. The veneer is kept intact by a layer of high tear strength paper adhered to the back.\nand Rpi and Rvi are the ith highest peak and lowest valley, respectively.\nA DX100 Olympus Digital Light Reflection Microscope (5x magnification) was used to examine the sliced transverse cross-sections through the culm wall of moso and Guadua tissue. This was to provide a visual comparison of the morphology of the vascular bundles likely affecting the surface quality of the sliced strands.\nCursory examination of both industrial aspen mill strands and bamboo strands suggested considerable visual and tactile variation in the surface roughness of strands. The surface quality of wood products is still often assessed by feel (tactile) judgment, but due to the complexity and variability of the material no universally accepted standard parameter for characterizing and comparing the roughness of wood surfaces has ever been developed (Fujiwara et al. 2004). The macroscopic visual appearance of strand surfaces of moso, guadua, and aspen mill strands subjectively assessed \u2018rough\u2019 and \u2018smooth\u2019 to touch is shown in Figure 1a to c. Figure 1d shows the surface condition at the site of node tissue in the culm wall. Note the much wider zone of node tissue in the guadua strands. Slicing through the site of the embedded node tissue in the culm wall of guadua resulted in a very uneven, and in many cases broken up, surface.\nFig. 1. Surface appearance of: (a) moso, (b) guadua, (c) aspen mill strands. The top strand surface in the images was classified as \u2018rough\u2019, and the bottom strand surface was classified as \u2018smooth\u2019. (d) shows the appearance of the sliced node tissue in moso and guadua.\nThe proportions of moso and guadua strands falling into each of the three surface quality categories, stranded using the same flaker operating parameters, are given in Table 1. The majority (60%) of industrial aspen strands could be classified as \u2018smooth\u2019 on both sides, and 10% were classified as \u2018rough\u2019 on both sides. Experiments (Semple et al. 2014) in adjusting tissue MC and flaker operating parameters to optimize the thickness distribution and quality of strands from moso bamboo found that strand surface quality for moso was very sensitive to tissue moisture content, knife protrusion settings, material feed rates, and whether the pieces were stranded horizontally or vertically, i.e., slicing across or along the grain, respectively. Full tissue saturation above 130% MC, low knife protrusion settings, slower feed rates, and stranding parallel to the fiber direction are all necessary to maximize the proportion of \u2018smooth-both-sides\u2019 strands.\nDespite these efforts, no more than about a quarter of the bulk moso strands could be classified as \u2018smooth\u2019 on both sides. Another quarter of the bulk moso strands were distinctly smooth on one side and rough on the other. The rough surface of these moso strands is characterized by the presence of very thin and flat strips of parenchyma tissue that has sheared away from the bulk strand tissue, as seen in Fig. 1a and close-up in Fig. 2a.\nThe observed generation of rough surfaces is believed to be due to tensile stress and shearing forces acting on the backs of strands. This may be caused by the angled back of the cutting blade. The counter knife angle is designed to force sliced wood veneers to break up along the grain into narrower pieces to ensure most strands end up between about 25 and 50 mm in width (Maietta et al. 2011). A higher angle is used for denser, stronger woods. A schematic diagram of the slicing action is shown in Fig. 3.\nThree factors that were unable to be changed during stranding were the knife profile, counter knife angle, and the need to boil the pieces to re-saturate them prior to stranding. According to De Vallance et al. (2012), two adjustable process variables \u2014 MC and knife angle, directly impinge on the strand size and surface quality of \u2018difficult-to-strand\u2019 hardwoods like red oak. Knife angle critically affects the surface quality of veneer sliced from blocks (Spelter 1991). De Vallance et al. (2012) were able to make significant improvements to the size and quality of red oak strands by reducing knife speed down from current industrial flaker settings and using blades with a lower counter knife angle, thus placing less fracture stress on the material. Here, the bamboo tissue was saturated to its maximum capacity to ensure that tissue dryness was not a limiting factor, but it was not possible to adjust the counter knife angle. It is therefore possible that further improvements in the quality of both guadua and moso strands could be had by reducing or eliminating the counter knife angle, as well as other adjustable parameters such as cutting speed. The profiled counter knife is also unnecessary since the width of bamboo strands is already constrained by the limited culm wall thickness.\nStrand quality in guadua was markedly lower than that of moso, despite using the same stranding parameters used to produce the best outcome for moso. From Table 1 only 5% of the sampled bulk guadua strands could be classified as \u2018smooth\u2019 on both sides. The majority of guadua strands (65%) were both visually and tactilely \u2018rough\u2019 on both surfaces. Many of these were split apart, as seen in Fig. 2b (top strand), rather than sliced cleanly, as seen in Fig. 2b (bottom strand). The appearance of the transverse surface across the grain of the culm wall of moso and guadua is shown in Fig. 4.\nThe very large and solid vascular bundles present in guadua give it higher average density and far superior flexural stiffness than moso. From Part I, the average basic density of the stranded guadua and moso culm tissue was 533 kg/m3 and 447 kg/m3, respectively. Comparative tests on the two species by De Vos (2010) showed guadua to be 75% higher in MOE (14 GPa) of internode tissue than moso, but only slightly higher in MOR (130 MPa compared to 115 MPa for moso). Interestingly, De Vos (2010) found guadua to be less than half the Janka hardness of moso (2500 N compared to almost 6000 N for moso internode tissues). Despite this apparent difference in hardness, guadua was still far more problematic to strand than moso, likely because of its greater average density and the more extreme differences in density and hardness of the two main culm wall tissue components: the fiber bundles, and the surrounding parenchyma ground tissue. Many of the guadua strands tended to split apart rather than slice cleanly, producing a rough surface with lots of raised ridges that correspond to the separation of the very large and solid fiber bundles (also known as vascular bundles) from the much softer and weaker parenchyma tissue. The largest of the vascular bundles of guadua were around 1.1 mm high and 0.5 mm wide, similar to those observed and measured by Aijazi (2013) in scanning electron microscopy images though the culm wall cross section of guadua. These very large, closely spaced fiber bundles in guadua tissue are in contrast with the much smaller and more discrete vascular bundles of moso tissue of the transverse section of the culm wall. In contrast, moso vascular bundles are approximately 40 \u00b5m high and 300 \u00b5m wide (Dixon and Gibson 2014). In the moso tissue sampled, many of the fiber sheathes (there are four in a whole fiber bundle) appeared not to be fully solidified, as shown by the light brown zones. This suggests that the fibers may have not yet reached their full maturity and density, and helps explain the much lower basic density of the moso (447 kg/m3). After 1 year, bamboo fibers are hollow and thin walled, and over several subsequent years the fiber walls thicken and the cells solidify almost completely, leaving minimal lumen space (Leise and Weiner 1996).\nWhile the volume fraction of fibers in the culm wall of bamboo is strongly gradational across the culm wall, the average volume fraction for guadua ranges from about 42% to 49% (Estrada et al. 2014). Fiber volume fraction for moso is on average around 40% (Osorio et al. 2010), and ranges from 15 to 20% in the inner wall to 60-65% at the outer wall (Amada et al. 1997). Guadua fibers are not only more voluminous compared to moso, but they are also very dense at 1440 kg/m3 (Trujillo et al. 2010). The fibers are extremely tough and strong with a reported tensile strength and elastic modulus (tensile) of chemically extracted fibers of 234 MPa and 20.6 GPa (Ramirez et al. 2012), and for fibers extracted using optimized mechanical extraction, 800 MPa and 43 GPa, respectively; these values are comparable to those of glass fibers (Van Vuure et al. 2009; Trujillo et al. 2010). The parenchyma cells of the ground tissue surrounding the vascular bundles are very short and blocky with thin walls (Leise and Grosser 1972; Leise 1998), and the tissue density is just 330 kg/m3 (Dixon and Gibson 2014). Its strength is only a tenth of that of the vascular bundles themselves (Amada et al. 1997). Unless the blade is very sharp and slices cleanly through the fiber bundles longitudinally, the shearing force exerted along the culm wall will simply rupture the parenchyma tissue surrounding the fibers, leaving them exposed on the surfaces of strands, giving the kind of surface seen in Fig. 2b (top strand).\nIn the stranded culm materials the frequency of nodes in the culm was less for guadua (3.3 nodes per m) than moso (3.8), but the node plates and embedded node tissue in guadua was over twice as thick (Semple et al. 2015a). Note in Fig. 2d the much greater damage to the surface caused by slicing through embedded node tissue in guadua compared with moso. Previous research (De Vos 2010) has noted the very poor planed surface quality of solid guadua tissue, especially at the nodes. In the node zone of the culm wall the anatomy of the vascular bundles changes considerably, becoming extensively branched, intertwined, and interconnected by repeated anastomoses (Grosser and Leise 1971). Fiber length is also shortest at the nodes, leading to greater tissue weakness (Leise and Grosser 1972; Shao et al. 2010). Sampling of the noded strands from guadua found up to 45% of the bulk strands broken into two shorter pieces. Slicing this tissue would be akin to trying to slice through a knot of very thick rope.\nThe only known previous attempt to convert guadua tissue to strands was conducted by Dagilis (1999), similarly using a disk flaker. The author found that wafer quality was so poor as to preclude the fabrication of waferboards (the precursor to OSB), but did not elaborate on any wafer quality parameters such as breakage or surface characteristics. Short of simply cross cutting guadua culms into shorter rounds and discarding the node sections, there appears to be currently no practical way of removing the node plates. Since docking culms into short lengths is impractical and wasteful, a purpose-designed corer with a hardened steel or diamond-tipped tooling head would be a useful development for the guadua processing industry. The nodes are also largest and most numerous in the bottom portion of each whole culm, so one relatively simple strategy for minimizing the effects of nodes on OSB boards may be to separate the lower portion of each culm and only use the strands from these in the core layers of boards where consistency of strand length and strength properties is not as critical.\nAverage Ra and Rz values, and coefficient of variation (CV) for the six specimens from each of seven surface types are given in Table 2. A visual example of the raw surface roughness profiles (Fig. 5) and the typical 3-D topographic map constructed for a surface (Fig. 6) is shown for the \u2018smooth\u2019 and \u2018rough\u2019 surface of guadua strands. For the purpose of this study, a characteristic average roughness index was measured to characterize the two subjective tactile roughness groupings \u2018rough\u2019 and \u2018smooth.\nThe smoothest of the \u2018smooth\u2019 to touch surfaces was the fine sliced moso cabinet-makers veneer, Ra = 7.19 \u00b5m, followed by the \u2018smooth\u2019 moso strands, Ra = 7.70 \u00b5m. Corresponding Rz values for these two surfaces were 37.63 \u00b5m and 43.97 \u00b5m, respectively. Interestingly, the industrial aspen strands classified by touch as \u2018smooth\u2019 were similar in measured surface characteristics to the guadua strands classified as \u2018smooth\u2019; Ra = 10.11 \u00b5m and 10.70 \u00b5m, and Rz = 57.98 \u00b5m and 57.33 \u00b5m, respectively. The strands from the three tissue types classified by touch as \u2018rough\u2019 were more variable in their measured surface characteristics. The roughest surfaces were found on guadua strands, Ra = 23.38 \u00b5m. It is interesting to note that all the strand surfaces subjectively classified by feel as \u2018rough\u2019 were remarkably similar in the measured topographic feature that makes them noticeably rough to feel, i.e., the average vertical distance of the five highest and lowest peaks and valleys of the surface, represented by Rz. Average Rz values are 113.83 \u00b5m, 115.43 \u00b5m, and 115.22 \u00b5m for the \u2018rough\u2019 to touch aspen, moso, and guadua strands, respectively. However, note also the very high CV values in Table 2, especially for Rz of \u2018rough\u2019 surfaces indicating the large variation in measured roughness within the two groups.\nAccurately correlating measured (contact or non-contact method) surface roughness parameters with tactile roughness has proven very difficult (Fujii et al. 1997; Fujiwara et al. 1998, 2001, 2004). A surface rated very smooth to the touch can have a few very narrow, but deep, fissures caused by slicing along a vessel element that can greatly skew mathematically derived roughness parameters obtained directly from a measured profile. An example of this is the \u2018smooth\u2019- rated surface of guadua strands, whereby there is a deep valley caused by slicing lengthways though a vessel element within a fiber bundle (Fig. 2a and Fig. 3a). Topographic features as this had an upwards skew effect on the Ra for \u2018smooth\u2019 guadua strands compared with \u2018smooth\u2019 moso strands, both of which felt similar to the touch. Better linkage of tactile roughness with measured roughness indices is possible using a Robust Gaussian Regression Filter (RFRF) (Brinkmann et al. 2000). This reduces or eliminates \u2018outlier\u2019 effects that cannot be discerned by, or affect, the feel of the overall surface (Fujiwara et al. 2004). However, if considering surface roughness in relation to adhesion, such filters can mask the presence of topographic features that strongly influence adhesive interaction with the surface and the ability to form adequate bonds.\nThe results from the surface roughness measurements has potential implications for the efficiency of bonding with small resin droplets dispensed from spinning disk atomizers during OSB strand blending. Numerous studies have shown that for a given dose of resin, many very small droplets or particles of solid resin and wax lead to superior flake or OSB board properties rather than fewer, larger resin spots (Schwarz et al. 1968; Kasper and Chow 1980; Ellis 1993; Kamke et al. 1996; Saunders and Kamke 1996; Smith 2003 a,b). The size and spacing of the droplets is critical. Optimum resin spot diameter has been shown to be between about 300 \u00b5m and 400 \u00b5m, with spacing no greater than 300 \u00b5m (Smith 2003b). There is no information directly linking the size of the pits and fissures in machined OSB strands with the size of the droplets administered during blending of strands with resin. A recommended droplet diameter for a typical PF resin used in OSB manufacture, dispensed from a spinning disk atomizer (SDA) is 94 \u00b5m (Smith 2003b). Experiments using industrial blender operating parameters (resin flow rate, SDA disk rotational speed) by Zhang et al. (2008) found much smaller droplet diameters ranging from 0.25 to 60 \u00b5m. 90% of the spray volume consisted of droplets <30 \u00b5m, and up to 15% of the spray volume consisted of droplets <10 \u00b5m in diameter. This was smaller than the average peak-valley difference (Ra), and certainly smaller than the average maximum roughness (Rz) of the rough-surface bamboo strands. If the strands being blended have high peaks and deep valleys, then the very small droplets administered by SDA during blending are likely to disappear into fissures, and will be unable to contribute to bonding. A deeply fissured surface (such as the loose side of a veneer) also creates the opportunity for adhesive over-penetration and starvation of the glueline, particularly for resins with low surface tension (Shupe et al. 1998). Therefore, surface roughness and topography of wood adherends, such as veneer or strands, could greatly affect the bond strength depending on the adhesive system, and its amount and distribution on adherends.\nThe bond strength of discrete and scattered resin spots between OSB strands relies on the ability of strands to plasticize and deform sufficiently during hot pressing to form very tight, continuous wood-wood contact (Wolcott et al. 1990). The vast majority of bonds between strands result from a resin spot on one strand contacting a resin-free area on an adjacent strand (Smith 2003b). If smooth, intimate contact between the two surfaces is not made, then a bond is unlikely to be formed, and that resin is wasted. Aspen strands soften, compress and conform tightly to one-another during hot pressing, and administering very small droplets during blending does not appear to pose any significant problems for product quality. Investigations on pressing bamboo strand boards (Semple et al. 2015b) found that, unlike aspen, the harder and denser bamboo strands do not compress and conform to each other under normal OSB hot pressing conditions, leaving visible gaps between strands. This means that bonding by tiny, discrete droplets in bamboo strand boards could be more sensitive to the surface roughness of bamboo strands. Further work is required to examine the interactions between bond strength formation and the surface roughness of bamboo strands.\nMoso and guadua bamboo produced different strand surface quality when stranded using a disk flaker designed for relatively soft, low density woods such as aspen. The majority of guadua strands were visually and tactilely classified as \u2018rough\u2019 on both sides, and only 5% could be considered \u2018smooth\u2019 on both sides. The remainder had one \u2018rough\u2019 and one \u2018smooth\u2019 surface. About a quarter of moso strands were \u2018smooth\u2019 on both sides, compared with 60% of aspen mill strands.\nAverage measured surface roughness (Ra) of the \u2018smooth\u2019 moso strand surface was 7.7 \u00b5m, while that of aspen mill strands and guadua were similar at 10.1 \u00b5m and 10.7 \u00b5m, respectively.The Ra value of \u2018rough\u2019 strand surfaces was 17.4 \u00b5m, 20.9 \u00b5m, and 23.4 \u00b5m for aspen, moso, and guadua, respectively.\nThe average maximum roughness (average distance between the five largest peaks and valleys, Rz) values were similar for all three strand types classified as \u2018rough\u2019; approximately 115 \u00b5m.\nThe average and maximum roughness values for the strand surfaces exceeded the reported diameter of most droplets dispensed by spinning disk atomizers used in OSB furnish blending. This could potentially affect bonding efficiency, particularly in the case of the bamboo strands, in which there was a much greater proportion of very rough strands, and which do not conform and compress during hot pressing.\nThis study was funded through an NSCERC (National Science and Engineering Research Council) G8 Tri-Council grant.

See you there!\nGive an essayhelp24 writing service a chance to make for you a perfect paper, these people pay great attention to details, so you'll get all you want.\nLast time the meet-up happened I was doing my damn writing stuff. Next time I wont miss it cuz I\"ve discovered uk-essay-reviews and they will fix all my essay assignments while I will enjoy dancing.\nOccasionally, I came across paperhelp.org that was top rated and had positive reviews. Before placing an order I made sure it was not scam and after contacting the support team I ordered the paper. The task was ready within the deadline.\nHappy happy days. I used to dance too since my mom first brought me, a first year school student, to a dancing studio. This was love from the first move! Ah..",

    "text": "TO THE LAST, they sing the same song: They hate corruption. They love the poor. They mean well. They are true. They are good. They are pure.\nOr at least that is what they say or claim in their political ads.\nThe same narrative almost defines the campaign of the top candidates for both national and local posts in the May 2016 elections. But more than desire or ambition to rule the nation and control the public purse, a few other things unite them, too.\nFor at least four of the five candidates for president, five for vice president, 22 for senator, six party-list groups, and 17 candidates for local positions, trying to get themselves elected has meant spending like crazy on political ads.\nAccording to Nielsen Media\u2019s monitoring reports \u2013 to which PCIJ has subscribed \u2013 a total of 108,573 \u201csocial concerns\u201d ads worth P7.75 billion, by the media agencies\u2019 rate cards, were aired and published from Jan. 1, 2015 to Jan. 31, 2016.\nOf this, about 105,000 ads valued at P6.7 billion or 86.4 percent featured apparent candidates in the May 2016 elections as \u201cadvertiser\u201d or \u201cproduct\u201d from March 2015 to January 2016.\nAbout 90 percent of these pre-campaign ads aired on the top-rating TV news and teleserye programs during prime-time hours (5 p.m. to 10 p.m.), and on popular talk-news programs on national and regional radio networks. The balance ran in national newspapers and magazines.\nThe amount of money spent on campaign advertising not only indicates the overflowing coffers of many candidates and parties, but also their willful abuse of a system that imposes caps on campaign spending and airtime limits only during the campaign period.\nImpunity marks, too, the stubborn secrecy of most candidates about who paid for, or from which sources they got money for the ads. Prodded by reporters to reveal more facts, the candidates have a uniform curt reply: Donations from unnamed donors paid for their ads.\nAccording to law, the official 90-day campaign period began only last Feb. 9. This is even though those running in the upcoming polls became official candidates from when they filed their certificates of candidacy in October 2015.\nEfforts by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to amend the law so it could start the meter running on candidates\u2019 spending much earlier have been repeatedly foiled in Congress.\nYet while candidates in the May 2016 polls may get free pass from still porous election laws for their pre-campaign ads, they may have a hard time escaping from the legal and administrative liabilities that they and their donors may face, by the text and letter of anti-graft, civil service, and tax laws.\nBy reason and logic, the billions of pesos they have spent on pre-campaign ads could have come only from three sources: their own money, their yet unnamed donors, or public funds and purses.\nBy the data enrolled in their 2014 or latest SALN filing, many of the candidates who had already run up millions of pesos in ad bills before Feb. 9 have neither sufficient net worth nor cash on hand or in bank to be able to finance their pre-campaign ads.\nLaws do not sleep or lie in wait during election campaigns, and in the view of four regulatory agencies \u2013 Comelec, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Office of the Ombudsman \u2013 these candidates and their donors have some serious explaining to do.\nComelec Commissioner Christian Robert S. Lim, head of the poll body\u2019s Campaign Finance Office (CFO), notes, for instance, that anti-graft laws prohibit public officials from accepting or receiving gifts in cash or in kind from private sources, as well as from using their public office for private gain. Many of those running for office are incumbents.\nCollecting taxes on donations, meanwhile, is what BIR Commissioner Kim Jacinto Henares tells PCIJ she would be interested to do.\nThe National Internal Revenue Code imposes a 30-percent tax on donations from stranger to stranger (in this case, the donors and the candidates), that must be remitted to the bureau within 60 days of the receipt of donation. Failing this, surcharges and penalties of up to 20 percent per year will apply, says Henares.\nHenares also says she will be keeping watch over mass-media agencies, notably the television networks, to check their remittance of the commensurate value-added tax collected from pre-campaign ad buys.\nHenares says she plans to check the BIR\u2019s files to see if the donors of funds that the candidates spent on pre-campaign ads have yielded any payments of the donor\u2019s tax from any parties at all in the last few months.\nThe SEC, for its part, issued a legal opinion in July 2015 in which it explicitly banned all corporations from donating to candidates and political parties.\nAs for the Office of the Ombudsman, its senior officials say they are keen to monitor and review how the candidates have sourced money for their political ads, especially in light of the wealth they have declared in their respective statements of assets, liabilities, and net worth or SALN.\nFor sure, some candidates have said that they have no idea on who have donated to their campaign \u2014 the better, they say, to shield themselves from favor-seeking donors. And yet indications are that the candidates and their finance and campaign managers know not only who their donors are, but also how their ad agents paid for the ads.\nFor one, ads are booked and paid for clients \u2014 in this case the candidates \u2014 by the ad placement agencies that the former have hired. The TV networks have uniform rules for these deals: It\u2019s PBB or \u201cpay before broadcast\u201d or the ads will not run, and pay in cash or direct deposit of payment to the networks\u2019 bank accounts.\nFor another, some ad agents now working with several candidates have told PCIJ that because they booked the ads, they pay for these direct to the networks, after getting the required cash payment from either the candidates\u2019 finance manager, campaign manager, or communication team manager. They do not, the ad agents say, deal with the candidates\u2019 donors at all.\nAds are also more than just about the networks\u2019 rate cards, points out the agent. An equally big but hidden cost that candidates incur goes to producing the ad materials that could run on TV. Ad-material production, in turn, normally has candidates sitting through concept and storyboard discussions, attending shoots, talking or acting before the cameras, and then reviewing and approving the ads for broadcast.\nIt is industry practice for ad agents with established contractual relations with networks to get a 10- to 15-percent commission on ad placements they book.\nSome candidates and political parties, of course, may have to explain more than others regarding their pre-campaign ad spends.\nTopping Nielsen\u2019s reports on pre-campaign ad spenders is the Liberal Party pair of former Interior and Local Government Secretary Manuel \u2018Mar\u2019 Roxas II (P969,173,267) and Camarines Sur Rep. Maria Leonor \u2018Leni\u2019 Robredo (P273,856,544), who also had tandem ads worth P92,326,469. Together, their combined total ad buys as of Jan. 31, 2016 come up to P1,335,356,280.\nRoxas\u2019s ads started running in August 2015. For January 2016 alone, his ad spend was P291,145,762, including P234,961,626 for TV ads and P56,184,136 for radio ads.\nRobredo\u2019s ads first hit the airwaves only in November 2015. In January 2016 alone, she incurred P89,810,523 in ad spend, including P89,457,723 for TV ads and P352,800 for radio ads.\nThe duo\u2019s total ad spots of 22,542 consisted of 20,159 for Roxas, 540 featuring both of them, and 1,843 for Robredo \u2013 in all cases mostly aired on TV.\nApart from the ad spend of Roxas and Robredo, eight of the 12 candidates for senator of the Liberal Party had also incurred a combined total of P659,991,074 of political ads.\nIn all, the administration party led by President Benigno S. Aquino III and its national candidates had already invested a grand total of nearly P2 billion \u2013P1,995,347,354, or a third of the P6.69 billion spent on political ads for the period.\nThe LP bets are followed by the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) candidates Vice President Jejomar Binay and Sen. Gregorio Honasan, who have a combined total ad spend of P1,144,345,760. The bulk of this sum went to promoting Binay\u2019s run for the presidency, P1,050,065,095. By contrast, their tandem ads cost only a total of P64,607,324, while Honasan\u2019s solo ads ran up a bill of P29,673,341.\nBinay\u2019s ads started airing in June 2015; in January 2016 alone, he placed ads worth P347,470,186, including P14,760,488 for radio ad spots.\nTotal ad spots for Binay, Binay/Honasan, and Honasan came up to 9,071. It included 8,781 solo ads for Binay, 177 for the Binay-Honasan tandem, and only 113 solo ads for Honasan.\nAlso in the Billion-Peso Ad Club is the Galing at Puso slate of Senators Grace Poe and Francis \u2018Chiz\u2019 Escudero, which incurred total ad spend of P1,019,190,923. Interestingly, only a sliver or P2,776,800 of that amount covered Escudero\u2019s solo ads.\nFor this ad spend, Poe acquired total ad spots of 24,971 mostly on TV and radio, and Escudero, 618, mostly on radio.\nPoe\u2019s ads started airing in August 2015. In January 2016 alone, she acquired ads worth P274,120,425, including P207,012,211 for TV ads, and P67,074,614 for radio ads.\nA fourth tandem, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte (PDP-Laban) and Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano (Nacionalista Party) ranked fourth in the list of ad spenders. Their ad spend came up to P715,943,742, broken down as follows: P146,351,131 for Duterte; P419,002,456 for Cayetano; P62,630,621 for them both; P87,885,089 about Cayetano and wife Taguig City Mayor Lani Cayetano; and P74,445 for the PDP-Laban.\nThe pair acquired a combined total of 2,157 ad spots, including 1,533 that featured Duterte alone.\nDuterte\u2019s first ad came out in March 2015 but it stopped airing for a few months later, or while he remained unsure about running for president. When he finally decided to run in December 2015, Duterte\u2019s ads picked up speed again before Christmas. In January 2016 alone, he placed TV ads valued at P10,105,180.\nCayetano, in contrast, acquired a total of 421 TV ad spots for himself, and another 98 ad spots featuring him with his wife Lani, starting April 2015. He stopped airing ads in January 2016 though.\nIndependent candidate for vice president Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV was featured in pre-campaign ads worth P8,953,380, according to Nielsen. His total ad spots: 984.\nThe People\u2019s Reform Party\u2019s Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago distinguished herself as the only candidate for president who did not air or publish any pre-campaign advertisement. Her running mate, Sen. Ferdinand \u2018Bongbong\u2019 Marcos Jr. of the Nacionalista Party, however, bought ads by the bucket.\nMarcos\u2019s ad buys began in June 2015. It had reached P252,503,856 in value as of Jan. 31, 2016, according to Nielsen Media. It paid for 4,199 ad spots on TV, radio, and print.\nBut some candidates for the country\u2019s top two posts also invested in creative \u2013 and costly \u2013 means to gain exposure. Among them is the Liberal Party\u2019s demure vice-presidential bet Robredo, whose life story was featured last Feb. 6 on the top-rating \u201cMaalaala Mo Kaya\u201d program of ABS-CBN Entertainment. Young star Dimples Romana played Robredo\u2019s part, and actor Marvin Agustin, that of Robredo\u2019s late husband Jesse.\nTwo candidates for president have also invaded entertainment TV, or tapped entertainment stars to up their appeal to voters.\nDuterte guested on ABS-CBN\u2019s \u201cGandang Gabi Vice\u201d variety show on Dec. 7, 2015.\nRoxas, meanwhile, had a dramatized interview with teen heartthrob Daniel Padilla in a video that was first posted on YouTube on Nov. 6, 2015. As of this writing, it has drawn less than 9,000 views and about 200 mostly critical comments.\nIn addition, Roxas and Robredo starred in the \u201cFast Forward\u201d MTV of an all-star cast of actors from the ABS-CBN and GMA7 networks. Posted on YouTube on Dec. 5, 2015, it has drawn about 740,000 views.\nMedia agents say such cameo roles or guest appearance for the candidates on entertainment TV can be had only for a hefty price. In fact, they say, the cost of these special promotional packages is equivalent to at least four to five minutes of ad placements, or about P4 million to P5 million. A minute-long ad on prime-time TV goes for at least P900,000.\nAs a norm, the candidate\u2019s team will also have to cover the talent fees and other production cost of the actors and the program\u2019s staff.\nIn the meantime, many wanna-be\u2019s for Senate seats bought millions of pesos of pre-campaign ads as well.\nGuingona, Recto, and Drilon are re-electionist senators, and Lacson, a returning senator. Three others are appointees of President Benigno S. Aquino III \u2014 De Lima, former justice secretary; Petilla, former energy secretary; and Villanueva, former director-general of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. Hontiveros was former Akbayan party-list representative.\nFourteen candidates for senator from the other political parties also spent a total of P1.33 billion on pre-campaign ads during the period.\nTopping the list is Bongbong Marcos\u2019s cousin, Leyte\u2019s 1st District Rep. Ferdinand Martin Romualdez who acquired twice more ads than the former, P502,392,924, from August 2015 to January 2016. He is serving his third and last term in Congress.\nGatchalian, Romulo, and Pacquiao are district representatives, while Bello and Colmenares are party-list representatives in the 16th Congress. Osmena is a re-electionist senator, Zubiri a former senator, and Tolentino, recently resigned chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. Moreno is serving his third and last term as vice mayor of Manila.\nAs a group, these candidates for national office accounted for P6.69 billion or 86.38 percent of the P7.75 billion in total \u201csocial concerns\u201d ads purchased from TV, radio, and print media agencies, from January 2015 to January 31, 2016.\nThis figure even came from various advertisers, including a joint ad series of the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front worth P6.48 million for the BBL throughout 2015, as well as the local officials and leaders of Sulu, and the Usapang BBL group.",

    "text": "Columbia, MD \u2013 September 23, 2015 \u2013 SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: WNDW), a leading developer of first-of-their-kind transparent electricity-generating coatings, today announced that the company\u2019s latest products will be engineered as transparent, tinted, flexible veneers that installers can apply directly over top of existing windows on tall towers and skyscrapers. This expanded product line broadens the company\u2019s market reach beyond new and replacement installations, to include windows currently installed on the estimated five million commercial buildings constructed in the U.S. alone.\nToday\u2019s product expansion announcement follows the successful unveiling of SolarWindow\u2122 working prototypes for new construction and replacement windows, only weeks earlier. These latest retrofit systems will be developed in addition to the SolarWindow\u2122 products already under commercialization.\nSolarWindow\u2122 achieves the industry\u2019s fastest published financial payback of less than one year as validated by a team of independent engineers and at the University of North Carolina Charlotte Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (UNCC-EPIC).\nEngineers envision installing SolarWindow\u2122 products on all four sides of tall towers, generating electricity using natural, shaded, and even artificial light. Conventional solar does not work in shaded areas or perform under artificial light. As a result, SolarWindow\u2122 modules outperform today\u2019s rooftop solar by as much as 50-fold more energy generated when modeled for installation on a 50-story building.\nA single installation of the company\u2019s SolarWindow\u2122 technology is calculated to avoid 2.2 million miles of vehicle pollution, at least 12-times more than today\u2019s solar systems on building rooftops; and could reduce carbon emissions equivalent to 770 acres of forest, compared to today\u2019s rooftop (PV) systems equivalent to only 20 to 70 acres of forest, according to engineers.\nToday\u2019s milestone announcement comes on the heels of the company\u2019s August 20, 2015 webcast that revealed for the first time its revenue, industry partnership, and build-out strategy for bringing SolarWindow\u2122 products to market. The event featured SolarWindow and industry experts discussing the company\u2019s technology objectives, commercialization path, recent technological advances, logistical challenges, and breakthroughs.

When attached to the GFX body, the lens produces a focal length equivalent to 79-158mm on full-frame, in case you need to capture longer distances the lens also has the option of GF1.4X TC WR teleconverter that extends lens\u2019s focal length by 1.4 times, to cover the focal length range of 140mm-280mm (equivalent to 111-221mm in the 35mm film format).\nCurrently, the Fujifilm GF 100-200mm F5.6 R LM OIS WR lens will be available for global pre-order on Bhphotovideo.com and selling will be starting on February 14th. with a price tag of $1,999.95.\nThis GF 100-200mm F5.6 lens is also Fujifilm\u2019s first telephoto zoom lens for Medium Format sensors, fully support the 100MP+ image sensor, to be incorporated in the GFX Series\u2019 flagship model is about to launch. This will be a narrow-angle lens so it will be suitable for portraits, landscapes, and nature with a long focusing distance and still give the highest quality of GF lens line.\nIn terms of design, this lens has an optical structure with 20 elements in 13 groups, in which there are 2 Super ED lens elements and 1 aspherical lens elements, which minimizes chromatic aberration and distortion to help capture images more perfect with high color reproduction. In addition, to ensure high performance for the lens, Fujifilm also equipped with a linear autofocus motor system that enables the camera to focus faster and quieter in combination with a locking mechanism, preventing movement. The need for lenses when the device is inactive increases the life of the lens more than other telephoto lenses. In addition, with the upgrade and change of the position of the linear motor cluster, the lens can keep the focusing position as before when the camera is turned off, making it possible to capture the focus much faster when shooting.\nThe lens offers a 5.0-stop image stabilization performance, which means you can easily hold and manipulate shots without worrying about blurring. The lens\u2019s weather-sealed construction makes it dust and weather resistant and capable of operating in temperatures down to -10\u00b0C, allowing you to shoot even in outdoors in light rain or in dusty conditions, and achieving a high level of reliability as photography equipment for professional photographers.",

Family units were emphazied with the idea that today's family can work and play together by sharing in these activities, even as they did in yesteryear. At first these draft horse enthusiasts would get together on weekends to see what they could do with their horses. As the draft horses were new to this part of the country, interested people would come and see what they were all about. As more and more people came, the idea evolved into Old Farmer's Day!\nAfter a few years the other members of the Louisiana Draft Horse Association decided they didn't want anything to do with the event, so the Brunett Family took the reigns from there!\nSo why October? Most visitors don't fully grasp the concept of why we host this event every year, but more specifically why exactly we hold it in October. Well the answer lies here....Old Farmer's Day is actually a national holiday! That's right, October 12 is a day devoted to old farmers and their farming techniques. Agriculture and farming today is largely mechanized and very scientific, but these developments would not have been possible without the wisdom and hard work of old farmers. While the origins of the holiday are unknown, Old Farmer's Day is celebrated by many across the nation as a throwback to sustainable and farm-to-table farming practices of the old days. This day is to give them thanks, to listen to them and to their stories, and to learn from them and their techniques. We strive to do this very same thing year after year, hence the reason we chose October as the time for our celebration!\nIn the early 1990s a piece of family history was reguvinated, when the very kitchen Gerald's father built in 1904 became the center of attention at Old Farmer's Day.\nOld Farmer's Day \u2022 \u00a92015 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",

    "text": "Some people simply prefer libraries to study but they always resent being unable to eat and drink inside, at coffee shops, on the other hand, students are deprived of the encouraging atmosphere generated by being surrounded by books while studying. For those looking to combine the qualities of a library and a coffee shop, Sankofa, as both a bookstore and a cafe, is certainly there to check out. Amazing food and coffee, internet connection, convenient tables and power outlets\u2026 Just a perfect gem on 2714 Georgia Avenue near Howard University. Open all days from 09:00 a.m. to late evening.\nThree chairs and a table at Sankofa Video, Books & Cafe. Photo: Yelp / Nellie F.\nPlenty of tables, both inside and on the patio, power outlets and a free internet service on top of some of the best sandwiches and coffee you could find in all of D.C. are what Heat Da Spot delivers to our list. It is also hard to match the friendliness of the owner and the staff, just complementing the home feel of the cozy place. Five stars on Yelp will, by no means, be a surprise after your first visit to this Ethiopian diner. On 3213 Georgia Avenue, Heat Da Spot is open all days of the week.\nAn inside view of Heat Da Spot with a group of customers. Photo: Vidhika B.\nIn the same neighborhood as Heat Da Spot, Colony Club stands out with a significantly more spacious area, both in and outdoors. The owner has furnished the place to accomodate students of all ages, with many large tables and outlets available for those looking to study. The availability of a free and strong Wi-Fi connection makes it just easier to benefit from multiple resources while doing that. And when you feel like taking a short break from your material, the ping pong table upstairs could offer a rather joyful one. Besides, there is no chance you would regret the food or coffee you would be served here. Just make sure you drop by before noon on Fridays and Saturdays when it closes at 12:00 a.m.\nGranted, this is not as big as the Colony Club but offers just the calm environment you would need while studying. Plus, their freshly baked pastries and coffee are simply something to return to, not to mention the convenient patio, which would probably be better for studying since Spring is just around the corner now. On 1926 17th Street, Three Fifty Bakery and Coffee Bar opens as early as 7:00 a.m. all work days and serves till 7:00 p.m. The working hours are slightly shorter on weekends.\nWhen the word \u2018coffee\u2019 is pronounced, there are only a few countries to be automatically remembered by most people and Ethiopia is certainly one of them. Originally hailing from the Eastern African country, the owner of Sidamo has done but all to make this place nearly perfect for those willing to study. In walking distance from the Union Station, this cozy coffee shop, too, offers its customers a fine Wi-Fi connection. Just remember to ask for the credentials at the register. And you better arrive sooner than later in the day in order not to be disappointed seeing a packed room inside. Little courtyard in the back, though, might still be a lifesaver.",

    "text": "The Autowatch 211Hi Anti HiJack Immobiliser is Microprocessor controlled and offers effective protection against the ever-increasing problem of vehicle hijacking.\nThe unit installed has been designed to immobilise the vehicle in a hijack situation while at the same time offering you, the legitimate driver, maximum protection by delaying the onset of the hijack routine and thus distancing yourself from the hijacker.\nThe hijack routine is initiated every time the ignition is turned on, and every time door is opened.\nAfter starting the vehicle or opening any door, once all doors are closed (engine on) press the hidden cancel button. Failure to deactivate the hijack will result in a series of audible warnings and, if the hidden button is still not pressed, the immobiliser will slow the vehicle down before stalling it. The indicators will flash and the hooter will sound to attract attention and convince the hijacker to abandon the vehicle. The hooter will continue to sound for 90 seconds after the vehicle has been stalled. For safety purposes the indicators will flash until the hidden button is pressed.\nIf the ignition is turned off after the audible warnings, and prior to the immobiliser cutting the engine, the hooter will sound; pressing the hijack cancel button will silence the system. Even if the warning alerts a hijacker to the existence of the anti hijack immobiliser there is no way to silence the hooter while he searches for the deactivating button.\nThe time between initiating hijack and slowing the vehicle down can be programmed for 1, 2, or 3 minutes. Consult your Autowatch fitment centre if you wish to alter the time selected.\nIt is also possible to configure the immobiliser to delay the timer while the engine is idling. When the vehicle is started, or the door opened, the timer will only start after the engine revs above a pre-set limit. Consult your fitment centre for information on this option.",

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can also be generated by looking for divergences, failure swings, and centerline crossovers. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend. These traditional levels can also be adjusted to better fit the security or analytical requirements. Raising overbought to 80 or lowering oversold to 20 will reduce the number of overbought/oversold readings. Short-term traders sometimes use 2-period RSI to look for overbought readings above 80 and oversold readings below 20.",

    "text": "Sustainable energy is the future for America\u2019s power needs, and Black Hawk College is leading the way in sustainable energy technology. In May 2010, the conventional fossil fuel-powered 500-watt lights that illuminated the sign on the Moline 70th Street entrance were disconnected and replaced with renewable energy-powered LED lights. These six, 14-watt floodlights use a total of 84 watts of electricity, just 1/6th of the power they used to consume. The sign lighting is now powered by clean, renewable energy generated from two solar panels and a micro-wind turbine. The solar panels and wind turbine will alternate charging the battery bank that powers the light at night, depending upon weather conditions.\nThis project was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. It and similar projects will be used to educate not only Black Hawk College students, but middle and high school students from around the Quad Cities.\nOn the BHC campus, the micro-wind turbine and solar panels will be used for research and development in the college\u2019s Sustainable Energy Program. View more pictures.\nSustainable energy comes from sources like sun and the wind, is available every day and cannot be used up. Non-renewable energy sources, or fossil fuels, were made over millions of years by the buildup of plants and animals, sand and mud, and will one day run out. Fossil fuels used every day are coal, oil and natural gas.\nFossil fuels pollute. They produce gasses like carbon dioxide (CO2) that trap heat and cause global warming. Not only is sustainable energy a source that will never deplete, it is also non-polluting. All forms of sustainable energy discussed here produce energy without emitting harmful pollutants. This makes solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass-produced energy a good idea for our country\u2019s future and a growing source of jobs as the sustainable energy industry grows.\nWith its focus on renewable/sustainable energy and a commitment to giving students the skills they need for tomorrow\u2019s technology, BHC offers a Sustainable Energy certificate. This 50-credit hour program can be completed in four semesters and includes AutoCAD, DC circuits, hydraulics/pneumatics, mechatronics, logic systems and sustainable energy systems, among other courses.

This beautiful facility traces the history of the Jewish people and spotlights the constant evolution of the faith and culture worldwide. Exhibits include artifacts, dioramas and murals. Recent Jewish visitors especially liked tracing their own origins right there at the museum, while non-Jewish visitors found the exhibits educational and engaging.\nBeit Hatfutsot is located on the Tel Aviv University campus about 5 miles north of the downtown area. You can reach the museum by bus Nos. 7, 25, 45, 94, 137, 222, 270, 271, 274, 289, 572, train, or taxi. Beit Hatfutsot welcomes visitors from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday through Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Thursday, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. Admission to the general exhibits costs 45 Israeli shekels (about $13), but children 4 and younger get in free. Entry to some of the special exhibits will cost extra.

    "text": "Playing Gods invade the U.K.!\nI am pleased as pickled punch to report that everyone's favorite sacreligious boards game, Playing Gods, recently made its British debut. Yes, my grubby little game made it to the land of leaden skies and bland, overpriced food (no offense, my beloved Brit friends!). The venue was the U.K. Games Expo which was held June 5 through 7 in Birmingham, which is north of London and in the West Midlands, about halfway up to Scotland. I've never been there, but I have a friend from there, and her accent is adorable.\nAt any rate, my U.K. distributor, Paul Evans of JKLMnP, kindly hosted a few Playing Gods games at the Expo. He gave away some stickers and posters (and probably a few T-shirts). He said there was definitely some interest, but few if any sales: some \"Lookey Lukeys but no Byron Buyers,\" as they say in their quirky local Birmingham idiom. I did my part by sending lots of promo swag, we'll see if that helps get some traction in the coming weeks.\nWith a some press help from a marketing friend in London, I did a brief BBC radio interview just after midnight on Sunday morning the 6th. It was a live local broadcast from the Expo (it was 7 in the morning their time), and it went well. It was quick, though, and I only had time to answer about four questions: 1) What is the premise of the game? 2) Why did you choose to include the \"real\" gods? 3) Are you concerned that some people will miss the satire? and 4) Where can people find out more?\nIn other U.K. Playing Gods news, I plan to run a few adverts in the British magazine Fortean Times (for those of you unfamiliar with the title, it's a nice, slick, full-color glossy monthly mag about mysterious, unusual, and paranormal subjects--- sort of like a less-sceptical Skeptical Inquirer). Playing Gods is the sort of game that would appeal to FT readers, who seem to be an independent-thinking, contrary lot. Plus I have a bit of name recognition with that crowd: \"Hey, wasn't this designed by that Yank wanker what keeps disproving them ghost reports?\"\nSuper-secret Playing Gods cabal revealed!

J Clin Gastroenterol 2013; 47:25\u201332.\nThis was the consensus of the 2015 Kyoto H pylori conference,2 and it signaled a fundamental shift in thinking. Up to now, H pylori treatment has not been based on infectious disease principles, leading to suboptimal results and antibiotic resistance. In addition, the conference recommended that H pylori infection be treated whenever it is found unless there are compelling reasons not to.\nHere we review current and possible future regimens for eradicating H pylori that we hope will be more effective and will lead to less resistance than in the past.\nBut infectious diseases differ from most gastrointestinal diseases. In gastrointestinal problems such as constipation or inflammatory bowel disease,10 the causes are generally unknown, and there is a large placebo response to therapy. In contrast, in infectious diseases, the cause is generally known, there is no placebo response, and treatment success depends on susceptibility of the organism. Failure of proven regimens is generally due to resistant organisms, poor adherence, or, in the case of H pylori, poorly designed regimens in terms of doses, frequency of administration, or duration of therapy.\nMany thousands of H pylori-infected patients participated in clinical trials in which the results would have been predictable if the researchers had assessed susceptibility before giving the drugs.11\u201313 Worse, many patients were also randomized to receive regimens that the investigators knew provided poor cure rates in the population being studied. This knowledge was generally not shared with the patients. This approach was used to demonstrate that a new regimen was superior to an old one, even though the new one was already known to be less affected by resistance to the key element in the comparator.\nClinicians generally do not test for susceptibility when treating H pylori, one reason being that such testing is often unavailable.3 However, almost every hospital, clinic, and major laboratory in the world provides susceptibility testing for other common local pathogens. H pylori is easy to grow, and laboratories could test for susceptibility if we asked them to.\nCurrent H pylori recommendations may also contribute to the global increase in antimicrobal resistance.\nAs discussed below, all recent guidelines have recommended 4-drug non-bismuth-containing concomitant therapy as first-line therapy. An infectious disease colleague described it as a \u201chope therapy\u201d because the prescriber hoped that the infection would be susceptible to either metronidazole or clarithromycin. All who receive this combination receive an antibiotic they do not need. This is an expedient rather than a medically rational choice resulting from failure to deal with H pylori as an infectious disease.\nConceptually, treating infectious disease is straightforward: one should prescribe antimicrobial drugs to which the organism is susceptible3 (Table 1). However, clinical success lies in the details, which include the doses, frequency of doses, duration of therapy, timing of doses in relation to meals, and use of adjuvants such as antisecretory drugs, antacids, and probiotics. A number of regimens reliably yield high cure rates\u201495% or higher\u2014if the organism is susceptible and the patients are adherent.\nThe effectiveness of any regimen may vary depending on the population it is used in, due to polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2C19.\nSequential therapy for H pylori infection consisted of amoxicillin plus a proton pump inhibitor for 7 days, followed by clarithromycin, tinidazole, or metronidazole plus a proton pump inhibitor for a further 7 days. This regimen should not be used any more because concomitant therapy will always be superior (see below).\nBleeding esophageal varices: Who should receive a shunt?\nIf symptoms do not respond to a proton pump inhibitor or are atypical, testing may be needed.",

This is a recipe telling you how to make a heavenly hot and cold, a crispy and creamy contrast in a dessert.\nFrying ice cream is actually easier than it sounds and I was glad to find that out, because I had had an exploding churro incident not long ago and had quite repulsion towards frying food. But this recipe requires just a little timing, then everything should be all right.\nHere we go, some fried vanilla ice ceam balls, which taste best served with fresh fruit.\nScoop out the ice cream, press it into the form of a ball with your hands, if necessary. Roll the ice cream spheres in the crushed cookies, then place in the freezer for at least an hour.\nPour oil into a medium-sized or a small, but deep pan, about 4 cm (1 1/2 inches) and heat it up. You know it has the right temperature, when small bubbles appear from a wooden skewer placed in the oil.\nPrepare a plate with paper towels for the fried scoops of ice cream.\nWhile the oil is getting hot, take out the ice cream and roll the balls first in blended egg, then in breadcrumbs.\nCarefully place each ball into the hot oil (a large spoon works best for that) and fry until the crust turns from pale to gold, about 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Carefully place the fried ball on the paper towel, then transfer to a plate.\nYou should serve this dessert immediately after preparing it, so the difference in temperature between crust and ice cream is bigger.",

    "text": "It\u2019s the second week in the month and I\u2019m well on my way to meet my goal of 1,000 miles this year! This weekend we were lucky enough to enjoy some deliciously warm weather \u2013 60 degrees \u2013 so even after a 11 mile run on Friday night, I decided to get out for a run on Sunday to enjoy some new sneakers plus a run in shorts.\nThere have been a few challenges \u2013 the weather hasn\u2019t been the best and many of my runs in the morning have been on the treadmill at the gym, as opposed to outside as I would prefer. But it\u2019s March and the weather will hopefully turn soon, meaning I\u2019m on my way to warmer and less icy days!\nWow\u2026 How did I get in a run every day that week?\nWas due for a 10 miler on Saturday, but B\u2019s knees and shins were hurting him , so I opted to go out for a run by myself on Friday after work. I felt decent for the first double digit run I\u2019d had in a while and I was definitely glad to have gotten the run over with so I could relax and enjoy the weekend with B!\nI was out of town Tuesday and Wednesday this week, so I was thinking that getting a workout in wouldn\u2019t be to easy \u2014 until I realized that I could set my alarm for 6:10 (instead of 5:35 a.m.) on Wednesday to work out before my meeting! It\u2019s the little things.\nWe were due for a 10k on Saturday, but we were in Cincinnati and I honestly didn\u2019t expect us to run at all \u2013 but we ended up doing the Bockfest 5k! Didn\u2019t run for time, but felt good to get out for a run, even in the middle of a beer festival.\nThis past week was great, running-wise. We had an 11 miler scheduled for the weekend, but B and I decided to get it in on Friday after work. I felt much better than I did on my 10 miler (maybe because I actually drank a ton of water that day?) and it was great to just relax and use the elliptical on Saturday. Sunday\u2019s weather was so nice, I couldn\u2019t not go out and enjoy it? PLUS I had just gotten new sneakers! That\u2019s right, I\u2019m retiring the pink Sauconys (they were great though, just worn down) for some pink Nikes.\nThe view from my run on Sunday \u2026 BEAUTIFUL day!\nDo you find yourself running on off days if the weather is nice?\nDoes buying new running shoes or gear get you excited for a run?\nI leave you with the view on Lake Erie Sunday night as the sun was setting. Beautiful!",

    "text": "The word optimization was used more times than I could count. One slide in particular from the presentation, entitled \u201cRapid Manufacturing Scenario,\u201d caught my eye. The speaker described a series of two improvements (noted in the bar charts at the bottom of the slide) using \u201cmachining process optimization software tools.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d I thought \u201cinteresting stuff: virtual verification of NC code, 3D part scanning and digitization, optimal tool paths, automatic program correction\u201d. But I couldn\u2019t help noticing that as operational times were being slashed, the orange bar \u2013 Setup on Machine \u2013 stayed the same. In fact, nowhere in the presentation, was there a mention of machine setup improvement.\nI wondered, \u2018Would this \u2018improved ratio\u2019 of setup to runtime cause a machine shop to run fewer parts or more parts?\u201d For a site grounded in Lean, I think the answer would be \u2018always work on setup reduction in order to run exactly what is needed for the next process.\u201d In the absence of that grounding however, I worry that the ratio would create more over-production to \u201coptimize\u2019 part cost.\nAfter the presentation, I jumped onto the CCAT website and did find a one-day course on set-up reduction (none scheduled however) and an article on Lean simulation software, not a favorite approach with me. I think the real floor is where the action is, not the virtual floor. Call me old-fashioned.\nIn June 2011 our national government announced it would spend $500 million to support advanced manufacturing. I hope they understand what it means. I\u2019m still confused. I worry that Advanced Manufacturing sounds an awful (and I mean awful) lot like Lee Iacocca\u2019s \u201cagile manufacturing\u201d strategy (vintage 1990) to leapfrog Toyota\u2019s system. History did not validate this approach; I hope it has not been repackaged for 2012.\nI recall a complaint offered by Shigeo Shingo in 1989 that while at that time nobody was paying attention to SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Dies), there were a swarm of doctoral dissertations on algorithms for optimizing economical order quantity (advanced manufacturing?) Have we grown beyond that thinking today, or are we still squirming in quicksand?\nBTW: Mark your calendar. The Northeast Shingo Prize Conference is coming up September 25-26, 2012. Hope we\u2019ll see you there.\nThis entry was posted in Old Lean Dude and tagged change over, GBMP, hoshin kanri, inventory, kaizen, lean assessment, lean development, lean government, lean in healthcare, lean manufacturing, lean summit, lean thinking, lean tools, made in america, muda, mura, Muri, Northeast Shingo Prize, optimization, poka-yoke, process improvement, searching, set-up reduction, shigeo shingo, six sigma, SMED, standardized work, Toast Kaizen, toyota production system, TPM, TPS, true north, value stream mapping on June 4, 2012 by GBMP.\n\u201cI am one with the weeds,\u201d Menrika commented jokingly while we were working together on an improvement project. She was referring to the nitty-gritty realities that present themselves to us when we are that close to the ground. The expression typically refers to getting too tangled up in details. But while it can be argued that a broad perspective may not be achievable from the \u2018weeds,\u2019 I think there are too few kaizen leaders who spend enough time there. Menrika\u2019s comment reminded me of a few lessons I learned from my Dad when I was a tot \u2013 maybe 7.\n\u201cFunny,\u201d I thought, \u201cthe lawn looks so much different at knee level.\u201d There were stones and mold and bare spots and insects \u2014 all sorts of different problems that were only visible when, as Menrika would say, I was one with the weeds.\n\u201cBut why do you use the frame for weeding?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cSo when do you think we\u2019ll be done with this job?\u201d I asked.\nThis entry was posted in Old Lean Dude and tagged GBMP, hoshin kanri, inventory, kaizen, lean assessment, lean development, lean government, lean in healthcare, lean manufacturing, lean summit, lean thinking, lean tools, made in america, muda, mura, Muri, Northeast Shingo Prize, optimization, poka-yoke, process improvement, searching, set-up reduction, shigeo shingo, six sigma, standardized work, Toast Kaizen, toyota production system, TPM, TPS, true north, value stream mapping on April 24, 2012 by GBMP.\n3P, \u201cProduction Preparation Process,\u201d is a method introduced to the US in the mid-80\u2019s by Chihiro Nakao, a contemporary of Mr. Ohno, and founder of Shingijutsu consulting. I recall the method was called \u201cNew Production Preparation\u201d (NPP) early along, but apparently succumbed to a marketing intervention, hence 3P. The basic idea of 3P is to achieve, in Mr. Nakao\u2019s words, \u201cbreakthrough or transformational changes in production process\u201d through rapid, integrated prototyping of both product and process.\nI had a 3P experience recently that reminded me how much I learn from customers. My inspiration occurred during a \u201cmini-event\u201d to develop a build-out addition to a surgery center. The decision to use a 3P approach to develop a better floor layout was made pretty late in the process. We had one week to investigate the current condition and understand design requirements. Then, we began, a team of eight clinicians \u2013 docs, nurses, techs and housekeepers \u2014 to \u201ctrystorm\u201d, a term connoting brainstorming activity combined with actual doing. The first of Mr. Nakao\u2019s \u201c16 Catch Phrases\u201d advocates minimal pre-planning and \u201clightning fast\u201d prototyping, a criteria we closely followed: the event lasted 1\u00bd days.\nMost of the 3P team had minimal previous exposure to Lean concepts. But all were very passionate about patient care and \u201cconstructively dissatisfied\u201d (a theme I take up in GBMP\u2019s DVD Moments of Truth) with the status quo at the surgery center: Bed shortages in the recovery area, ORs waiting for available beds in recovery, surgeons waiting for ORs and, of course, patients waiting for everything.\nWhen I introduced the concept of \u201cpatient-centered\u201d healthcare from a Lean perspective, a connection between passion and principle occurred \u2013 not a perfect understanding, more a fuzzy idea that focusing on the care from the patient\u2019s point of view might yield a breakthrough. By the end of the first day (actually half-day), there was consensus regarding the status quo and a first pass concept for improvement. We agreed to \u201csleep on it.\u201d This, I have found is a very important, if not scheduled, part of the 3P process.\nOn day two we jumped into trystorming with a vengeance. One participant advised that she\u2019d awakened at 2:00 a.m. with a thought. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat we might not come up with a better layout.\u201d she replied. Nervous laughter. We trudged on with a concept that was based upon \u201cadjacencies,\u201d a word that connotes relative locations of departments to facilitate workflow. I reminded the team to focus on patient flow, and placed a couple Lego people on the prototype layout to signify the patient and his family. As we broke for lunch, there was a feeling within the team that the trystorm layout created so far would not be a breakthrough. We were facing a 4:00 p.m. deadline for a solution, and CHI-E was kicking in.\nDo you have a 3P experience you can share? Please send it along.\nBTW: Speaking of principle-based transformation, there\u2019s still time to register for the fast-approaching International Shingo Conference in Jacksonville, April 30 \u2013 May 4. I\u2019ll be there, and hope to see you too.\nThis entry was posted in Old Lean Dude and tagged GBMP, hoshin kanri, inventory, kaizen, lean assessment, lean development, lean government, lean in healthcare, lean manufacturing, lean summit, lean thinking, lean tools, made in america, muda, mura, Muri, Northeast Shingo Prize, optimization, poka-yoke, process improvement, searching, set-up reduction, shigeo shingo, six sigma, standardized work, Toast Kaizen, toyota production system, TPM, TPS, true north, value stream mapping on April 19, 2012 by GBMP.\nI take my work very seriously, but sometimes when I have excess idle time (like on the red-eye from Phoenix to Boston), I\u2019ll have a whimsical idea. Here\u2019s one I\u2019d like to share, to demonstrate the universality of a good idea. My stream of thought begins with recent participation in the Boy Scouts Merit Badge University. As a counselor for music merit badge, I attended a course for their \u201cnew\u201d training method, referred as the EDGE method. I noticed that it bore a striking resemblance to the methods used during World War II to backfill and rapidly train workers in US plants. The same method subsequently was used to help the Japanese manufacturing economy rebound after the war. And today it is experiencing resurgence on US shores, helping to standardize and improve operations in many industries. Most recently, it appears to have made it into the latest edition of the Boy Scouts Handbook. Hurrah for the Scouts, an organization from whom I think I learned more that I did from college. I suppose there is a TWI\u2019er in Scouting today who had the foresight to pass this thinking along. I can only hope that as scouts grow into business people, that EDGE will eventually become their means for training employees.\nExplain how it is done \u2013 Tell them.\nGuide learners as they practice \u2013 Watch them do it.\nEnable them to succeed on their own \u2013 Use memory aids, practice it, they teach it.\n(4) Follows up to provide feedback and help.\nCould it be that that the creators of TWI were Stooges fans?\nThis entry was posted in Old Lean Dude and tagged GBMP, hoshin kanri, inventory, kaizen, lean assessment, lean development, lean government, lean in healthcare, lean manufacturing, lean summit, lean thinking, lean tools, made in america, muda, mura, Muri, Northeast Shingo Prize, optimization, poka-yoke, process improvement, searching, set-up reduction, shigeo shingo, six sigma, standardized work, Toast Kaizen, toyota production system, TPM, TPS, true north, value stream mapping on April 6, 2012 by GBMP.\nWith the International Shingo Prize Conference just a month away, I thought a short post about Shigeo Shingo and the Prize named in his honor would be worthwhile. At the time of Prize\u2019s founding in 1988, Shingo was nearly an unknown in the U.S. His first book translated into English (1969, Japanese Management Association) was hard to understand, reading like a 1960\u2019s instruction manual for a Japan-manufactured product. This was my introduction to Set-up reduction and source inspection (or \u201cprevent-type mistake-proofing) techniques. Shingo\u2019s amazing technical discoveries are credited with making just-in-time possible. Today while Shingo\u2019s original book, the Green Book, is out of print, replaced by a slicker, more readable version, the techniques he first described in English forty years ago, SMED and Poka-Yoke, have become part of our manufacturing lexicon.\nBut one of Shingo\u2019s most important contributions from the green book is often overlooked or even refuted: The concept of production as a network of process and operation. In this network, process is visualized as the flow of objects of change on one axis, and agents of change on another axis. The agents are the operators and machines that add value. The objects are the various parts that are converted from raw materials to finished goods. For those in healthcare, note that \u201cparts\u201d can be replaced conceptually by \u201cpatients\u2019, and \u201coperators\u201d can be replaced by \u201cproviders\u201d (e.g. docs, nurses, etc.) In Shigeo Shingo\u2019s world, production does not refer only to manufacturing, but to any process-operation network. The concept of waste is the same, in his words, whether you are \u201cmaking rice cakes or automobiles.\u201d And where do we find nearly all of this waste? On the process axis \u2014 from the view of the part (or patient.) When we speak of \u201cprocess improvement\u201d we are referring to the process axis of Dr. Shingo\u2019s network.\nThis conventional definition spills over into cost accounting implying that if all operations for a particular process are improved by say 50%, then there will be a 50% process improvement. Consider for example that standard costs are based on roll-ups of operational cost (value-added) plus a large fudge factor based upon average allocation of overhead costs (non-value-added) which, in a circular way, are stated as a multiplier of the value-added time. This is nonsense. Operational times are scrutinized and measured often to four decimal places, while process is essentially invisible in this conventional model. Make versus buy decisions are made by evaluating only a small fraction of total cost. System Efficiency is viewed as a sum over local efficiencies. More nonsense.\nThe English language can be confounding. Those who prefer Meriam-Webster\u2019s definition of process to Dr. Shingo\u2019s will never gain the benefits of Lean. How important is Shingo\u2019s Network? What do you think? Share a story.\nBTW: Looking for another kind of Shingo Network? Come join me and GBMP at the International Shingo Conference in Jacksonville, Florida, April 30-May 4. Hope to see you there.\nThis entry was posted in Old Lean Dude and tagged GBMP, hoshin kanri, inventory, kaizen, lean assessment, lean development, lean government, lean in healthcare, lean manufacturing, lean summit, lean thinking, lean tools, made in america, muda, mura, Muri, Northeast Shingo Prize, optimization, poka-yoke, process improvement, searching, set-up reduction, shigeo shingo, six sigma, standardized work, Toast Kaizen, toyota production system, TPM, TPS, true north, value stream mapping on March 30, 2012 by GBMP.",

    "text": "KAHULUI \u2013 As federal energy officials wrap up a statewide listening tour of sorts this week on potential environmental impacts of achieving Hawaii\u2019s ambitious clean-energy goals, Maui County residents are hopeful their staunch opposition to \u201cBig Wind\u201d has been made clear.\nSome Lanai and Molokai residents have attended all six meetings held so far.\nRepresentatives with the U.S. Department of Energy, the federal Bureau of Offshore Energy Management and the state\u2019s Energy Office held public scoping meetings this week on Maui, Lanai and Molokai, following meetings on Oahu, Kauai and the Big Island.\nThe goal of the meetings was to gain public input on potential impacts of a range of technologies that will be considered to help the state reach a goal of 70 percent clean energy by the year 2030 as spelled out in the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. Of that 70 percent, 40 percent will come from renewable energy production, and 30 percent from energy efficiency.\nThe U.S. Energy Department will be preparing a so-called \u201cprogrammatic\u201d environmental impact statement for the initiative to help guide future federal funding decisions.\nThe department in 2010 started the process, but focused only on plans to develop wind farms on Molokai and Lanai, and to lay an undersea cable to send the power to Oahu.\nBased in part on feedback from scoping meetings on that plan, the department has revised and expanded the scope of the so-called PEIS to include additional clean energy categories. The review will now look at five broad areas: energy efficiency, distributed renewables, utility-scale renewables, alternative transportation fuels and modes, and electrical transmission and distribution.\nNo specific projects or sites are being proposed at this stage, said Jane Summerson, who is spearheading the review for the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\u201cWe need to describe the potential affected environments on an island-by-island basis\u201d in the PEIS, Summerson said.\nShe cited such examples as recreational areas, hunting, fishing or subsistence areas, and traditional cultural sites that could be affected.\n\u201cAnything that helps to characterize your island, your community, the affected environment in a way that could potentially be impacted by one of these technologies,\u201d she said.\nSummerson said that information will then be used to analyze impacts and to identify potential mitigation measures that she said could be required during construction, operation or decommissioning of projects.\nA court reporter attended the meetings to log oral comments for the PEIS.\nShe said she does believe renewable energy is important for Hawaii\u2019s future, but that less invasive technologies should be considered.\n\u201cThe land can\u2019t speak for itself,\u201d Pellegrino said.\nKaye with Friends of Lanai said many of those who spoke on Lanai gave comments in Hawaiian. He said one person sang a song in Hawaiian about the uniqueness of the area where the massive windmills have been proposed, while another shared legends of sites that could be impacted.\nLester Wong, with the group Kupaa no Lanai, said the Lanai wind farm would cut off access to areas that residents regularly use for hunting, fishing and recreation.\nHe said the area currently is open for hunting 24 weeks out of the year.\n\u201cIf these windmills are to be built on that side, I can\u2019t see that happening anymore,\u201d said Wong, who retired from the Maui Police Department as commander for the Lanai patrol district.\nDoug McLeod, energy administrator for Maui County, said he sees the revised scope of the review as a move in the right direction because it moves away from the \u201cnarrow solution\u201d of developing wind farms on Molokai and Lanai.\nBut, McLeod questioned why community opposition has not been a factor in reviewing projects under the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative. He cited concerns on behalf of Mayor Alan Arakawa about a failure to consider community acceptance and benefits in the PEIS approach.\nKanohowailuku Helm \u2013 founder of the community group I Aloha Molokai, which was formed to oppose a proposed wind farm for Molokai \u2013 said three surveys of island residents have been done.\nGlick, the state\u2019s energy administrator, said at the Lanai meeting that if there were \u201coverwhelming opposition\u201d by a community toward a specific energy project, the state would not want to see it happen.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy will accept public comments until Oct. 9 to be used in completing the draft PEIS. Summerson said the department expects to issue a draft PEIS in 2013 and a final document in 2014.\n* Mail: Jim Spaeth, U.S. Department of Energy, 300 Ala Moana Blvd., P.O.

    "text": "Going to look at a 2005 vectra cdti Sri 150 at the weekend, and just wondering if there are any common problems I should be looking for (and how to spot them!). I seem to remember something about 'swirl pots', but to be honest don't know what they are or what I'd be looking for. Any advice greatfully received. Many thanks.\nBest advice...Dont buy one! stick to a petrol, it will cost you less in the long run.\nMaybe a bit of good advice there! I do love the way diesels drive especially the v6 but am dreading anything going wrong with her as they say they are expensive to fix. Diesel used to be cheap once over not now!\nI own one ..... I wouldn't get another older one, half of it newer than when I bought it!\nMaybe one of the later ones if the price was right .... But I'd still have a reserve pot for things like the DMF etc.\nShame because when it is running I love it.\nAhh, not quite the advice I was expecting. Well, that's me thoroughly put off! My other thought was to spend more and get an Insignia SRI, although again I'd be looking at diesel. Hopefully the newer design would be more reliable?!\nNext we have the EGR valve which is a \u00a3100 replacement or a freebie clean up grease and replace.\nFinal one is again very common to every new gen diesel that is the dual mass flywheel clutch and slave. This is a biggie and can run about \u00a31000 but many have had theirs done for about \u00a3600 all in ans some do it themselves for about \u00a3400.\nLuck of the draw with them ..... Have a look around some have run like a dream for thousands of miles, however the common faults are expensive, if the car you have been looking at has had the work ..... Maybe worth it?\nDef check on inlet manifold, clutch dmf and give it a good run looking for judders from engine and knocks from bushes and springs ...... What I can think of to look more in depth at on the cdti apart from the norms.\nmy Cdti V6 runs like a dream.Its a very responsive car and get 40+ to the gallon,not bad for a 3.0 V6. As with any modern car if they fail they can cost money its not just Vectras.Make sure you get one that has a good history, lowest miles and owners possible.\nGo for it mate..the 1.9cdti is as reliable as any other car out there..the forums are here for peoople with interest in the car's and also alot of people asking for advise with problems..look at the bmw/audi/merc's/fords/ etc etc forums,there full of problems also,thats what there here for.And also look at why company's buy them for fleet vehicles,there mile munchers with low cost problems,why else would they buy them if they cost them a fortune to maintain..There is always a risk that you buy a lemon as with any car..good luck,but i recommend the 1.9cdti 07 plate onwards as i have one with no probs so far..TOUCH WOOD lol.\nVectra 1.9 CDTi buying advice..\nLooking at buying a 3.0V6 CDTi:Advice please!!!",

    "text": "Which event do you think will come out a winner or loser tomorrow Sunday July 15, 2018. The one and only Pacquiao or INC Lingap? Well, how does the boxing world feel about the great Pacman?\n\u201cManny Pacquiao will step into a boxing ring for the 69th time as a professional on Saturday night when he faces hard-hitting Lucas Matthysse at the Axiata Arena in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As he approaches the age of 40, the fighter who was once considered the greatest boxer on the planet has watched the reflection of his finest years as a pugilist grow smaller and smaller in his rearview mirror until they are almost unrecognizable.\nNevertheless, he\u2019ll step between the ropes again for reasons that appear to be clearly financially driven against Matthysse. It wasn\u2019t long ago that any fight involving Pacquio would invariably be a PPV attraction. His bout against Matthysse will be streamed on ESPN+, which seems like a pretty steep falloff for a man who was involved in the biggest pay-per-view of all time just three years ago when he lost a unanimous decision to Floyd Mayweather Jr.\nYou can read more about that fight here .\nAnd how about the INC Lingap? The Manila Times put out a story of this activity scheduled also for July 15, 2018.\n\u201cThe Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) is set to hold a massive anti-poverty program under its Lingap sa Mamamayan (Lingap) project on July 15.\nAround 150,000 people are expected to participate in the activity to be held at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila as \u201cpart of the Church\u2019s resolve to do something concrete to combat poverty [in the country]and around the world,\u201d according to INC general auditor Glicerio Santos Jr.\nThe vision is perfect, almost anyway. A homegrown church with a membership of shall we say 5 million feeding and treating the needs of the rest of the world reaching as far as the continent of Africa. But come to think of it, how does the King secure the logistics for such an event. Easy, require all the locales to donate their share in the event through kind or equivalent money. There is also the Tanging Handugan or Special Offerings. The membership solely shoulders the expenses. Ministers? No they do not. Not even the King. WE the members support them, from the food they eat to the lavish lifestyles they support. And what verse do they show to support this?\nMaybe we should have been content with that one glass of water. Doesn\u2019t it say in the bible that we should \u201cnot add or take away\u201d? So maybe it should have been only one glass, no more no less. Anyway, back to the subject.\nCurious though is the insistence of the King to hold it at the Quirino Grandstand. Wouldn\u2019t it have been global in a sense if it had been held simultaneously in different locales all over the Philippines? Much more practical too. The working brethren would not have a difficult time to participate since it is being conducted at their own locale. Every province and city would also have benefited then. Not like the proposed Luneta venue. Buses will be rented to ferry the visitors from their locales to the venue, then they will have to be brought back to their locales. The accompanying brethren will have to manage breakfast and lunch for their visitors and themselves because this is not included in the Lingap. Beneficiaries to the event would be limited.\nDidn\u2019t the King\u2019s crooked knights foresee this? Of course they did. The problem here is publicity. No media coverage if done at the locales. The kingdom needs publicity, to present an image of godliness, compassion, and love towards its fellowmen. And there\u2019s the Guinness to consider, right? But the way I see it, the King needs assurance that he is still in control and is subtly showing our political friends that he is still a force to be reckoned with come election year and that is next year \u2013 National and Local elections. Up for grabs is the position of Senator, Congressman, Mayor, Vice-Mayor, etc. Easy money as they say, for the King and his Knights of the crooked table and some crumbs for Frank the pugs. Well, how can you blame them with all the mortgaged church properties nearing remata.\nKa Tacio wala akong FB.Ang totoo kaya lang ako nakasusulat dito ang anak ko ang nag set up nitong laptop na giangamit ko.Sad to say wala akong gaanong alam sa makabagong teknolohiya ngayon. Malayo sa akin ang anak ko.nxt time mag meet kami patuturo ako kahit sa FB. Ka Shane Michael,TAMA ka,Hindi ako si Jesus at ang mga Character na binanggit ko na NAGTAGO ngunit di kahulugan ay DUWAG,Sagot ko yan kay Coward Like you na sabi bakit AKO NAGTATAGO? Gaya ng sabi ko \u201cmarami na akong hinarap na MT at maging mga \u201cministro\u201d,HINDI nila MASAGOT at MASIRA ang Paninindigan ko sa panig ng KATOTOHANAN\u2013\u201csila\u201d ang mga AYAW na akong Kausapin at Dalawin,sino ngayon ang DUWAG sa Katotohahan,\u201dsila\u201d o AKO? Kung nagtatago man akong sa pangalang bibliko,hindi dahil TAKOT akong matiwalag,ayoko muna dahil sa paminsan-minsan na \u201cnakasasamba pa ako\u201d NALALAMAN ko kung anong mga TURO at ARAL ang Binabaluktot o Pinipilipit \u201cnila\u201d para ILIGAW ang mga kapatid na walang Malay!!Hindi ako PERPEKTO,may mga pagkakataong MALI ako,ngunit sinisikap ko na kung MAGAGAMIT ko ang mga TALATA sa BIBLIA,ginagamit ko,sapagkat ITO,(mga Salita ng DIOS) ang PINAKAMABISA na Panlaban sa Lahat ng Kasinungalingan at Maling Aral o Turo sa KANINOMANG \u201cnangangaral ng Ebanghelyo\u201d.!! Tama ka rin ka Lost Sheep,ngunit kung HAYAG ang kasamaang ginagawa at napatunayan,HUMAHATOL ka ba o kung HINATULAN mo,mali ba yon! Halimbawa,yung mga \u201ckapatid\u201d na pumatay kay Mayor Bote\u2013 sinabi ko mga MAMATAY TAO kayo,kakahiya kayo,(INC) pa naman kayo. Nang sabhin kong Kriminal sila,mali ba yung pagsasalita kong iyon na PAGHATOL sa kanilang karakter? Gaya ng nasa JUAN 7:24 Huag kayong MAGSIHATOL ayon sa anyo,kundi MAGSIHATOL kayo ng MATUWID na Paghatol!! Samakatuwid,pued kang humatol BASTA Matuwid na paghatol. Isa pang halimbawa: Nahuli kang Nagnanakaw sa akto,sinabihan ka o hinatulan ka ng mga tao o kapitbahay mo \u201cMagnanakaw ka\u201d,kasalanan ba yun?Di ba hinatulan mo yung tao ayon sa MALI niyang ginawa,kaya ang tawag na sa kanya Magnanakaw,di ba?\nHeto pa ang isang magandang Halimbawa sa PAGHATOL\u2013 alam natin ang EVM church mga SINUNGALING at mga DUWAG sa panig ng Katotohanan,diba? Kung sabihin ko na HINDI sila ligtas.mali ba yun? Ang sabi sa APOC. 21:8 ang DUWAG at SINUNGALING sa dagat-dagatang Apoy mapupunta!! Sinuway mo ang TUNAY na PAMAMAHALA na Ibinigay/ipinagkaloob sa ka EGM,LIGTAS ka ba? Si EVM hindi tunay na TP,ALAM halos ng Lahat pati na yang Sangoons na yan,INUTUSAN sila ni ka ERDY na \u201cmaghalal na Papalit sa KANIYA\u201d pero di nila Sinunod.Kung sinabi kong Peke is EVM(paghatol) nagkasala ba ako,gayung TOTOO naman na ito ang Habilin ng ka EGM sa \u201csanggunian sa Pamumuno ni J$\u201d na magkaroon ng Halalan para pumalit sa ka EGM,tapos PUMUESTO si EVM,di ba PEKE siyang TP?? Mali ba ang Hatol ko na PEKE siya?\nKa Bible Bot\u2013 Sa Hebreo 1:8 malinaw ang nakasulat\u2013 But as to the Son,He says,GOD is Thy throne forever and forever\u2026then 0n 9 it says \u2013Thou has loved righteousness,and hated iniquities,therefore GOD,Thy GOD \u201cannointed thee\u201d. Nothing in these verse Proved that Christ was/is GOD!! If Christ is God as belief by others and using these verses,HOW COME He(Christ) was Annointed by GOD? It is very clear GOD was the ONE who annointed Christ,not God annointed (another) God,Right? On Colosians 2:9 it says\u2014 For in Him(Christ) dwelleth all the fulness of Godhead bodily. Does it means Christ is GOD because God dwells in Him? If he(Christ) is God in this Verse,WHO is the GOD that Dwells on HIM? So there will be 2 Gods if we will accept that becoz God dwells on Christ,christ is also God?How About Moses n others Prophets? God was with Moses too.God was with Elijah too and annointed them with the H.Spirit.ARE THEY GODS? Christ divine nature DOES NOT proved or Proof that He is GOD. God is Holy,Christ is Holy,God is Truth,Christ is Truth,God is Life and Christ is Life\u2013It only shows that SOME qualities of GOD,Christ Have,but it doesn\u2019t mean he is God.The truth God says,YOU(pertaining to all mankind) must be HOLY,because I AM HOLY!!When God Created Mankind it was for their Holiness,but bacause our LOLO n LOLA Adan n Eba,Disobeyed GOD,we INHERIT their Characters\u2013DISOBEDIENT to GOD!! Do you know that the true Christians are Holy? That was proclaimed by apostle Paul and the HOLY SPIRIT DWELL in us,he said You are the Temple of the Holy Spirit!! Are we God becoz the H.Spirit and God dwells in us if we lived a Life of righteousness n holiness? In John 10:30 Christ and the Father are ONE in taking care of the Sheep or their people not in NATURE,Just read verses 27-29,then 30.Is what our Lord JesusChrist proclamation in John 17:1,3 is not ENOUGH PROOF that He is not God? He was praying at the Father and says ,THIS is ETERNAL Life,that they may KNOW \u201cYOU,the ONLY TRUE GOD\u201d.!! Just asked anyone who believed that Christ is GOD like this,Is our Lord JC telling the TRUTH when He said that the ONLY true GOD is the Father.And asked them too,WHOM I am going to BELIEVED,you or our Lord JesusChrist? Very simple questions that those who believed that Christ is God, CANNOT answer!!\nThe point about Col 2:9 is that the New World Translation states \u201cthe fullness of the divine quality resides in bodily form\u201d means this is used as an adjective just like John 1:1 Moffatt states \u201cthe Word was divine\u201d Revised English Version states \u201cthe fullness of what God was resides in bodily form\u201d and \u201cthe Word was what God was\u201c are both adjectives. The Godhead is not a divine being but rather the qualities of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. John 10:29 and John 14:28 Jesus even states the Father is greater. REV is the only truly Unitarian bible.\nThink of a system, family or partnership united.\nThere is a right end Unitarian sect that believes the Father is true God but recognizes the Godhead as a unity of God, Jesus and Holy Spirit.\nMga kapatid,sa tagal ko ng nagbabasa ng Biblia,may ISANG talata akong nabasa na,ITO lang talatang ito,SIRA na ang paniniwala NINOMAN na Dios ang Cristo.Marami silang mababasa na kung ano-anong pangontra sa mga talata na binabasa natin para patunayan na si Cristo ay Dios din.Ngunit itong nasa Deuteronomio na nabasa ko noon pa,HINDI nila matutulan at di aayon sa paniniwala nila na Dios ang Cristo.Heto mga kapatid sa 32:39 ng Deut. heto ang nakasulat: Tingnan ninyo ngayon,na AKO,samakatuwid baga\u2019y AKO nga,At walang dios sa AKIN:AKO\u2019Y\u201d pumapatay\u201d,at AKO\u2019Y\u201d bumubuhay\u201d,AKO\u2019Y\u201d sumusugat\u201d,at AKO\u2019Y \u201cnagpapagaling\u201d;at walang makakaligtas sa Aking kamay. Heto ang mga TANONG na dapat itanong sa naniniwalang si Cristo ay Dios? Si Cristo Bumuhay ng patay at Nagpapagaling,ngunit SAAN MABABASA na si CRISTO pumatay ng tao,nagbigay ng karamdaman o may sinugatan na tao? Kapag may nabasa kayo(tanong mo sa kausap mo) na si Cristo pumatay at nanugat o nagbigay karamdaman sa kaninomang TAO,tatanggapin ko na Dios si Cristo!!\nGawin mo nang six months bro. Biro lang ha\u2026Daniel Matsunaga\u2019s gonna miss you more.\nBro. WS, it\u2019s been two weeks now since your last post. Anything new?\nWhat\u2019s new? At least if bibliko is around he shall make sure this blog remains active.\nAs another instance of the eerie resemblance of the INC saga and Trump\u2019s presidency, I just saw this article after googling \u201cCNN breaking news\u201d: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-acosta-anti-media-trump_us_5b61415fe4b0b15aba9dcc10. CNN\u2019s Senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta, is \u201cvery worried that the hostility whipped up by Trump and some in the conservative media will result in somebody getting hurt\u201d. Sadly, in our case, the hostility whipped up by EVM and his ministers, especially in their worship service sermons (\u201cpuksain mo sila\u201d) already resulted in, at least, 4 violent deaths (Fruto, Villocino, Ledesma, Patungan). And the climate of fear still persists within the church as EVM lords it over with his \u201c obey and never complain\u201d mantra. In reality though, the true INC members who have decided to stay are not really afraid but are just patiently waiting for EVM to be replaced and the church to be restored to its pristine condition through divine intervention.\nHi Brethren,I\u2019m back.Thanks sa pag-aalala nyo sa travel ko.I have to work tonite.Just got home this morning. Salamat sa inyong lahat.Happy to be back!!\nThank you bros, you are back. I thought we\u2019ll still wait for another article from bro. WS before we can have an exchange of views again. I like the analogy you presented bro. Filosofo Tacio about Trump\u2019s and EVM\u2019s administration. Indeed, they really share a lot of of strategies in common. Strategies that suppress the rights of people and stay in power to be in control of many lives. In our case, the rights of brethrens. How I wish for the day to come so soon when the Church will go back to its pristine state, unblemished and pure for the glory of God!\nMay nagbalita sa akin na ang webek sa lokal ng Hawaii ay NAUDLOT dahil nag-Brown-Out!! Nawalan ng electricity dahil \u201cwalang pa palang permit\u201d na nakuha para sa okasyon ng ihandog ang kapilya.Balita rin na \u201clahat ng mga maytungkulin at mga ministro\u201d ay INALISAN ng mga karapatan dahil sa pangyayaring iyon.Okey lang na Pumalpak sila kasi balita HINDI pa Kumpleto ang KAYARIAN ng Kapilya eh inihandog na agad!! Ganyan pala ngayon,kahit di pa AYOS lahat ang kaayusan ng isang kapilya,INIHAHANDOG na pilit para may Maipagyabang sila na may \u201cbagong kapilya\u201d na naihandog.!! KAILAN sa panahon ng ka EGM nangyari ang ganyan?,WALA,wala kahit Isa,ngayon sige lang \u201cbasta may maipagyabang na inihandog na kapilya\u201d ok lang kahit may KAPINTASAN.!! Ang isa pang kaipokritahan ng mga ito,ang mga ipinakikitang kapilya sa TV ay karamihan yung magaganda kahit panahon pa ng ka EGM.WALANG ipakita na mga Baranggay Kapilyates at mga Kapilya na bulok na at hindi maipagawa na nasa mga probinsya.Mga kapilya na halos sinlalaki lang ng mga garahe at walang kaayusan,ITINATAGO at INILILIHIM sa publiko at mga kapatid.!! Napanood nyo ba yung episode 14 nila Miguel? Tinanggal si BOB \u201cbig fat liar\u201d ah,mukhang napagalitan he he he..ipinalit kapatid ni ka Jon Dizon.May Drama pa sila sa huli pati na si Miguel na akala mo sincero sa pagsasalita na gustong \u201cmagpaiyak\u201d.Hanga ako sa mga ito,sanay na sanay ng \u201cmagsi-arte\u201d sa harap ng telebisyon,sanay \u201cmanghamak\u201d ng kapuwa.Tama si bro.Edge,ano ang masama sa isang ministro na magtinda ng tubig sa \u201cmalinis na paraan ng paghahanap-buhay\u201d kesa NAKIKINABANG sila(mga OWE/STF) sa NAKAW na abuloy at Handugan na ukol para sa AMA.Mga ministro ang mga ito sa TV pa man din,nanghahamak ng kapuwa dahil Nagtitinda lang ng Tubig? Paano yung mga kapatid na basurero at street Vendor\u2013hahamakin din nila? Ganyan na ang ASAL ng mga ministro ng EVM church,mga Mapagmataas.Mayayabang at Mapanghamak ng kapuwa-Tao!! Ang lalakas ng loob magsabi na \u201ckami ang tunay na defender of Faith\u201d? sabi nga kapal Muks nyo,wala na kayong HIYA.!!\nMarami pa akong mga kaibigang kapatid na Silent Defender at sabi nga nila,alam namin na maraming maling nagyayari sa Iglesia.Lagi nilang sinasabi na,basta dito na lang muna kami,hihintay na lang kung kailan ito(ang Iglesia) ibalik sa dating kalagayan na matuwid. Ang kakatuwa sa mga karamihan sa kanila,sumasamba sila pero di naman daw nila iniintindi ang itinuturo dahil paulit-ulit lang at parang sirang plaka.Ayoko lang silang hiyain,GUSTO kong sabihin sa kanila,Bakit sumasamba ka pa,di ka naman pala nakikinig? Nag-aabuloy ka at naghahahndog at naglalagak sa pasalamat,di NAKIKIISA ka pa rin sa mga LIDER? Alam nilang/mong MALI bakit nanjan ka pa? Di ba isang kalokohan o kamalian iyong alam di ayos/tama pero nanjan ka?Lalo na ang iba at may Tungkulin pa\u2013Napipilitan o Natatakot na HINDI sumama sa mga Aktibidad,kalayawan man o kabanalan na matatawag-di nakikiisa ka pa rinsa EVM Church? Paano kang naging \u201cdefender\u201d di ka kumikibo o nagsasalita ng katotohanan? Kung babalikan Aral natin ang mga IBINUBUKOD ng Dios na ILILIGTAS NIYA,either IBUBUKOD Niya o PAALISIN sa dakong pupuksain o gugunawin ng Dios.Tulad ni Noe\u2013pinasakay sa DAONG.Si Lot at Pamilya PINAALIS sa Sodom at Gomora.Ang unang Bayan kailangan KASAMA ka ni Abraham at ng Bayang Israel na pinamahalaaan ni Moses.Ang Unang INC dapat KAANIB ka dito at ng sumama ang mga LIDER,sabi ng Dios\u2013LUMABAS ka sa Kanya BAYAN ko ng HINDI ka madamay sa SALOT na gagawin ng Dios(ito nga ang unang Babilonia-ICAR na ngayon). Kaya AYWAN ko,kung papaano kang maliligtas kahit Silent Defender ka pero NANJAN ka kay EVM.HINDI ka naghahayag ng mga Kamaliang ginagawa nila,bagkus TAKOT kang magsalita at natatakot o napipilitan ka pang sumunod sa takot mo na matiwalag at itakwil ka ng mga mahal mo sa buhay o mga kaibigan at kakilala mong kapatid na puro Bulag na at Panatiko,di ba? Ito lang ang masasabi ko ukol sa mga nananatili at naghihintay ng pagbabago.Papaano kung iyon palang mga tiniwalag nila at kusang humiwalay na ay PAGBUBUKOD na pala ng AMA? Sino ngayon ang Ligtas at di Ligtas?IIWAN ko na sa inyo mga kasagutan Bro.!!\nTotoo ba mga Bro. na ang mga SCAN,mga Nakasuot na lang ng Barong shirt o polo barong dahil \u201cmaganda ang Imahe\u201d nila sa buong mundo dahil \u201cmababait sila\u201d at walang sangkot sa anomang mga krimen at anomalya? Balita eh \u201cbinawi na lahat ng UNIPORME nila at isang mataas na Opisyal sa Sangoons at inatasan ukol dito? Nagtatanong lang po.\nPansamantala lang iyan at ibabalik din sa kanila ang mga uniporme. Gusto ng Opisyal na iyon na ma-SCAN ang bawat uniporme kung alin ang amoy Defenders.\nkasi po sumabog na ang balitang pangulo ng SCAN ang tumira ky mayor Bote. In fairness, personal na away nila ng mayor yun dahil sa property or business.",

    "text": "Researchers at King\u2019s College London are translating research on eating disorders during pregnancy and motherhood into practical training resources, helping healthcare professionals provide the best care for pregnant women and mothers. Launching today at the start of Eating Disorders Awareness Week 2018, the resources include an animation co-designed by the research team, women with lived experience, healthcare professionals and key organisations.\nCurrently there are very limited resources available for healthcare professionals, despite previous research finding that approximately 7.5% of women may be suffering from an eating disorder during pregnancy. The animation aims to raise awareness that eating disorders are serious mental illnesses that can impact on pregnancy and beyond, and highlights the importance of a trusting relationship between women suffering from eating disorders and healthcare professionals.\n\u2018Women with eating disorders are often reluctant to disclose their illness to healthcare professionals, possibly due to a fear of stigma, and healthcare professionals may be unsure about how to identify women with eating disorders or what support they need,\u2019 says Dr Abigail Easter, Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in Improvement Science at King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN).\nRecent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2017) has recommendations for enhanced monitoring and support for women with eating disorders before, during and after pregnancy. However, barriers can exist which prevent healthcare professionals from implementing current NICE guidelines in practice.\nThe animation will be will be hosted online at eatingdisordersandpregnancy.co.uk alongside additional training resources, and will be presented at a training event at the IoPPN on Tuesday 27th March. The project was funded through the Health Foundation\u2019s Evidence into Practice programme, and Dr Easter is supported by King\u2019s Improvement Science, part of the Centre for Implementation Science within NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) South London.\nThe following charitable organisations have contributed to the development of this animation: Beat, the Institute of Health Visiting, NCT (National Childbirth Trust) and Tommy\u2019s.\nChristina Kelly is married with three children. Christina has struggled with an eating disorder since she was a teenager and had to be admitted to hospital while she was studying at university. Throughout her twenties she sought help through counselling and support groups and managed to live with her eating disorder symptoms.\nIn her late twenties, Christina became pregnant with her first child and quickly found her eating disorder increased in severity. This was the case throughout each of her pregnancies, resulting in inpatient admission to a specialist eating disorder unit during her first and second pregnancy. She struggled with low mood and feelings of guilt and isolation during each pregnancy, struggling to find support that brought together her needs as a pregnant woman, a mother and someone needing support for an eating disorder.\nChristina now works in a mental health crisis service providing peer support to people in distress, working with compassion and using her own experiences to help others.\nTo interview Dr Abigail Easter or Christina Kelly, to view the animation or for further media information, please contact Robin Bisson, Senior Press Officer, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London, robin.bisson@kcl.ac.uk / +44 20 7848 5377 / +44 7718 697176.\nTo interview Caroline Price please contact Daniele Fisichella, Press Officer at Beat on D.fisichella@beateatingdisorders.org.uk / 01603 753 316.\nTo interview Melita Walker please contact Julie Cooper, Communications and Marketing Manager at the Institute of Health Visiting on Julie.Cooper@ihv.org.uk / 07508 344716.",

    "text": "What will Wake Forest\u2019s campus look like in 10 or more years? A master plan is an attempt to answer that and other questions.\nA master plan is an effort to understand current and future needs, not just in terms of buildings, but also in terms of traffic and parking, the environment, green spaces, water sheds, utilities, etc. The thrust of a campus master plan is not to identify individual or departmental space needs. It\u2019s a more broad-based look at the campus. One of the most important things a good plan does is look at the \u201csynergies\u201d between buildings as well as providing for a landscape scheme that knits the buildings together. A good example of that is our \u201cscience quad\u201d where the three science buildings are located close together.\nWhen was the last campus plan developed?\nWake Forest has had only one master plan, the one that Jens Larson developed in the 1950s. It has been updated four times, in 1988, 1991, 2000 and 2009. In each of the earlier updates the focus was more on a specific area of campus or to address specific needs, such as a site for a building, rather than looking at the campus as a whole. The most recent update of the plan was much more comprehensive.\nDid the master planning process include just the campus proper or extend to surrounding areas, such as Polo Road, and even over to Deacon Boulevard?\nThe primary focus of the plan is the Reynolda Campus, not on surrounding properties.\nHow did the process ensure that those with historical knowledge of and appreciation for the campus\u2019 special appeal and environment be heard?\nThe process was very inclusive of the entire campus community. Several open forums were held for the campus community, as well as the local community, to provide input to the plan and to be kept updated as the plan developed. Members of the campus community expressed appreciation of campus traditions, the charm of campus, its residential nature, and the impressive core of campus.\nWhat happens now that the most recent master plan has been completed?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the master plan is not so much one final document as options to consider for the future. Generally a master plan attempts to cover a 20 to 50 year time period in terms of how the campus should develop. So after the master plan is finalized, there will be a shorter term plan that sets priorities to cover five to 10 years. That also means that it is helpful to update a master plan every five to 10 years in order to adapt the plan to changing conditions.",

    "text": "Welcome to the St Joseph directory of In-Home or Residential Senior Care Providers. Residential Senior Care is when a senior lives in their home but has a care provider visit them on a periodic basis to help with daily living activities. Our search feature for St Joseph uses an estimate of the typical service area for Residential Service providers so check with each organization to confirm service in your neighborhood. This directory also includes 44 option for senior care including some community resources that can be helpful in improving the standard of living for a senior who gets their main care at home. These services range from local Missouri non-profits to medical supply companies.\nIn may situations, a St Joseph in-home service provider can be less expensive than an assisted living facility or nursing home. Once you find a possible service, you can click the \"Add To My Personal List\" to build a custom list of Residential In-home senior service providers and community services that you can print. If you are a caretaker for a senior in St Joseph, please share your experience with other St Joseph caregivers by creating a review.\nResults Limited to 44 for download speed reasons.

    "text": "Whilst I am finally loving the way my body feels, now that I am actually getting fitter and healthier, I sometimes have to drag myself to my classes at The Circuit Factory. The aches from the last session, or the tiredness from no sleep, or the huge tub of ice cream I ate last night, all will me to put on my yoga pants and settle down on the sofa with wine and more ice cream.\nSo I've found that there are several essential oils that have the ability to dissolve each and every one of those devils on my shoulder, and make getting to the gym just that little bit easier on my resolve.\nDeep Blue is the ultimate soother for sore and aching muscles after that intense work out. I add it to the bath the following morning and it really helps to soothe all those aches and pain and give my body what it needs to relax and unwind. I also dilute it in coconut or olive oil (it's quite cooling on my skin) and apply it topically to whichever muscle is doing the most complaining.\nIt really helps me to feel more normal, so I don't have to hobble back to the gym (or let those muscles give me an excuse for sitting on the sofa!).\nThere is literally nothing like doing a Circuit Factory class when you're all heavy with the weight of all the crap you've eaten that day. In the past I've often just made excuses and not gone, worried I might actually be sick. Grapefruit essential oil has been great in relieving those sugar cravings, so I am abstaining from the ice cream more often. So I feel lighter, and it doesn't feel like such a drag getting off my backside and going to class.\nI kinda need to breathe when I'm working so hard my lungs want to explode. So the biggest excuse I make for myself is that I can't possibly go to the gym when I've got a little sniffle. I'm not sick, but I can't breathe, so it's not worth it. So I apply Breathe to my chest three times a day, and definitely before class, as it helps to support my respiratory system to clear my airways. I can get to the gym and get on with my day.\nI really want to kiss the person who invented these! After another sleepless night with my two angel babies, the last thing I want to do is go to the gym. I want to conserve my energy for lifting my wine glass and crying at soppy movies. Mito2Max is a great supplement which supports the body's optimum aerobic capacity and supports stamina naturally without the use of stimulants like caffeine.\nWintergreen is great for when you tweak a tendon or a muscle. It's fantastic at supporting the body's natural healing and it supports the body as it tries to reduce inflammation and heal the pull to the muscle. I apply it twice a day to any injuries I pick up.\nDoes this help you with any of your excuses?\nI have been looking for a gluten free cheese cracker recipe for a while. S's favourite snacks are goldfish crackers or mini cheddars. Plus I'm rather partial to them as well! So I wanted to find a gluten free version so that I can indulge, and reduce S's gluten intake a little bit.\nS is a typical toddler, so she won't be fooled by bad knock off versions. If it doesn't taste perfect, she simply won't eat it.\nThat's why I love this gluten free parmesan cracker recipe from Gluten Free on a Shoestring. They don't taste like they are gluten free and they have a great crunch to them.\nI use their \"Mock Better Batter\" flour blend, and I find it works great as a gluten free flour for quite a few of their recipes. We can't get Better Batter flour blend in Dubai or in the UK, so I can't just order it in from Amazon.\nI've started making the dough in large batches and freezing it. I'm not sure if the crackers would retain their crunch if you froze them after baking them. They taste just as good after the dough has been frozen as they do if you make them completely fresh.\nMake sure you roll them out pretty thin though, because otherwise they lose their crunch when you store them. If they are thin, then they stay crispy and crunchy for over two weeks (not that they usually last that long!).\nI tend to use cookie cutters to get interesting shapes, but you could easily just slice the dough up before baking (I'm a bit OCD about wonky crackers, clearly been eating store bought crackers for a long time).\nI've also used normal buttermilk instead of the cultured buttermilk and found that it worked just fine, but the crackers need more cooking so that they are still crunchy.\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius . Line rimmed baking sheets with unbleached parchment paper and set aside.\nIn a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, cornmeal, baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and buttermilk blend, and whisk to combine well. Add the finely grated cheese, and mix to combine. Add the 4 tablespoons butter and the milk, and mix until combined and the dough begins to come together. Divide the dough into two parts, and press each into a small ball. Place the first ball of dough between two sheets of unbleached parchment paper, and roll into a rectangle about 1/8-inch thick (about the thickness of a nickel). The dough should roll out quickly and easily. With a fluted (or simple round) 1-inch cookie cutter, cut out rounds of dough and place them on a prepared baking sheet, about 1-inch apart (they will not spread during baking). Gather and reroll scraps. Repeat with the other half of the dough.\nUsing a toothpick, poke 4 evenly spaced holes toward the center of each of the rounds of dough. Poke the holes in a tight circular motion to create well-rounded holes. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of all of the rounds of dough lightly with the remaining teaspoon of melted butter. One tablespoon of melted butter should be enough to cover all of the rounds lightly. Sprinkle the tops of the rounds liberally with coarse salt.\nPlace the baking sheet in the center of the preheated oven and bake, rotating once during baking, for about 12 minutes, or until the crackers are dark golden brown on the edges and lightly golden brown on top. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet. Store in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. For best results, store at room temperature in a sealed glass container, to maintain crispness.\nIt's funny how life takes you on different twists and turns, many of them were never in the plan, or turned out like you expected.\nFor me, becoming an expat was one of those unexpected twists, and it definitely did not turn out the way I thought it would. As I'm sure I have said before, I have never had this burning desire to live overseas. I wasn't one of those people who was desperate to disappear on a gap year to Australia or the Far East.\nDon't get me wrong, I love my holidays, but permanently immersing myself in another country, I'd never really wanted to. I was more than happy in the UK, and as I chose a career path which was only really applicable in the UK and a handful of other countries (in a previous life I was a lawyer), I hadn't really set myself up for a life abroad.\nBut Gary has always wanted to work overseas. He has made that more than clear from the moment we got together. We discussed it, and discussed it, and discussed it, but as time went on, it slipped further to the back of my mind.\nUntil the offer of a job in Qatar came through.\nI'm usually a bit of a believer in fate, I believe that things seem to click together at the right time. If it feels right, it probably is. With the job in Qatar, it was fairly clear that things were clicking together.\nWe were only three months away from getting married (a prerequisite if I wanted to live with Gary in Qatar). We had already discussed starting a family soon after we were married (necessitating a career break for me). We had already started looking at houses, in readiness to move out of our apartment and start a new chapter.\nWe snuck off to Qatar for the weekend to investigate and we liked what we saw. It was obvious that there would be a culture difference, but English was commonly spoken and there was a large amount of expats living in Qatar, making the transition much smoother.\nThen, less than nine months after we arrived in Qatar, a job came up in Dubai. I was pregnant and getting more and more so each day, and the clock was ticking as to whether we would even be able to get out of Qatar before it was too late for me to fly. I did not fancy an eight hour road trip through Saudi Arabia when nine months pregnant.\nAgain everything seemed to come together so that, in the nick of time, we moved to Dubai. In less than four weeks, we moved countries, found an apartment, found a hospital and had a baby.\nDubai has been the most amazing place for us to have started our family. We had the most amazing care from the hospital for both of our children, and we've had the most amazing opportunity to experience Dubai as a family.\nWe've made some amazing friends. Friends that have become family to me. Friends who all jumped up and offered to look after Miss S while I was in hospital having Mister L. Friends who would happily come over at the crack of dawn to look after the kids if I wasn't well enough.\nThere is something about being expats that has banded us all together. We have leaned on each other much more than we probably would have if we were in the UK with family close by. And that has been such a blessing, as it turns out.\nOne of the hardest things when you are an expat is not having family nearby who can just pop over. And yet my friends have more than made up for that by being so amazing. I feel like we've all changed and grown, but grown together, as our children have grown alongside us.\nI'm not the person I was when I left the UK. Not only have I had the opportunity to meet the most amazing people, I've also had the chance to experience another amazing culture. I knew nothing of Islam before I left the UK (and I'm no whizz at it now!). I had no understanding of the religion, or it's people.\nMy understanding of Islam was limited to what was in the newspapers, along with some limited wider reading. I hadn't realised what a limited view that actually was until I lived in the Middle East. Living in a muslim country has given me a new appreciation for other people's religions, and how to respect those religions. It also gives you a hugely different view on the politics of the Middle East, and on the decisions that are made in rooms far away from here.\nI am a much more worldly person that the one that left the UK four years ago. I feel like I have morphed and changed and expanded (metaphorically, thankfully not physically!). Seeing more of the world, and spending more than a week in one place, has changed my perspective on so many different things.\nIt has also taught me my own strength. It's taught me that I can move house, move country, move continents, without much chaos.\nIt's taught me that I can make friends, can build relationships and bonds with people, again and again and again. And that those friendships might just become some of the most important to me.\nIt's taught me that I can take care of two children while Gary works abroad, for weeks at a time. It has taught me that I can be patient and calm, when there are no reinforcements.\nIt's taught me that I can maintain and even improve relationships with friends and family that are still in the UK. That the miles between us really do mean nothing at all, as long as we love each other, and want to support each other.\nIt's taught me that I can watch friends leave, and smile even when I wanted to cry. To see the bigger picture for not only me, but for others. To see what is best, and to encourage and support their decisions, even if they aren't the decision I'd wish they'd make (for purely selfish reasons).\nI love Dubai, but the time has come to leave it. To leave behind the place where we built our married life together. To leave the apartment that we brought our children home to. To leave the friends who have gotten me through the first tough years of motherhood.\nAs I look around me, I wonder how we will ever do it. To sell or pack up all of our worldly possessions (which have multiplied in four years), and ship them across two continents. I wonder how we'll ever settle into another life, a very different life than the one we are leaving behind.\nI know that we can, and that we will. I know that it will be easy and hard in equal measure. I know I will grieve and rejoice in equal measure, as we begin our new lives. There are so many opportunities lost to us, but so many more that we will gain.\nIt's hard to leave when you aren't fed up of where you are, but then that's also exactly the time to go. Again it feels rather like fate has intervened, there were so many coincidences that happened as we walked towards this decision, towards the new job, new home, new life.\nI will miss Dubai, and all of those amazing people we leave behind. But they have a very special, and very warm place, in my heart. Dubai has made me the person that I am today, and for that, I'm more grateful than I can possibly express.\nI thought we'd avoided the toddler tantrums with S.\nOk, stop laughing..... seriously, stop laughing.\nIn hindsight it was the most ridiculous thing, but as S approached two and a half, and she hadn't really progressed into full meltdown mode, I thought she was just one of those kids who didn't really have them. She had strops now and then, but no hysterics, and she was fairly easy to cajole out of them.\nAt the time, I kept saying \"they'll come\", but to other people. The fact that they really were going to show up didn't really lodge itself in my brain.\nAnd then the world came crashing down with meltdowns and throwing herself on the floor and using the word \"no\" so many times a day I felt like screaming my head off.\nMy particular favourites both revolve around chocolate. First of all there was the time when she asked for ice cream, and then had a meltdown when I opened the ice cream instead of the chocolate I'd bought for baking.... in public, which included lying on a bench for fifteen minutes screaming her head off and crying hysterically.... while I ate most of the ice cream.\nThen there was Valentines day, when she was given chocolate hearts in every shop we went into (in Dubai they give chocolate to children A LOT!), and then had huge hysterics demanding chocolate as though I'd refused to let her have any. Cue a twenty minute crying fit in the double pram while I wandered around and ignored her.\nI am not the most patient. I can pretty much ignore the full blown tantrums, because there isn't really a way to stop them once they've started and it's better for S if we just ride the wave of emotions for a little while and let her sort herself out.\nBut the incessant not listening, and refusal to do anything I ask her to (even if it's something she really wants to do).... it makes me grit my teeth and want to punch a wall. So I've had to develop coping mechanisms to get through the every day hum drum of the two year old's basic ignorance of anything she hasn't started by herself.\nNow, I'm not saying these coping mechanisms will work for everyone, but they do help me keep my temper in check (most of the time). So if they help anyone else, even a teeny tiny bit, then that's all good!\nThis one has been the biggest one for me. I used to ask S to get her shoes, or come here, or whatever, and she'd ignore me. She would ignore me again, and again, and again regardless of whether I raised my voice, got cross or upset. So to save my own sanity, I decided to accept that she's not quite in that place yet where she can listen all the time, and that me getting cross doesn't benefit any of us.\nSo I now ask her once. If she doesn't move, I take her hand and gently (but firmly) lead her to her shoes, or to have her nappy changed, or to have her dinner. This lessening of expectations has really helped my stress levels, and I even feel that S listens to me more as a result, because the way that I ask has changed because I'm not gearing up to have to shout.\nI don't really like the idea of Time Outs, because they are often perceived as abandoning your child. But sometimes, they are just necessary. Like when S pushes her baby brother so hard he falls over and bangs his head, for the fifth time that morning. Or when she runs off in the park and I have to scramble to grab L and chase after her.\nOur Time Outs take place in the pram. I try to not make it about punishment, although sometimes I am REALLY mad that her brother has hit his head HARD. I explain that she needs to be nice to her brother and that if she can't be calm with him, she needs to sit in the pram until she calms down.\nAt most she gets left for a minute and then I go back and calmly explain what went wrong, and how we can fix it. She then says sorry and kisses me and L before moving on. This does seem to work temporarily, but not for long. Although she is a toddler so I'm not sure it would work for a long period of time no matter what tactic I used.\nThis one has been a big revelation for me. I forget in the hustle and bustle of the day that S doesn't always know, or remember, what's happening that day, and so she doesn't know why I'm asking her to do things.\nI now try to continually give her cues throughout the morning about where we are going and why, so that she is really for the changes that are coming. So while I'm making breakfast I'll tell her that after breakfast we can get ready and go to the park/see friends/go to nursery, and I repeat it as I move through the morning tasks like dressing and brushing hair.\nI've found it makes her much more willing to sit still and have her hair brushed, to go and get her shoes and to generally move a little bit quicker.\nI also give her count down warnings before we leave places. I'm pretty honest about timings, but S knows the order the warnings come in, so she is much more prepared to leave by the time I am ready to go. It's made the upset at leaving a lot easier to handle.\nSpending all day with young children does wear on me quite quickly. I love them to death but it's really hard trying to think for three people, to keep everyone entertained and on track and teach them about the world and how to live in it all at the same time.\nI don't always succeed in keeping calm, in fact I shout and stress more than I would like. So on the days when the stress threatens to take over, I make sure that the kids and I have had doTERRA's Balance blend applied to the backs of our necks. It really helps to bring everything back into perspective, especially when all three of us get a dose of Balance all at the same time! i think it's one of my most used essential oils, and I think I'll be needing it for the next few years, while S gets out of and L gets into the toddler tantrums.\nSo those are the mechanisms that I employ at the moment to keep myself sane and to get through the day unscathed, do you have any more tips?\nI feel like I say this all the time, but I wish I had known about essential oils when I was pregnant and when my kids were really young. I could have really offered them some additional support (and something to help me get through those tough early days too!).\nFor those of you who have young babies, or are pregnant and expecting your bundle of joy, here are the five essential oils that I would arm myself with if I were pregnant again!\nOn Guard is such an important blend in this house! Babies and toddlers seem to get every single germ that comes within a ten mile radius of them! I use a single drop of On Guard in 10mls of coconut oil or olive oil and apply it to their feet every day to give their immune systems a much needed boost!\nLavender is the ultimate essential oil for babies. It's fantastic for general calming, so would be amazing during the witching hour (if you don't know what that is, don't ask, better to remain oblivious!), it also helps to wind a baby down for bed.\nI also use it in the bath as it's great to support the skin as it repairs and renews itself. Now I have a crawling baby and a running toddler, Lavender comes in handy for all those cuts and scrapes that come with moving targets!\nI don't think I mention Lemon too much but it's great oil for babies. It can be used to help the body to bring down a fever (rather than peppermint which can be too strong for some babies) and it's a great essential oil for supporting the body as it deals with the aftereffects from vaccines. Given our babies get so many in the first year, it's a nifty little oil to have on hand.\nFennel is my first essential oil I reach for when my baby's reflux flares up. It's really gentle on the stomach, but it helps to strengthen and support the digestive system. I would also use it on babies who have colic as often babies with colic have some kind of digestive upset and could do with the additional support.\nI feel like I've been using this everyday for months on end. When my baby and toddler are sick, they are always sick with a massive snotty nose. I have no idea where my kids get all the green mucus from! Breathe is fantastic at helping the respiratory system as it tries to clear out all the gunk. It's particularly useful at night, because if your baby can't breathe, they can't sleep, and if they aren't sleeping, neither are you.\nAre there any other essential oils that you think should in the new baby survival kit?\nThese brownies have been on my mind for sometime. I love love love mint chocolate, sometimes a little bit too much!\nSo I've been dying to make these triple chocolate mint brownies from Clean Eating with a Dirty Mind and see if they are really as good as they look.\nThey are. In fact, I think they are better!\nThey are really rich and squidgy, but the mint makes that all work perfectly! I'm always struggling to really make Paleo recipes that make people want to eat the whole lot in one go, but these are definitely one of those desserts.\nSo take a look at the recipe and then go make some! I also substituted the peppermint extract for doTERRA peppermint essential oil because I couldn't find peppermint extract in Dubai. I swapped the 1/4 of a teaspoon of peppermint extract for just 8 drops of the peppermint essential oil. I think any more than that and you would swamp the recipe, because the chocolate bar you are adding in also has mint in it.\nIf you taste the batter after you have added the eight drops, you'll be able to check whether it has enough mint for you.\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F or 175 degrees C.\n3. Once the chocolate is melted, slowly stir in the liquid coconut oil.\n4. Then stir in the almond butter, maple syrup, peppermint extract and eggs.\n5. Now whisk in the dry ingredients, the coconut palm sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder.\n7. Grease an 8\u00d78\u2033 square glass pan with coconut oil or butter and pour in the brownie batter.\n8. Cook for 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool and enjoy!",

The RBP 2 isn\u2019t the only device supported \u2014 the new Windows 10 IoT Core Insider Preview (we didn\u2019t name it, don\u2019t blame us) is also available for the MinnowBoard Max.\nMicrosoft\u2019s blog post talks up a comprehensive partnership between itself and a variety of IoT companies, including Arduino and Hackster.IO, but there\u2019s obviously a bit of play in exactly how the software giant is supporting various devices and products. With Arduino, Microsoft is talking up how Windows provides a software platform for controlling existing devices (and possibly a means of distributing software for various types of Arduino-based hardware) rather than as any kind of operating system for the devices themselves. Microsoft has put together some basic tutorials on how to use Windows to control an LED light kit powered by an Arduino, for example.\nMicrosoft is positioning Windows 10 as an OS that\u2019s hooked to the right tools for developing IoT projects as well as an operating system that can run on IoT devices. The Raspberry Pi 2 fits into this second category \u2014 the platform\u2019s quad-core Cortex-A7 and 1GB of RAM give it the horsepower to run this stripped down version of Windows 10 quite nicely, though we wouldn\u2019t look for desktop-class performance from the diminutive RBP.\nAt a guess: This is Microsoft pumping its IoT platform as a hub for all devices, while only announcing Windows 10 IoT for two products. Still, the company could do more to make this clear. Whether it can successfully position Windows 10 as an Internet of Things platform when such efforts have typically focused on much lower-end hardware and grass roots efforts than anything Microsoft took an interest in is very much an open question.",

    "text": "But the Senate\u2019s examination of the company\u2019s tax strategies is by no means an isolated inquiry. Broadly, the Senate subcommittee \u2014 which is headed by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan \u2014 has been investigating tax avoidance by multinational companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ, AND APPLE (NASDAQ:AAPL), which have been the subjects of previous congressional hearings. Senate lawmakers discovered in 2013 that Apple owned a subsidiary that had earned $30 million over four years and had no home for tax purposes, while in 2012, Microsoft was found to have transferred nearly half of its net revenue from U.S. retail sales to a Puerto Rican subsidiary between 2009 and 2011, saving the company $4.5 billion in U.S. taxes. In essence, these companies have been case study for congressional lawmakers, who want to show that even though multinational corporations may be taking advantage of legal loopholes in the tax code, these loopholes are hurting the United States economy.\nLevin has long spoke out against the ability of corporations to avoid taxes through what he has called \u201ccomplex structures, dubious transactions and legal fiction.\u201d In his February 26 opening statement before the subcommittee hearing entitled: \u201cOffshore Tax Evasion: The Effort to Collect Unpaid Taxes On Billions in Hidden Offshore Accounts,\u201d the senator made a similar point. \u201cThe American public is angry about offshore tax abuse \u2014 efforts by well-off Americans to evade their U.S. tax obligations by hiding money offshore,\u201d he stated. As ranking minority member of the committee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, explained in his opening statement, that February investigation focused on Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS). The bipartisan investigation into tax haven banks \u201crevealed another unfortunate example of a foreign bank succumbing to the charms of compensation over compliance and uncovered how, for years, Credit Suisse greatly profited by helping U.S clients hide billions of dollars of taxable assets from the U.S. Treasury,\u201d noted McCain.\nRepatriating offshore is legal; companies based in the United States can defer U.S. taxes on their foreign income until they bring profits home. At 35 percent, the United States has the highest tax rate of the industrialized world, while profits brought home from abroad are taxed at a 5.25 percent rate. This means that companies have an incentive to book profits overseas. Caterpillar, for example, had accumulated $17 billion in overseas profits as of the end of last year, profits that have not be taxed by the U.S. government. This is an increase from the $11 billion that was held overseas three years ago. Together the largest companies in the United States have amassed $1.95 trillion abroad, a jump from 2012\u2019s $206 billion, according to a Bloomberg News analysis.\nCaterpillar is among the most active companies lobbying for more favorable U.S. tax rules for handling foreign companies. In 2011 testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ed Rapp \u2014 who was then company\u2019s chief financial officer \u2014 said that Congress should do a \u201cforeign tax code tear down\u201d and replace the current system with a \u201cterritorial\u201d system that wouldn\u2019t include the residual U.S. tax upon repatriation of profits. \u201cI am not asking for special treatment, but am simply asking for a level playing field versus our foreign competitors,\u201d he said. Now, Caterpillar must defend a late 1990s corporate restructuring that helped ruduce the company\u2019s U.S. taxes; before that corporate change, the company\u2019s U.S. operations bought parts from suppliers and then sold them to overseas customers, which meant those sales were immediately subject to U.S. tax. Then after the restructure, a Swiss subsidiary was in put charge of purchasing and reselling parts, removing U.S. operations from the process and therefore reducing tax liabilities.\nComparatively, Dorothy Coleman, a vice president at the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group whose current chairman is Caterpillar Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman, said Congress should fix the tax code rather the spending time investigating individual firms. \u201cWe have an antiquated tax code,\u201d Coleman told the Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s out of sync with the rest of the world, and it\u2019s holding us back.\u201d Jennifer Blouin, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, went so far as to tell the publication that it was unfair for the Senate to put individual companies under the microscope for finding legal means to reduce tax burdens. This is sort of rational behavior if you\u2019re competing in a global market,\u201d she said.",

    "text": "The European Road Championships 2015 in Tartu, Estonia are about to begin. Here's a quick look on all you need to know about the race.\nTrofeo Karlsberg is one of the hardest races in the Juniors racing calendar. It's a UCI race and has the status of a nations cup stage race, meaning the teams competing consist of national teams. Representing 19 countries in total including some strong cycling nations such as Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, USA and Italy, just a few to mention. The race consisted of 3 days of racing and 4 stages in total between 5th and 7th of June 2015. Together with part of the Finnish team we started our journey towards Gersheim, Germany on June 2nd.\nLast week I got a call and that changed my plans for the upcoming week. I was supposed to go to Pirkan Py\u00f6r\u00e4ily and ride the 217 km long route, but instead I will head towards Germany tomorrow. More precisely, Trofeo Karlsberg together with the Finnish Junior National Road Cycling Team. We will leave Turku tomorrow evening and will arrive at our destination in Gersheim on Thursday.\nIt's now more than a week ago since the TS Kortteliajot was ridden and I finally got time to put together a small race report. The TS Kortteliajot Sunday started off with slight rain in the morning, meaning the race would be ridden in wet conditions. That would make the hard race even harder. Fincycling had a 5 man strong team for the race.\nThe Simo Klimscheffskij memorial race opened the Skoda Maantiecup last weekend in Turku, Finland. Fincycling had a 6 man strong team for the race consisting of; Joel Bergman, Simo Ter\u00e4v\u00e4, Jaakko H\u00e4nninen, Aku Keloneva, Ville Hirvenoja and Jonas Nordstr\u00f6m.\nThis weekend is the official grand opening of the Finnish road cycling season. Simo Klimscheffskij memorial ride will be ridden on Saturday and TS Kortteliajot will be ridden on Sunday. Fincycling will be racing on both days.\nIt has been a great couple of weeks with a lot going on around Fincycling. As I am writing this, the team is heading for Otep\u00e4\u00e4, Estonia for the second training camp this spring. The first training camp was held in Tikkurila between March 21st and 22nd. Another important event, a press conference, was held on Monday March 30th. A new team and new sponsors were introduced and the event was well noticed by the Finnish press. In this article you can read about the first training camp, the Fincycling 2015 team, the schedule for 2015 and about the Fincycling press conference.\nThe Fincycling project continues to grow as we saw an agreement between the Cycling Union of Finland (Suomen Py\u00f6r\u00e4ilyunioni ry) and Fincycling take shape January 6th 2015. The great efforts done by the whole Fincycling team has paid off, and for the coming years 2015 - 2017, Fincycling will be taking care of the U19 boys training and racing schedule. This if something is a proof of a job well done and shows the level of trust for this project.\nFirst season for Fincycling is now behind. A first year is often a year of learning, both for the cyclists and the staff. And this was exactly what the first year was for Fincycling as well, learning by doing. And there was a lot of doing.\nThe Cup of Zemgale stage race in Latvia began today in a great way. The 3,1 km long prologue was won by Niklas \"Nikke\" Henttala representing Fincycling with an average speed of 47,29 km/h in 3 minutes and 56 seconds. Niklas is one of the talented Junior riders in the team, and he will be wearing the leader's yellow jersey tomorrow. You can find the full result list here.\nThe race will continue with a 70 km stage tomorrow following by another ITT stage. The race will end on Saturday August 30th. Five stages with somewhat short stages will make the race really explosive. Juniors from many strong cycling countries are represented, such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Belarus and Finland of course.\nWhat's great about this week's race is that the Fincycling squad is actually \"bigger\" than usual. Besides juniors who have been competing with Fincycling throughout the season, also juniors who will join the squad next year have the opportunity to race with the team. The only way to become a professional is to compete on a high level, and with Fincycling this opportunity is given to our young talented riders.\nAt the beginning of the season talking with the Fincycling people, we heard that the first year will be dedicated to the junior boys aged 16-18 and that the project would aim to support even girls and U23 men in the future, maybe in some years. Well the Fincycling squad has already done something supportive for both of those. Earlier this month in Norway, the Fincycling team introduced girls in their squad in the Arctic Heroes of Tomorrow Race (more of this later). And again, in Cup of Zemgale the Fincycling team is introducing Laura Vainionp\u00e4\u00e4 (W U23) to the racing field. It's a great way to gain experience competing with the guys.\nIt is with joy I watch the Fincycling team, that began as a project only less than a year ago, grow and do so much good to the sport in Finland. More than any Finnish national organization has been able to do in a long time, maybe ever? Having heard how the boys have learned during this year, and been able to improve as cyclists both in and out of the saddle makes me really feel positive about the future of Finnish cycling. Of course there are lots and lots of work to do and we know the road to the elite is tough, but all the hard work done by the Fincycling team gives a solid ground for our juniors to build on.\nFincycling season is well on its way, and so far the team has been racing in Estonia, Finland and Poland. Next up is a stage race in Finland this weekend (AHH etappiajot) and Switzerland (46\u00e8me Tour du Pays de Vaud) next week. Aleksi H\u00e4nninen, Niklas Henttala, Lauri Koski, Erik Relanto, Jaakko H\u00e4nninen and Antto Tunkkari build up the Fincycling team in AHH etappiajot and the team representing Fincycling in 46\u00e8me Tour du Pays de Vaud is Aleksi H\u00e4nninen, Niklas Henttala, Lauri Koski, Erik Relanto, Antto Tunkkari and Marco Tapio Niemi.\nAs a small wrap up from the early season start here is a small recap of day 2 in Turku a couple of weeks ago, part 1 you can still find here.\nAfter a great day one and a successful gala-evening Fincycling was ready for day two, TS Kortteliajot in Turku, a real spring classic in Finland. Every team and rider in Finland wants to win this race, and usually it ends up in a bunch sprint. Team Fincycling was having five riders for the race, Sasu Halme, Aleksi H\u00e4nninen, Antto Tunkkari, Waltteri Lepist\u00f6 and Arttu Suvisaari.\nAnd off it went, Fincycling at the front, of course!\nThe boys reacted to all breakaway attempts, strong performance once again!\nWho's keeping up the pace and making the race difficult for everyone? Fincycling of course!\nSasu had a super strong day! He was attacking and attacking and closing gaps, working like Voigt one could say!\nAntto was misplaced in the bunch and lost control to the front and was flagged off towards the end.He really fought until the end! Charly giving feedback and support for a good job done.\nTWD L\u00e4nken had a stronger team this time and Ilari Kahila took the win after a perfect leadout.\nA superb job all day by Sasu, he finished 7th with the same time as the winner.\nFincycling after the finish. Good job all weekend!\nIt was great to see the guys executing the tactics set up for both days and they really made the race hard for everyone. Experience is what is needed to win, the boys are on their way on the learning curve, and having seen the attitude the whole team has it is a promising start indeed.\nSo let's wish our guys the best for AHH etappiajot and the 46\u00e8me Tour du Pays de Vaud next week.\nKilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry., founded in October 2013, has started the season 2014 with a great pace. The association aims to lift the Finnish cycle racing scene to a level where it deserves to be \u2013 it\u2019s after all one of the most popular competitive sports in our neighboring countries. The founding members of the association (27 members) have all achieved an internationally successful career, and some are still active in the world of elite cycling. Such members are Jussi Veikkanen, Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m, Charly Wegelius, Joona Laukka, Mika H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, Jukka Heinikainen and Kimmo Kananen \u2013 to name a few.\nAmbitious goals were set up for the first season: 16-18 year old junior cyclists from national teams around the country will be participating in both international and top national races, resulting in some 65-70 race days during the 2014 season. The operations are made possible by dedicated voluntary work by the founding members and by the financial support from the sponsors, SKODA, Helkama, PowerBar, Sportful, Shimano, EuroSport, Polar, dmp, Javatrans and Leijona-tuote. During the 2014 season, at least 14 boys will participate in international races, following the international rules of attending with a six man strong team in each race.\nThe first kickoff was held with 14 boys at Solvalla Idrottsinstitut between January 31st and February 2nd. The aim of the camp was to inform the boys, their coaches and parents about the project and what it would be all about. Charly Wegelius (Garmin-Sharp), Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m (IAM Cycling), Kimmo Kananen (Shimano), Jani Paju (Fustra), Juho Suikkari and Marko Vauhkonen all acted as instructors during the weekend. Focus was also set on the comprehensive training programs and the professionals shared their knowledge with the coaches. As cycling is a sport where proper set-up and equipment matter, the boys were instructed about the importance of an accurate bike fit and the impact it can have in both comfort and efficiency on the bike. These instructions were provided by Shimano Nordic and Fustra. The technical and tactical aspects were also highlighted and presented both with interactive conversations and through watching some interesting videos. The importance of nutrition during both training and racing was equally highlighted. Fincycling team is energized with PowerBar products.\nOur boys made a trip to Estonia during Easter. The team consisted of Simo Ter\u00e4v\u00e4 (16), Jonne Itkonen (16), Jaakko H\u00e4nninen (17), Ville Hirvenoja (17), Walteri Lepist\u00f6 (18) and Lauri Koski (18). In Estonia we lived and trained together with the National Junior cycling team of Estonia who live and train in Audentese Sports-school in Otep\u00e4\u00e4. A race was also scheduled for Sunday, a national race with 271 cyclists at the start line, among them ex-professionals and team Alfa Baltic, a professional team from Latvia. The Fincycling team started off well and the boys executed and followed the pre-planned race tactics all the way. A good effort was rewarded with a great 14th place for Waltteri Lepist\u00f6 (5th in the youth classification). Toomas Kirsipuu, a legendary Estonian ex professional cyclist was also impressed by the Fincycling team effort. Toomas, who today actively supports the local junior cyclists, also participated in the race and therefore closely followed the Fincycling team in action.\nApril 26th and 27th marks the official cycling season opening in Turku, Finland. Fincycling took part with a team consisting of Aleksi H\u00e4nninen (18), Sasu Halme (18),Waltteri Lepist\u00f6(18), Antto Tunkkari (18) and Arttu Suvisaari (18). Charly Wegelius, former world-class professional cyclist and today one of the sports directors at Team Garmin-Sharp flew to Finland and joined the team on Saturday morning. Charly Wegelius was the sports director for team Fincycling during the weekend. Having such a person in the team as Charly gives the boys in Fincycling the best possible guidance and support on their way to the world elite. The race tactics was again executed close to perfection and our rider Aleksi H\u00e4nninen was in the 12-man breakaway, which went all the way to the finish. The race was won by a Latvian professional rider, Maris Bogdanovics, and Aleksi finished 10th overall being the best junior.\nThe Finnish spring classic, Turun Sanomien kortteliajot the following day was another good performance by the team. The race plan was executed once again well, and especially Sasu Halme had a strong day in the saddle being at the front throughout the race and fighting at the final bunch sprint. TWD-L\u00e4nken, the number one road cycling team in Finland this time had more riders and a stronger team and made a good leadout for the winner Ilari Kahila. Sasu Halme crossed the finish line as 7th rider and secured the junior overall win with Aleksi H\u00e4nninen taking overall second place for team Fincycling (Pavel Sveshnikov 3rd).\nDuring the weekend Kilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry. also organized a cycling season 2014 - opening gala as a part of financing its own operations. The work done by the association has drawn a great attention in significant cycling countries, therefore many professional teams and cyclists donated valuable items for an auction held at the gala. Items were donated by reigning road cycling world champion Rui Costa (Team LAMPRE-MERIDA), Team SKY, Sylvain Chavanel (Team IAM Cycling), Daniel Martin (Team Garmin-Sharp) and the reigning Finnish road cycling champion Jussi Veikkanen (Team FDJ.fr) to mention a few. The project also awoke interest and enthusiasm, which culminated in the auction.\n\u2013A great project to support our youth, educating both internationalization and cycling at the same time, Marko Toivonen, Sales Manager of DMP Diesel added.\nHe became the owner of a valuable Team Sky signed jersey.\nThe first international race, La Coupe du Pr\u00e9sident de la Ville de Grudziadz (UCI 2.1), was ridden in Poland between May 1st and May 5th. The race included 5 stages with a total length of 408,1 km.\nA UCI 2.1 race is the highest category for juniors where only national-, Team- and clubs can attend. 176 riders, 36 teams with 10 nationalities entered the race. A major part of the roads were in bad shape, which would make the race really hard. Aleksi H\u00e4nninen (18), Marco-Tapio Niemi (18), Lauri Koski (18), Waltteri Lepist\u00f6 (18), Arttu Suvisaari (18), Erik Relanto (17) formed the Fincycling squad with Mauno Uusivirta as soigneur (former professional cyclist with both Olympic and world championship experience) and Marko Vauhkonen as sports director.\nFew Fincycling boys have international experience. The objectives were to work well as a team and use the knowledge learnt during winter and spring from both Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m and Charly Wegelius. The race began with a 12, 5 km team time-trial, Marco-Tapio was the only boy to have previous experience of a team time-trial. With a great support from Mauno Uusivirta who has lots of experience of team time-trials the team ended up with 21st place having an average speed of 49, 8 km/h, a really good effort. The following stage was ridden that same day and the rest of the stages in the coming days. Fortunately the condition of the roads was a bit better towards the end. Unfortunate was that two boys did catch a cold in the really chilly weather.\nSports director Marko Vauhkonen was really pleased by all the actions during the race. Attitude, willingness to learn and team spirit could not have been better.\n\u2013 I really got emotional when I watched our boys execute everything they\u2019ve learnt during the project so far, a really great way to show their respect for all people involved in the Fincycling project. The race in Poland was a great boost in the team self confidence, to the grade where Fincycling actually dominated the race events during the last stage. The whole team worked really hard to push Aleksi H\u00e4nninen to a podium place and top 15 overall position that day. Despite hard work, this time the goal was not reached, but the confidence within the team really grew a lot. Experience and confidence are key success factors in developing as a team and a cyclist.\n1. Placing among the top third in the team classification. 36 teams started (5-6 man teams) where only 24 managed to finish the race, Fincycling being the 12th best team.\nNow it\u2019s time to rest, go to school and prepare for future races. The next race will be between May 24th and May 25th where team Fincycling will participate in AAH Etappiajo, a Finnish national stage race (Elite) in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. When the race in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 is finished, the team will immediately head for the next race in Switzerland, where they will participate in 46\u00e8me Tour du Pays de Vaud UCI 2.1 between May 29th and June 1st.\nPart 2 of the cycling weekend in Turku will be released soon, stay tuned! You can find Part one here.\nFincycling opened the national racing season last weekend in Turku.This is the first part of the race report from the weekend and includes the story from Simo Klimscheffskij\u2019n muistoajo - race on Saturday (and loads of pictures and a video). The second part will cover the following day of racing - TS Kortteliajot on Sunday.\nSaturday began with the team arriving to Turku at around mid-day. The team for the weekend was built up by 5 guys, Sasu Halme, Aleksi H\u00e4nninen, Antto Tunkkari, Waltteri Lepist\u00f6 and Arttu Suvisaari. Usually the team consists of 6 riders but this time Jaakko H\u00e4nninen was unfortunate to be ill just before the race and couldn't participate.\nMarko Vauhkonen would serve as the mechanic and Charly Wegelius, also known as the sports director of Team Garmin-Sharp would be the sports director for Fincycling during the weekend. So again, the boys would have a highly skilled and experienced team to back them up.\nAfter a proper briefing by Charly Wegelius, it was time to change to race outfit. I have to say this team kit is really good looking. Not to mention it is the same quality Team Tinkoff-Saxo is racing.\nThe race would be in Hirvensalo, just outside of Turku, this served as a good warmup for the guys, some 6 km to spin the legs before the race would start.\nThe race would be 73 kilometers long and be ridden on a circuit with a length of 4 kilometers. The finish would be on top of a 800 m long hill, hard after many laps riding it over and over again.\nThe race was pretty hectic. On each lap there was at least one breakaway attempt, and the Fincycling guys did a great job in having at least one cyclist at the front at all time, catching up those breakaways. And on one lap the breakaway was succesful, and there was Aleksi H\u00e4nninen working to form a proper gap to the peloton.\nThe final climb was hard as expected and blew the legs out of many riders. Aleksi managed to hang in the last hundred meters and finished 10th. The other guys did tried to attack from the peloton in the final lap but didn't manage to create a gap to the peloton, and finished with the main group. All in all, a strong ride by the whole team, the boys were riding like men.\nAleksi took 1st place in the M-18 class, next year the whole race!\nThe next part will cover the Finnish spring classic TS Kortteliajot. Last but not least a little sneak peek in the Fincycling team car where Charly Wegelius gives instructions to Aleksi riding in the breakaway.\nNote! If you do want to use any of the pictures, please contact me!\nFincycling, the cycling project started by Kilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry. is really moving forward in a great pace. The first race in Estonia 18th - 21st of April is just behind the corner and this is the first time we will see the young boys competing in their Fincycling equipment. Not long after that we will see the boys competing in Turku, Finland where also I will be reporting from. This will be the 26th and 27th of April, with Simo Klimscheffskij muistoajot on Saturday and TS Kortteliajot on Sunday.\nBesides these races, on Saturday 26th of April a cycling Gala will be held in Turku. Present will be some big names from the world of cycling as well as influential people in Finland. During the evening some of the names in the Fincycling team will be presented. To support the team, an auction will be held. There are some great items in this auction, for instance the current road cycling world champion jersey by Rui Alberto Faria da Costa, just one great item to mention. All the proceeds from the auction and the Gala will be used to support the Fincycling cyclists. If you have any questions regarding the Gala, you can for instance shoot Suomen Py\u00f6r\u00e4ily nousuun facebook page with a message. The official invitation (in Finnish) you can find here.\nAnother great thing for supporting the Fincycling team is the Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m py\u00f6r\u00e4ilyleiri (Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m cycling camp). This is a training camp held in Solvalla idrottsinstitut 1.4 - 4.5.2014 and is a complete package with information about nutrition, how to train right, equipment, how to ride in group and much more. The coaching will be done by professionals such as Carlstr\u00f6m himself. This is a unique chance for any active cyclists to improve both knowledge and results with the help of real cycling professionals. More information is found in Finnish and Swedish.\nIt is great to see the Fincycling team gain more and more attention all the time, and it will be really exciting to have the race season opened soon. Besides the Fincycling team schedule, these young boys also compete for their local cycling teams in Finland. So a lot of racing coming up for the young cyclists. And as we all know, that's the only way to make progress and that's the way to do a name for yourself if you want to become a professional cyclist. These boys are on the right track. Let's keep the wheels turning!\nRead more about the Fincycling official launch here.\nThe project launched by Kilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry, to lift the Finnish competitive cycling to a level where it deserves to be at, was finally publicly presented yesterday. Fincycling.com is the site where you will in the future be able to find all about the Fincycling Team and the progress. Of course I will be closely following this team and the project as well. To have such a professional and experienced squad including big names in cycling, both nationally and internationally known names (Carlstr\u00f6m, Veikkanen, Wegelius, Laukka, Kananen and the list goes on and on) makes this project really stand out.\nFincycling is a great example of what passion and will can create. The people involved have invested a lot of their spare time and money to this project, for many it is about giving back to cycling what cycling has given them. It is with great warmth and joy I watch this project progress day by day closer to the season start.\nIt was also great to see that media had found interest in the project, our national public broadcasting channel YLE also presented Fincycling in the evening sports-news in both Finnish and Swedish. Link to Finnish here and in Swedish here.\nWe also connected with Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m, live on stage 6 of Tirreno-Adriatico with 120km to go.\nIn a couple of months the Fincycling team has taken great leaps forward, and knowing the pace and the passion for the ones working on this project, we are surely going to see some great news in the upcoming months as well.\nSo stay tuned, the season begins in April, I will keep you updated!\nAs some of you might remember I wrote about the Finnish cycling project that aims at lifting our road cycling future to a whole new level. We have a strong history in endurance sports such as cross country skiing and running, but in cycling we've never been able to reach a level such as our Scandinavian neighbors Sweden, Norway and Denmark has. One could blame it on the weather conditions, but that doesn't make sense since our neighbors have the same conditions.\nI\u2019m really happy and at the same time super excited about this new project that will hopefully have a huge impact in our cycling culture and finally help our young talents to reach the top elite in cycling. Suomen Kilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry (freely translated Finnish Cycle Racing association) was founded by 27 members not just anybody, but by the cycling elite in Finland including such names as current professional cyclist Jussi Veikkanen former professionals Charly Wegelius (directeur sportif, Team Garmin Sharp) and Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m (directeur sportif, IAM Cycling Team) who are both still involved in the professional cycling today.\nJust last week I had the opportunity to meet one of the founding members of Suomen Kilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry., Marko Vauhkonen. Marko has a strong background in cycling, as one of his best personal achievements as a cyclist he mention the year 1984 and the Nordic championships (track) where he took a bronze medal. He has a strong background in international cycling as well, having experienced both European and world championships in both road- and track cycling.\nMarko Vauhkonen - Suomen Kilpapy\u00f6r\u00e4ily ry.\nI was really excited to meet him. Since I hadn't heard a lot about the project, but I knew there were many really big names behind it, I knew it would be big. We took a coffee and sat down, I thought it would be an hour, but I guess it took more than two and a half hours at the end. I guess when you have two cycling freaks talking about cycling, you shouldn't assume such things.\nJuho Suikkari, Kimmo Kananen, Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m, Jari Vanninen, Peter Selin, Patrick Wackstr\u00f6m, Sixten Wackstr\u00f6m, Marko Vauhkonen, Mika H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, Kimmo Karhu, Oscar Stenstr\u00f6m, Tauno Hietala, Peter Klimscheffskij, Vesa Rauttu, Pertti Linna, Jouni Hakala, Joona Laukka, Jussi Veikkanen, Harri Hedgren, Veikko Sinisalo, Juha Poutiainen, Kari Myllym\u00e4ki, Vesa Mattila, Jukka Heinikainen, Christian Selin, Charley Wegelius and Jyrki Tujunen.\nMany of you recognize some or most of of these names for sure. So after a \"short\" introduction of presenting myself to Marko and vice versa, I was eager to know how and why this project got started? It was easy for Marko to answer this question.\nIt struck me how fast everything was built up. This of course is just a sign of how passionate these guys are about cycling and about their will to really do something important and big for cycling. At this point I was eager to know more and tried to take in all information possible.\nQ: What are the main goals for the project?\n\u201cWe want to look at this, not just as a single thing that will take our youth quickly to the top, but as a complete learning experience for our young riders. We have a clear mission to build sustainable, competitive and healthy youth. Money should not be an obstacle for anyone and our mission is to help, support and advice young riders how to be independent and help them gain international experience, which is such a crucial component in being successful.\nCycling races were won by individual efforts back in the 1930\u2019s, but today you win and lose as a team.\nAll of us involved, we have a strong knowledge in the world of cycling all the way from the early -80\u2019s, and we want to share that experience with our youngsters. We really want to emphasize the fact that cycling is a team sport more than anything else. We want our riders to really feel and internalize that what you give to the team, you\u2019ll have back doubled. A team is as strong as its weakest link. Cycling races were won by individual efforts back in the 1930\u2019s, but today you win and lose as a team.\nAll of that makes sense, right? Think about being a young rider and having a team like that behind you, supporting, sharing thoughts and advice with you. Being together with your role models and having them support you must be a \u201cdream come true\u201d for any athlete.\nQ: What can you tell us about the support and visibility of the campaign so far?\nSo at this point, having the backgrounds I really wanted to know more about the cyclists, the team the first training camp, well everything. I tried to hold myself together.\nQ: About the team, can you tell us more about the age group, what type of riders you have selected and how is the selection done?\nQ: In social media we saw a couple of weeks ago pictures and some stories from your first training camp. How was it, what was the agenda and how would you sum up the training camp?\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d say it was as good as a training camp can be. No, actually it was even better. It was one of the best training camps I've seen and experienced content-wise in my life. Probably it was so rich in content that the youngsters weren't able to assimilate everything, but if they were able to memorize 30 % of what was said, they already took a great leap forward as cyclists. Besides great lectures and support by Kimmo Kananen, Kjell Carlstr\u00f6m and Charly Wegelius, we had an individual bike fit for the guys, surprisingly all had to make some adjustments in their positioning on the bike.\nWe also had the opportunity to have Jani Paju with us, who introduced Fustra to the guys. Fustra has been a success in many countries and is also used by the top elite as a way to improve especially your core strength. In cycling, Fustra is used for instance by IAM Cycling Team.\nWe also focused on activities that were not related to cycling where the focus was on building team spirit. And I think we nailed that as well, better than expected.\nAs a final question I wanted to know when we\u2019ll see a Finn on the podium, either in a spring Classics race or on a grand tour. Marko didn't need to think for long.\nAnd so, two and a half hours later we realized it was already pretty late. Time goes by so fast when you talk about cycling. I\u2019m really excited to follow this project, and having heard many details I cannot yet reveal here, I\u2019m looking forward to a year in cycling I've never experienced before. It was also really great to meet Marko, such a great person! I will be reporting about the project as it progresses so stay tuned! We will see the new team compete for the first in Finland in Turku, April 26th and 27th. So stay tuned for updates, there will be some great news, I promise you that!",

    "text": "Freeze Substitution is a process for low temperature dehydration and fixation of rapidly frozen cells that usually takes days to complete. With the amazing work of K.L. McDonald and R.I. Webb1 they have now introduced a new method for freeze substitution with a basic kit that we are proud to offer.\nWith this unique kit researchers are now able to achieve excellent freeze substitution results in as little as 90 minutes for cells of small volume such as bacteria and tissue culture cells. For those cells of greater volume or that have significant diffusion barriers such as cuticles or thick cell walls, one can extend the time to 3 hours simply by putting a lid on the box.\nCool the metal block by submerging completely in liquid nitrogen in the ice bucket. Leave for 5 minutes or until the \"boiling\" stops.\nIn a separate box, transfer samples into cryovials with frozen fixative, keeping everything at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Seal tightly and be very sure that there is no liquid nitrogen trapped in the vial. Trapped liquid can cause the vials to explode upon warming. It is best to use a room temperature lid when sealing the tube.\nPut the vials with samples into holes in the cooled metal block.\nGo to a PC (Macs won't work) that has the Lascar datalogger software installed and name and start the program.\nPour off the liquid nitrogen from the block and box, making sure not to let the cryovials come out of the holes in the block.\nArrange the block so the cryovials are horizontal and put the tops of the vials against one side of the foam box. Use a piece of foam or wadded up paper behind the block so it keeps the vials from falling out of the block during shaking.\nTurn on the shaker at 100-125 rpm and allow it to gradually warm until the temperature is at least 0\u00b0C before removing the vials for rinsing and resin infiltration. This operation should take place in a fume hood in case there is any leakage of osmium-acetone from poorly sealed vials. Freeze substitution will take about 2 hours with the lid off, and about 3 hours with the lid on (though this may vary from lab to lab).\nRemove the vials from the metal block and place them onto a rocker at room temperature and wait until they come to about 20\u00b0C, then stop the datalogger and save the files.\nRinse out the fixative with 3-4 rinses in acetone and proceed to infiltration and embedding. Take care opening the vials as pressure built up inside can cause a spray of the freeze substitution media.\nTobacco leaf prepared by the quick FS method (Webb & McDonald, 2011). Abbreviations: N = nucleus; Ch = chloroplast; CW = cell wall; Cy = cytoplasm; ER = endoplasmic reticulum; V = vacuole; and, G = Golgi apparatus. Bar = 0.5 \u00b5m. Tobacco leaf prepared as above showing details of the cell wall (CW) and chloroplast (Ch) and cell membranes. Bar = 100 nm.\nIn well-frozen samples the water molecules are not likely to move around very much, even as the temperatures rise to a point where you would expect hexagonal ice (Dubochet, 2007).\nAgitation should speed up the substitution of acetone for water molecules in much the same way that agitation speeds up development of film.\nWater in the substitution mixture does not appear to slow down substitution as was once believed. In fact, it is known to help membrane contrast (Buser and Walther, 2008).\nDoes it work for all samples?\nIf a sample can be successfully freeze substituted by the old methods, then the quick FS method should work just as well.\nMcDonald and Webb have used this procedure with complete success for over a year and a half for all the samples they have freeze substituted.\nIf samples show evidence of ice damage then it is because they were damaged during freezing and not during freeze substitution.\nTypical temperature curves using the EMS Freeze Substitution Kit. With the lid OFF the time to 0\u00b0C is about 2 hours. With the lid ON the time is about 3 hours. Results may vary depending on the particular setting of the shaker. For example, hood air flow can have a definite influence on the shape of the curves.\nCross-section through nerve cells in the head of C.elegans. A BHK cell processed in 90 minutes by the quick FS method. Abbreviations: CCP = clathrin-coated pit, Cav = caveolae, EE = early endosome, IF = intermediate filaments, LE = late endosome, M = mitochondrion, MT = microtubule. Bar = 1 \u00b5m. Modified from McDonald and Webb (2011). Mitotic spindle microtubules and spindle pole bodies in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nThe equipment should be used in a fume hood in case there is a leak of osmium-acetone during a run. We suggest doing a trial run with acetone only in the cryovials to make sure that they are sealed correctly.\nWhen sealing cryotubes that contain frozen fixative and sample, use a warm cap so that the O-ring is flexible and gives a good seal.\nTake care when removing the caps after a FS run because there is some pressure built up inside the cryotubes and you can spray osmium/acetone on your hands if you are not careful. Cover the cap with a piece of lab tissue when removing and wear gloves.\nDubochet, J. (2007). The physics of rapid cooling and its implications for cryoimmobilization of cells. Meth.

    "text": "2015 NBA Power Rankings: Who's on Top Heading into Playoffs?\nNo, Jim Mora. We're not kidding you. We, too, are excited for the NBA playoffs. After five-and-a-half months of back-to-backs, TNT Thursday nights and countless hours debating who's better and who's best, it's finally time to let the players and coaches decide a true champion.\nTo be sure, you'll hear no complaints from me about the season that was. The 2014-15 campaign was arguably the most exciting and intriguing one the Association has seen in some time. From the rise of the Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks to the depth of competition out West to the scramble to fill out the Eastern Conference bracket, there was nary a dull moment from start to finish in the league's schedule.\nThat being the case, it might seem like a tall order for the playoffs to live up to the regular season that just transpired. But without a clear-cut favorite to take home the Larry O'Brien Trophy, this postseason is shaping up to be every bit as captivating as the slate that preceded it, if not more so.\nBefore we get wrapped up in all the best-of-seven series to come, let's look back to see how the NBA as a whole finished up by ranking each of the 30 teams based on how they played down the stretch and which players they had available.\nAnother year, another sad slate of basketball for the Minnesota Timberwolves. An incessant spate of injuries\u2014from Kevin Martin's wrist to Kevin Garnett's knee to Shabazz Muhammad's finger to the ankles of Ricky Rubio and Nikola Pekovic and beyond\u2014doomed the Wolves to their 11th straight trip to the lottery from start to finish in 2014-15.\nLaVine might (eventually) be one of those teammates. The UCLA product nearly averaged 19 points, five rebounds and five assists while shooting better than 40 percent from three over his final 18 games (17 starts).\nThe Wolves can look forward to a summer marked by growth from their youngsters, rather than one consumed by the inevitable ouster of an anxious franchise cornerstone. That, in itself, could be enough to ignite a productive offseason in Minnesota, along with whatever the team yields from its latest lottery pick.\nAnd if the Wolves can exterminate their infestation of injury bugs before October, they just might make something meaningful of 2015-16.\nNerlens Noel won't likely wind up as the NBA's Rookie of the Year, but unlike last year's winner (Michael Carter-Williams), the Kentucky product can probably count on a long-term future with the Philadelphia 76ers.\nNoel did plenty to make up for lost time after missing what would have been his maiden campaign in 2013-14 while recovering from a torn ACL. He led all rookies in double-doubles and was the only player in the league to finish in the top 10 in both steals and blocks, all while missing a mere six of his team's 82 games.\nEach game, eight Sixers staffers would track different metrics, including shot contests, hustle plays and how quickly players attacked different areas after an offensive miss and filled sections of the court defending in transition. After the game, the overall team and each player would receive a grade, 1-20, with the latter being the highest.\nBrown said more than 60 percent of the time in games this season, the team finished at a respectable 16. As for Noel, more than 60 percent of the time he was better than 12 in games. But the most significant number is this: When he was an 18 or higher, the Sixers won 15 of the 18 games.\nNoel may not be the star of the future for the Sixers, but if everyone else plays as hard as he does, the team should still be in good shape long-term.\nThe Orlando Magic were never likely to so much as sniff the playoffs this year, even in the weak East. From the get-go, their roster was more smorgasbord of useful pieces than cohesive whole and wasn't likely to move much from the former toward the latter under the uninspired auspices of Jacque Vaughn. The team's decision to can Vaughn during the season confirmed as much.\nWhoever fills Orlando's void on the bench more permanently will be charged with that same daunting but doable task\u2014of molding the likes of Victor Oladipo, Elfrid Payton, Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon and the fruit of the Magic's lottery pick into an honest-to-goodness team.\nJames Borrego, who replaced Vaughn on an interim basis, will get a look at the gig, following a so-so second-half audition.\n\"I absolutely believe that I can do this,\" Borrego told NBA.com's John Denton. \"My confidence is very high, and this position has forced me to get there. Give our players credit and our staff credit because they have helped me get through this.\"\nGranted, Borrego isn't out of the woods just yet. According to the Orlando Sentinel's Brian K. Schmitz, Michael Malone, who was one of the finalists to succeed Stan Van Gundy three years ago, is among those eager to interview for the gig.\nIf there's any consolation for Orlando's post-Dwight Howard doldrums, it's that the team's job opening could be the most desirable one in the NBA this summer.\nIf the Los Angeles Lakers didn't, in fact, hit rock bottom this season, then they're going to need some sturdier digging equipment.\nAfter losing a then-franchise-record 55 games last year, the purple and gold managed to fall even further in 2014-15. They registered their first 60-loss campaign and their lowest single-season winning percentage while logging more games lost to injury than 2013-14's snakebitten bunch.\nSteve Nash was done before the schedule began. Rookie Julius Randle broke his leg in Game 1. Kobe Bryant's shoulder gave way in January. By the time the Lakers made it to the finish line, four more guys (i.e., Nick Young, Ronnie Price, Wayne Ellington and Dwight Buycks) would suffer season-ending injuries.\nLin really wanted this to work, entering this season with one of the most unstable career paths in sports history. And in search of feel-good stories in an unquestionably dry spell for the franchise, the Lakers hoped bringing Lin back to his birthplace would spark the sort of special stuff we all know he's had in the past.\nInstead, Lin was downright disappointing night after night early in the season. He was unnerved by Lakers coach Byron Scott's lack of belief in his game and discouraged by the rising negativity all around him.\nChances are that Lin will find employment elsewhere this summer. In his place, the Lakers will likely turn to rookie Jordan Clarkson, the lone bright spot amid this year's cloudy misery, or a high-priced free agent of some sort to run point.\nAnd, with any better luck, the Lakers will have the pieces in place to restore some of their signature shine next season.\nLike the Lakers, the New York Knicks came into the 2014-15 season intending to win, even though the circumstances were ripe for failure.\nInjuries and roster turnover all but assured the Knicks of a return trip to the lottery, as did the 5-36 start that the instability precipitated. Carmelo Anthony's decision to undergo knee surgery after the All-Star Game was merely another nail in New York's orange-and-blue coffin.\nAs miffed as many folks in the Big Apple may be with the job Phil Jackson and Derek Fisher have done in leading the Knicks so far, not everyone in town is so down on the team's prospects.\nNobody expected the season to be like this. We all expected at least to somewhat compete in the Eastern Conference. At the end of the day we wanted to make a playoff push, but that's not how the season played out.\nThis next season for me and for the organization and for Phil this is where we earn our money. This is where it starts. We got to put our money where our mouths (are) at. We've been put in a situation where the pieces are broken and a lot of things have been changed around here. Now we got a clean plate. We got a chance to get a top draft pick. We got a lot of money in the cap. So we got to put that to work. We got to put something together.\nThe Charlotte Hornets could have easily blamed their 5-16 finish to the 2014-15 season\u2014and the playoff shortfall it sealed\u2014on the incessant spate of injuries, but they didn't.\n\"This is a disappointing year. We took a step back,\" head coach Steve Clifford admitted, per The Charlotte Observer's Rick Bonnell. \"We weren't as disciplined, we made too many mistakes, more nights when we weren't ready to play. We're not a 33-win team. And I'm primarily responsible for that.\"\nThe players, to their credit, aren't running from their failures. Lance Stephenson, for one, doesn't intend to shoot 17 percent from three forever.\n\"My three-point percentage was the lowest ever in history. That's terrible,\" Stephenson said, per The Charlotte Observer. \"I have to come in and figure out how to be a better shooter. Being a good shooter will help my overall game. When people sag off of me (playing him to drive), it's harder for me to be successful.\n\"It's confidence\u2014just wanting the shot to go in so bad and then you lose your confidence. That plays a major part when you don't have confidence in your shot. This summer I'm going to find my confidence.\"\nWhile Stephenson spends his offseason trying to gain confidence, Al Jefferson will be doing his darndest to lose weight\u2014before and after he officially opts into the final year of his contract.\n\"I've got unfinished business here. That's not even an option for me,\" Jefferson said, per The Observer. \"Unless something dramatic changed, I can't see myself opting out, and leaving that bad taste in my mouth. And in the Charlotte Hornets' mouth. I can't walk away from that.\"\nWhat could be worse than a ninth straight year without playoff basketball for the Sacramento Kings? How about another tumultuous summer, perhaps one featuring DeMarcus Cousins' departure?\nRumors are already swirling about Boogie's availability, courtesy of head coach George Karl's candid comments on Monday.\n\"I've had some great players and I've never had one player that I have said is untradeable,\" Karl said, according to CSNBayArea.com's Bill Herenda. \"You always got to be ready for the possibility of a great trade that could come your way.\n\"I know I respect him (DeMarcus Cousins) a tremendous amount...I think our give and take and our communication has been almost on a daily basis...until we can really get to a special place together, I think we've got to continue to communicate, what he wants and what I want.\"\nThe relationship between star player and coach will be crucial to the Kings' fortunes going forward. Cousins and the Kings seemed ready to thrive early on, when they got off to a 9-6 start under Mike Malone. But Boogie's 10-game absence on account of viral meningitis gave Sacramento's higher-ups the daylight they needed to part ways with Malone. That move ushered in two months of rote mediocrity under interim coach Tyrone Corbin, before Karl came aboard during the All-Star break.\nThough a lukewarm convert to a faster tempo, he has thrived in a system that emphasizes spacing, passing and movement, not unlike Mike Krzyzewski's philosophy last summer with Team USA. It isn't a coincidence that Cousins had triple doubles in two of his last three games and is ranked fifth in the league in scoring (24.1), third in rebounding (12.7) and 11th in blocks (1.75).\nAnd, of course, first in the hearts of Sacramentans.\nCoaching played a pivotal role in the Denver Nuggets' ongoing doldrums this season.\nHead coach Brian Shaw continued to push his square-peg/round-hole approach by playing slow with a team and in a city for which a faster pace would have made more sense. His philosophy backfired, to the tune of a 20-39 start and a subsequent pink slip.\nAccording to Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski, the Nuggets' search for a long-term replacement is already underway. Melvin Hunt, the Nuggets' interim coach, will get a crack at it, though he'll hardly be the only one to get an interview. His competition will likely include former head coaches (Michael Malone, Mike D'Antoni, Alvin Gentry, Scott Skiles), current NBA assistants (Portland's David Vanterpool) and eager college guys looking to make the jump (Florida's Billy Donovan, Iowa State's Fred Hoiberg).\n\"I'm not a coach, but I do think we're Denver,\" said general manager Tim Connelly, per The Denver Post's Chris Dempsey. \"We've got to play with pace, we've got to play uptempo basketball. And uptempo basketball can take on various styles. We're certainly looking for a coach that understands how we've been successful in the past and probably how we'll be successful in the future, with fast basketball and playing with pace.\"\nWhatever hopes the Phoenix Suns had of battling for the West's No. 8 seed for the second year in a row went right out the window during a 1-10 stretch over the final three weeks of the 2014-15 season.\n\"I don't think that truly reflects where we are and the season we had,\" said Suns president Lon Babby during the team's exit interviews, according to AZCentral.com's Paul Coro.\nPerhaps not, though the fact that Phoenix bobbed its way into and out of the playoff race as often as it did was reflective of an unsteady situation on the court and in the locker room.\n\"We didn't have all guys that were just concerned with winning,\" head coach Jeff Hornacek said, per Coro. That much was clear once Goran Dragic publicly demanded a trade (and got his wish) and Isaiah Thomas followed him out the door at the February deadline, albeit to a different destination.\nAll told, the Suns' point guard experiment didn't pay off like they'd hoped. Fortunately for folks in Phoenix, the team will be flush with cap space to restock the roster, once the front office decides how to spend its fifth straight lottery pick.\n\"This year was more of a humbling experience,\" said general manager Ryan McDonough, per Coro. \"I think we'll all learn from it and get better from it and bounce back.\"\nA busy season will give way to an even busier summer for Detroit Pistons head coach/team president Stan Van Gundy. The shocking decision to cut Josh Smith in December breathed new life into the slumping squad. The trade-deadline arrival of Reggie Jackson eventually did the same, albeit after a slump in the wake of Brandon Jennings' Achilles tear.\n\"We made some progress\u2014not enough\u2014but some progress at both ends of the floor,\" Van Gundy said during his exit interview, according to MLive's Brendan Savage. \"Going forward, we feel like we've established a base of good young players. Over the last two-thirds of the year, which is not a small sample size, we played .500 basketball, which would have put us in the top five in the East over that time period.\n\"So we think things are looking up going forward.\"\nHow Detroit's fortunes fare from here on out will depend on what Van Gundy is able to accomplish from his front-office post this summer. Come July 1, Greg Monroe will be an unrestricted free agent, Jackson will be restricted, and Andre Drummond will be eligible for a sizable contract extension. Those three aside, the Pistons figure to make a pitch to at least one Michigan native: Golden State's Draymond Green.\nIf Van Gundy plays his cards right, his Pistons might (finally) be in position to snap their six-year playoff drought next spring.\nLast year, the Miami Heat finished up in the NBA Finals, fighting an ultimately futile battle for their third straight championship. This year, their summer will start two months earlier, without a seventh straight playoff appearance.\nThe biggest difference, of course, is LeBron James. He left South Beach; therefore, the sands aren't quite as warm as they otherwise would be for the Heat.\nBut the story of Miami's demise is much broader than that. Between Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Josh McRoberts, Luol Deng and Hassan Whiteside, the Heat racked up frequent flyer miles going to and from the training room to cover the cost of travel for their summer vacations.\n\"It's just tough, man,\" Deng told Bleacher Report's Ethan Skolnick. \"It's just been that type of year. It seemed like the whole year, we were always fighting and dealing with something, instead of staying consistent and just kind of playing our game. I'm not making excuses or anything, but no one on this team can tell you that they've had a consistent rhythm the entire year. It's been tough to be consistent. We've had guys in and out. You have different roles.\"\nThose roles may be more defined next season if Pat Riley has his way in the coming months. With better health and the retention of Goran Dragic and Deng, both opt-out candidates, the Heat could field one of the best starting fives not only in the East but in the entire league.\nLose either or both of those guys, though, and Miami's path back to relevance might not be so smooth.\nPaul George's comeback from his devastating leg injury serves as an all-too-perfect microcosm of the Indiana Pacers' season as a whole.\nLike their wounded superstar, the Pacers fought through pain, uncertainty and doubt to put themselves in position to control their own destiny at the end. Aside from George, Indiana had to survive lengthy stretches without stalwarts like David West and George Hill, along with newcomers Rodney Stuckey and C.J. Miles.\nAgainst all odds, the Pacers hung around the muck at the bottom of the Eastern Conference playoff picture, just in time for George to return to action. His mere presence gave Indiana a much-needed shot in the arm; the Pacers won their first five games with George in the rotation, despite him never playing more than 18 minutes in a given game.\nBut, on the final night of the season, the calf in George's other leg gave way, as did the Pacers' postseason hopes in Memphis.\n\"Just came off a screen and felt a pop, but they looked at it and it's nothing more than just a calf strain,\" George said afterward, according to The Indianapolis Star's Candace Buckner. \"It wasn't a knee injury but it's tough, you work so hard in rehab and have something else pop up. The good thing is, I know we've got a long summer and a lot to look forward to.\"\nSo do the Pacers, assuming West and Roy Hibbert\u2014both of whom can opt out of their contracts\u2014don't leave Naptown this summer.\nRussell Westbrook's response to his first scoring title could easily double as the Oklahoma City Thunder's thoughts on this lost season of theirs.\n\"S---. It doesn't mean nothing,\" Westbrook said after OKC's season-ending win over the Timberwolves, according to ESPN.com's Royce Young (h/t Bleacher Report). \"Good job. Hooray. I'm at home, watching other teams play. Doesn't mean nothing.\"\nWestbrook's disappointment is understandable, if not downright appropriate. He wound up with career highs in nearly every counting category, including points (28.1), assists (8.6), rebounds (7.3) and steals (2.1).\nBut Westbrook's best efforts weren't enough to overcome devastating injuries to Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. Nor could general manager Sam Presti's moves make up for those losses, though the additions of Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, D.J. Augustin and Kyle Singler should serve the Thunder well going forward.\nWith that supporting cast in place and its stars in better shape, OKC should find itself back in the title hunt next season.\nWhether Scott Brooks is there to guide the Thunder is another story. According to Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski, the team will evaluate its relationship with Brooks, who has one year left on his contract\u2014much like the injured superstar whose absence doomed OKC.\nLionel Hollins' assessment of his Brooklyn Nets' chances against the Atlanta Hawks was as harsh as it was accurate.\n\"I don't think we have any advantages over the Hawks,\" Hollins said, per The Brooklyn Game's Devin Kharpertian.\nThat may sell his team a bit short. Surely, Atlanta doesn't have anyone who can compare with Brook Lopez's size and skill in the post. Lopez finished the season on an absolute tear, averaging 23.7 points and 9.4 rebounds over a 16-game stretch that saw the Nets go 11-5.\nNor can the Hawks claim to boast the best individual perimeter player in this series. That distinction belongs to Brooklyn, courtesy of former ATL resident Joe Johnson.\nOther than those points of contention, Hollins is probably right. By and large, Brooklyn has been mediocre and uninspiring this season.\nThen again, as much of a sting as Hollins' comments may have carried, they still paled in comparison to the five-alarm fire that spewed out from Paul Pierce's mouth, courtesy of ESPN Boston's Jackie MacMullan.\nLost amid the hubbub over Paul Pierce ripping the Nets a new one in public were his comments regarding the Toronto Raptors, the Washington Wizards' first-round playoff opponent.\n\"We haven't done particularly well against Toronto, but I don't feel they have the 'It' that makes you worried,\" Pierce told ESPNBoston.com's Jackie MacMullan. \"There isn't a team I look at in the Eastern Conference that makes me say, 'They are intimidating, we don't have a chance.'\"\nTo Pierce's point, the Raptors swept the Wizards in their three regular-season meetings. But the most recent two of those tiffs were decided by a total of six points.\nAnd if the games are close between Toronto and Washington, Pierce certainly won't be one to hide from the moment, especially in Canada.\nForget about all the usual tropes about how terrible the Eastern Conference is and how that somehow degrades the Milwaukee Bucks' finish as the sixth seed. The fact that the Bucks are in the playoffs at all right now is nothing short of a Wisconsin miracle.\nMilwaukee won a league-worst 15 games last season and could have plunged back to similar depths this time around in light of all the setbacks this squad suffered over the course of 2014-15. Instead, the Bucks fought through injuries (Jabari Parker, Ersan Ilyasova, John Henson), trades (Brandon Knight) and outright defections (Larry Sanders) to nearly triple their win total from a season ago.\nAnd how, pray tell, did they do it? Among other things, behind a long-armed, switch-heavy defense\u2014orchestrated by head coach Jason Kidd\u2014that wound up second in the league in efficiency, per NBA.com.\nThese fans hate each other, too. This isn't a theory \u2014 it's scientific fact proven by years of mutual enmity between Bears and Packers fans. Now imagine that same level of anger and hostility, but on a basketball court. Spectacular, right? Joakim Noah calling Giannis Antetokounmpo soft in the playoffs could create our first Internet civil war. Now imagine future battles between Chicago South Side natives and Simeon's own Jabari Parker and Derrick Rose. I can't take it.\nThe Boston Celtics needed quite a bit of outside help to secure a spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Between the Cleveland Cavaliers resting their stars during a recent home-and-home with Boston and the rest of the East's fringes falling off, the C's benefited from a conference-wide \"effort\" to get them into the postseason\u2014in addition to their own 24-12 surge over the final 36 games.\nBut it was another outside assist that might have given a certain Celtic the extra energy he needed to nudge this scrappy squad up the standings. According to The Boston Globe's Adam Himmelsbach, Isiah Thomas\u2014who had his fair share of battles with the C's as a member of the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons in the 1980s\u2014texted words of encouragement to Isaiah Thomas upon the latter's arrival in Beantown at the Feb. 19 trade deadline.\n\"This is gonna change your career,\" Zeke wrote. \"They're one game out of the playoffs. Lead them to the playoffs.\"\nThat's precisely what the younger Thomas did while averaging 19 points and 5.4 assists off the bench.\nThomas could use a few more texts like that from his almost-namesake in the days to come, as his C's prepare to take on LeBron James' Cavs in the first round of the playoffs.\nNo team did more to boost its collective stock after the All-Star Game than the Utah Jazz. Once the break came and went, the Jazz went 19-10\u2014the fifth-best record in the West\u2014while holding opponents to a league-low 94.8 points per 100 possessions, per NBA.com.\nEnes Kanter's trade-deadline departure and Rudy Gobert's subsequent explosion as a starter had plenty to do with that. For his efforts, Gobert figures to garner plenty of votes for Most Improved and Defensive Player of the Year honors.\nOf course, Gobert wasn't the sole reason Utah finished with a record good enough to qualify for the playoffs in the East. Gordon Hayward's borderline All-NBA play had plenty to do with it, as did Derrick Favors'. As Grantland's Zach Lowe wrote of that duo, \"They've been really good on both ends, and Hayward carried Utah's offense without much help from any perimeter threat until Rodney Hood emerged over the last 25 games.\"\n\"Clearly we sit here today in a better position than when we started,\" general manager Dennis Lindsey said during the team's exit interviews, according to The Salt Lake Tribune's Aaron Falk. \"The group is moving in the right direction.\"\nIf three-point shooting is, indeed, all the rage in the NBA, then the Toronto Raptors are as fashionable as any team around. They finished among the top 10 in three-point makes and attempts, went 19-2 when they made more than 10 threes in a given game and became the second team in league history with five players who knocked down at least 100 treys apiece.\nThe only other team to pull that off? The 2008-09 Knicks.\nOf course, this year's Raptors fared far better than those Knicks did. New York lost 50 games that year. Toronto, on the other hand, fell just one win shy of 50 on the other side of the ledger but still came away with a second straight Atlantic Division title and a franchise record for victories in a single season.\nNext up: a first-round date with the shooting-averse Wizards, whom the Raptors swept during the regular season.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers aren't short of reasons to worry about their postseason prospects. Their wing depth has been decimated by injuries, with Wesley Matthews, Arron Afflalo, Nicolas Batum, Dorell Wright and C.J. McCollum all falling victim. Worse still, the Blazers will have to begin their playoff push on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies.\nHalfway through the season, Portland looked like a dark-horse contender \u2014 a two-way powerhouse seasoned with rare roster continuity and some playoff experience. Their starters could hit the marks of Terry Stotts's \"flow\" offense while wearing blindfolds, and they had improbably sharpened into a borderline top-five defensive team.\nDespite the doom and gloom around Rip City, the Blazers still have two huge factors in their favor: LaMarcus Aldridge and Damian Lillard. Those two carried Portland past Houston in last year's playoffs, combining for 55.3 points, 17.5 rebounds and 8.7 assists in a six-game victory.\nThe Memphis Grizzlies won't exactly be a picture of health for their first-round series against Portland, either. Marc Gasol returned from a sprained ankle in time for the Grizzlies' season finale, but he wasn't joined by Mike Conley and Tony Allen. They've been sidelined by foot and hamstring injuries, respectively, and may remain so for some time, per The Commercial Appeal's Ronald Tillery.\nThose absences figure to be massively problematic for Memphis, despite the decimation that Portland has suffered. As much as the Grizzlies' universe revolves around Gasol and Zach Randolph in the middle, it's Conley, who would otherwise be charged with checking Damian Lillard, and Allen (aka \"The Grindfather\") who serve as the heart and soul of this squad.\nThere are many ways to compare the strength of the West to the weakness of the East, but perhaps none is more striking than where the Dallas Mavericks stand at season's end.\nIn the Western Conference, the Mavs' 50 wins were only good enough to snag the seventh seed. Were Dallas an Eastern Conference squad, it would start the playoffs at No. 3, matched up against the Bucks in the first round.\nInstead, the Mavs will have to face the Houston Rockets in a series whose subplots have their own subplots.\n\"That's for the media to talk about,\" Dirk Nowitzki said, referring to the off-court drama between Mavs owner Mark Cuban and Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, per Mavs.com's Earl K. Sneed. \"That's for fun little side notes, I guess, which the players don't really care that much about. It's about which team comes out at the end. Obviously, they have home-court advantage. We'd love to go down there and steal one or steal the first one, but it's going to be tough.\"\nIt'll be even tougher if Chandler Parsons\u2014one of the sticking points in the ongoing feud between these two teams\u2014isn't ready to play in Game 1. He missed the last six games of the regular season while resting his swollen right knee.\nHead coach Rick Carlisle, though, is confident that Parsons will be available. Parsons' offensive versatility and familiarity with Dallas' Texas foe will be vital to the Mavs' attempt to spring the seeded upset.\nFor every transcendent superstar, there is an initial foray into the playoffs, one that sets the stage for the years to come.\nIn 2006, LeBron James averaged about 31 points, eight boards and six assists while carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers to a second-round loss against the Detroit Pistons. In 2010, Kevin Durant poured in 25 points per game (albeit on a subpar 35 percent shooting) in a six-game loss to the eventual-champion Lakers.\nWhat will 2015 bring for Anthony Davis? Probably not much in the way of victories. His New Orleans Pelicans will have to contend with a Golden State Warriors squad that is coming off a historically great regular season.\nHowever Davis fares from here on out, folks in the Crescent City won't soon forget what The Brow did to put the Pelicans back into the playoffs for the first time since 2011, when they were still the New Orleans Hornets. In what was, to date, the biggest game of his NBA career, Davis dominated the streaking San Antonio Spurs, piling up 31 points, 13 rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks in 43 minutes of a 108-103 win for New Orleans.\n\"Honestly, I know I all told ya'll before this game it didn't mean nothing, but I tried to downplay it because I didn't want to get too excited,\" Davis said afterward, via ESPN. \"It meant a lot\u2014and we played like it meant something.\nNow, they'll have to locate their hearts and put them back in place, lest they let the Warriors stomp them from the get-go.\nPhysically speaking, Derrick Rose may not be the same player he was prior to his three knee surgeries. But from a confidence standpoint, he's as sturdy as ever.\n\"I believe I'm one of the best players in the NBA...still,\" Rose insisted, even after leaving the Chicago Bulls' season finale early with soreness in his left knee, per ESPN.com's Nick Friedell.\nThe Bulls can only hope Rose's confidence will pay actual dividends in the playoffs. With Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson and Kirk Hinrich all battling injuries, Chicago will need whatever it can squeeze out of the former MVP if it's going to be more than a dark horse in the East.\nAfter all the ups and downs, the injuries and roster changes, the Houston Rockets wound up with the No. 2 seed in the West\u2014which probably beats out most preseason predictions.\nIt's one thing to snag such prime seeding on the strength of James Harden's MVP-caliber campaign. It's another thing to capitalize on it.\nTo that end, the Rockets may have help on the way if they can stay alive long enough. Patrick Beverley, who was recently ruled out for the season after undergoing wrist surgery, could be back at point guard in Houston...assuming the team hasn't been eliminated by mid-May.\n\"I don't care about the pain. I can play through pain. I've been playing through all type of stuff the whole year, so I can play with the pain,\" Beverley told Fox26 Sports' Mark Berman. \"I just have to get this cast off. When the cast comes off May 18, May 20th, wrap it up with tape and (I'll) be good to go. I don't care how weak it is. I don't care how strong it is. I don't care about that.\n\"As soon as this cast is off I'm back to business.\"\nIn the meantime, the Rockets will have to contend with the likes of Rajon Rondo and Tony Parker at the point, with the hope that whatever Harden, Dwight Howard and their supporting cast can do will be enough to see Houston through to the Western Conference Finals.\nHowever and whenever the Atlanta Hawks' surprising season winds up, they can take pride in what they've accomplished together. Despite turmoil at the front-office and ownership levels, the Hawks managed to set new franchise records for consecutive wins (19), All-Stars (four) and total single-season victories, among other things.\nIn the bigger picture, the Hawks earned the respect of the rest of the league, which could pay off handsomely (i.e., via free-agent signings) in the years to come.\n\"I think there's been a couple of times during a game, end of games, when we're gonna win, and the other team will come up and say 'man, I love how you guys play,'\" Kyle Korver told NBA.com's David Aldridge. \"They just got, you can tell, they're like, I would love to play for your team. That's the ultimate sign of respect in the NBA. When you're on a team, and your team's supposedly good, but man, I'd rather be on your team. It feels good to hear that.\"\nYou know what would beat that? The Hawks' first trip to the penultimate round of the playoffs since 1970.\nRemember when all the Chicken Littles huddled in northeast Ohio (and across the country, for that matter) were wondering why the sky was falling on the Cleveland Cavaliers and how they'd ever survive it?\nA second-place conference finish did wonders to erase memories of the panic that set in amid the Cavs' disappointing 19-20 start. Cleveland now looks like the favorite to win the East (and a co-favorite to win it all), thanks in no small part to a second half that saw the Cavs win 34 of 43 games.\nWell, maybe not right away. The Cavs should make quick work of the Celtics in Round 1.\nAfter that, though, Cleveland's path through Chicago and Atlanta will put this team's title-contending chops to the test.\nThere were eight scenarios for a first-round playoff opponent for the Clippers heading into Wednesday\u2019s final day of the regular season.\nFour of the scenarios had the Clippers playing the Memphis Grizzlies for the third time in four years.\nTwo of the scenarios had them facing Dallas and one had them meeting Houston in the first round.\nThe last scenario \u2013 a scenario some would classify as worst-case \u2013 had the Clippers, the league\u2019s second-hottest team, facing the San Antonio Spurs, the hottest.\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, the worst case became the reality.\nThe Clippers, though, aren't about to complain about their cruel fate. \"I'd rather go through them now while we're fresh,\" said DeAndre Jordan, per ESPN.com's Arash Markazi.\nThey'll have to hope that their own season-ending hot streak (seven in a row, 14 of 15) gives them enough juice to overcome a San Antonio Spurs squad that was riding an 11-game spurt prior to a defeat to the Pelicans in the finale.\nHas there ever been a stronger sixth seed in any postseason in any sport than this year's San Antonio Spurs? All they did was win 11 games in a row and 21 of 24 prior to the season's final night. They might have made it 12 in a row and 22 of 25 if not for a poor opening to what turned out to be a 108-103 defeat in New Orleans.\n\"That first half was the worst we've played in a long time,\" head coach Gregg Popovich said afterward, via ESPN. \"The Pelicans were on fire. They were committed. They were playing hard. They had a lot to play for and it showed.\"\nThe Spurs had plenty to play for themselves. A win would have locked them into the No. 2 seed in the West as the Southwest Division champions, with a first-round matchup against the Mavericks. Instead, San Antonio will begin its title defense in L.A., opposite a Clippers team that the Spurs swept out of the second round three years ago.\nTiago Splitter's ongoing calf troubles have cast some doubt on San Antonio's chances of repeating. But if the Spurs can get him back in time for the Western Conference Finals, they'll pose a serious threat to Golden State's dream season.\nA great regular season guarantees the Golden State Warriors nothing more than the No. 1 seed in the West and a pitfall-filled path to the NBA Finals.\nAnd, of course, the No. 1 spot in the last power rankings of the regular season.\nTo be sure, the Dubs didn't just coast their way to the top. Rather, they fought to the very end for each of the 67 wins they racked up.\nStephen Curry certainly didn't take anything for granted. Over the final 18 games of the season, the presumptive MVP knocked down 52.3 percent of his long-range looks on the way to shattering his own record for single-season three-point makes (286).\nAs easy as Golden State made the regular season seem, the playoffs will look like anything but that. First comes figuring out how to contain Anthony Davis. Then, the Warriors will likely have to contend with the \"Grit-N-Grind\" Grizzlies.\nAnd before the Dubs can book their first trip to the Finals in 40 years, the defending champion Spurs will have a word or two to offer.\nGolden State had better hope, then, that the same stroke that helped Curry knocked down more than half of his treys over the last month of the season and another 77 in a row in a single practice holds true during the pressure cooker of the playoffs.\nJosh Martin covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.

    "text": "Next up is the point & figure chart for GLD, the gold exchange traded fund. It shows a bullish trend with a significant upside price projection.\nBelow is one of our favorites: the long term chart of gold going back to 1975.\nAs you can clearly see, prices peaked in the late 70's at over $750.00, and have recently rallied up to $730.40. In the process a cup formation has been constructed on the chart. Presently gold has been in a trading range just below the rim of the cup on the right hand side of the chart.\nIf the POG rallies back up through its $730.40 high and on through $750.00 - a very strong cup with a handle formation will be in place with a break out that would signify the gold bull is very strong and entering a new phase. We expect that to happen this year, possibly within a few months time.\nNext is the industrial metals compared to the price of gold. Since late October of 2006 gold has been out performing the industrial metals, which prior to that time had been the leader.\nSince the peak in late October of 2006, gold has been out performing until about mid-Feb. of 2007. From mid-Feb. to mid-March the industrial metals rallied back to their fib retracement level of 61.8%, and have since started to fall once again, meaning gold has been out performing as of late.\nBelow is the chart of the silver exchange traded fund (SLV). It is presently right at the top of a resistance band and is trying to break out above. A close above 135 that holds would be bullish.\nThe second chart below is the point and figure chart for silver, which shows a bullish price projection of $21.50.\nThe Hui Index was down 3.20 for the week, closing out at 337.66 (-0.94%). The daily chart below shows a symmetrical triangle that is getting narrower by the day. Price will soon break out to the upside or downside.\nNotice the series of higher lows that have been kept in place. Significant resistance resides overhead just over the 360 level.\nNext up is another daily chart of the Hui; this one has a much shorter time frame, and tends to focus in on the more recent price action.\nNotice the Bollinger bands on the chart. The upper BB is at 348.67 and the lower one is at 315.60. In between the two is the middle band at 332.17.\nThe index just recently banged up against the upper BB line and has since retreated to 337.66, which is 5 points above the middle BB. If prices do not hold right around the middle band then the lower band will become a target. Stochastics are turning over and down.\nBelow is the point and figure chart for gold that shows a bullish price project of 412.\nReadings of 5 or higher have coincided with oversold levels and market bottoms. A spike back above 5 from which the ratio has recently fallen would most likely give a good entry point.\nBelow are some gold stocks that we own or have owned in our portfolio and are watching for further possible accumulation.\nWe are cautious with the overall stock market and sense there is more downside to come. We prefer to stay on the sidelines except with selected precious metal and energy stocks.\nEven with the pm and energy stocks one most remain cautious, as any serious downdraft in the overall market will most likely affect all stocks. We do not see any imminent danger, but storm clouds on the distant horizon.\nAny surprises with interest rates will be to the upside. This is because of the derivative mess and carry trade orgies, which when they start to unwind will cause quite a stir.\nThe world is afloat with paper fiat debt money. The sub-prime problems will get worse before they get better, not only in the US but elsewhere as well.\nThe Fed and other CB's will react to these events as they do to all events: they create more credit and debt. This will not be unseen by gold, as a matter of fact gold will sound the warning before hand.\nShort term the gold stocks appear overbought and in need of a bit more rest/consolidation before beginning a sustainable leg up. We look to accumulate selected stocks on weakness that holds above previous lows.\nStop by our website and check out the complete market wrap, which covers most major markets. There is also a lot of information on gold and silver, not only from an investment point of view, but also from its position as being the mandated monetary system of our Constitution - Silver and Gold Coins as in Honest Weights and Measures.\nThere is also a live bulletin board where you can discuss the markets with people from around the world and many other resources too numerous to list. Drop by and check it out. Good luck. Good trading. Good health. And that's a wrap.",

    "text": "\"And they're off!\" My grandpa would begin one of his classic jokes. In the fast-paced clip of a horse race announcer, he continued, \"It's cabbage by a head, carrot in a bunch. Toothpaste being squeezed out on the rail.\n\"And Diaper, bringing up the rear!\" That last sentence always came with a special gravitas.\nIt was a perennial favorite. We would ask him to tell it to us again and again. Recalling it now, I can still clearly hear his voice.\nThose familiar words came back to me yesterday.\nThe day after Halloween, and the holiday season is upon us. So often it feels like the gates opening with the crack of a starting pistol as we bear, full speed ahead, towards the Thanksgiving and Christmas.\nPart of the joy of the holidays is the sense of anticipation they create. Sharing them today fulfills some of my own anticipation. After testing pie crusts and sampling fillings, those recipes are now displayed on magazine racks around the country, and I finally get to share the tear sheets. I think the images are among the best that Stephen and I have worked on together.\nI hope you enjoy this visual taste of the holiday sweets to come. For the recipes, get your copy of Simply Gluten-Free.\nMy great grandmother Virginia Goettl sat at the kitchen table of my parents' Denver apartment when someone started the tape recorder.\n\"I was born in 1906 in Europe,\" she began. \"I was a year old when I\u2014\"\nMy grandma, Virginia's daughter Betty, cut in. \"Whereabouts in Europe, mom?\"\n\"I was born in Bosnia... Bosnia was a province of Austria-Hungary that they recaptured from the Turks in the early 1800s,\" she explained after my hearing-impaired grandpa mistakenly thought she said Boston.\nIt was a quiet family evening in August 1982. My parents were there (my mom was seven months pregnant with me) with my grandparents and my dad's cousin Julie. You can hear the sound of plates being cleared in the background as my dad and grandma set out to capture Virginia's story. \"Okay, what we wanted to record mostly was about history, about family history...\" Betty starts to explain at the beginning of the tape.\nEarlier this year, I borrowed the three tapes they created, and started what I've come to call the \"Family History Project.\" My great grandparents had a life of unplanned adventure after my great grandpa John was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1929. Their story is beyond the scope of a single blog post.\nThose tapes, though, and some of the simple and straightforward statements that emerged from them have shed unexpected light on questions I've had about my family history.\nSince my first family recipes post about kiffels, I've wondered why my \"German\" family prepared so much Hungarian food.\nWe have a cookbook of different family recipes that my aunt collected for a reunion in 1999. All of the ones attributed to Virginia indicate a strong eastern European influence. And it's not just hers, but several of her relatives' recipes for goulash and paprikash, as well as my mom's kiffels, all point to a past situated well outside the borders I grew up associating with my family.\nI don't have all the answers for why my family continually talked about their strong German roots yet were actually located in the southeastern territories of Austria-Hungary.\nBut the straightforward sentence, \"I was born in Bosnia,\" explains why I grew up with the hearty and comforting flavors of foods infused with Hungarian paprika.\nIt made me excited to try a recipe for \"Real Hungarian Goulash,\" that my Aunt BJ submitted, explaining that her Aunt Helene Kailer made the stew for her after her first son was born. Preparing the simple, tomato-based beef stew connected me to a part of my family's past that I now perceive more clearly.\nI will continue exploring the various facets involved in my Family History Project, examining how a disease led the Goettls from Ohio, through the Deep South, and eventually landed them in Phoenix, Arizona. I can see that path laid out in the food we love, and the recipes we've shared with one another.\nSo, we'll start at the beginning, with the Hungarian food that I grew up believing was German. Here is Aunt Helene's goulash. And, as my mom was careful to instruct me, be sure to get the Hungarian paprika in the red tin! It's the best.\n1. In a dutch oven or stock pot, heat oil to low. Add chopped onion and cook slowly until onions are transparent (about 15 minutes).\n2. Add red bell pepper and continue to saut\u00e9 until tender (5-10 more minutes), stirring regularly.\n3. Cover the onions and peppers with the stew meat, and allow meat to brown.\n4. Stir in paprika and tomato paste, and then add enough water to cover the meat. Add carrots (if desired). Cover and let cook over low to medium-low heat for 1 1/2 hours, uncovering the pot for the last 30 minutes so that the stew thickens slightly.\n5. Serve over noodles, and garnish with parsley.\nA warm and crispy hash brown potato shell filled with cheese, eggs, and sausage. In my family, this particular breakfast was a staple of potluck brunches, family gatherings, and, most memorably, Christmas morning. It\u2019s easy\u2014spread the hash browns in a pie plate, layer in sausage and cheese, and then pour in a few whisked eggs on top. The result is an appetite-inducing, eye-pleasing addition to the breakfast table.\nWhen Simply Gluten-Free Magazine asked us to work on a brunch menu for the March/April issue, this breakfast casserole was one of the first recipes I thought to include. A few phone calls to mom, and I had the details of the recipe sorted. It became my favorite part of a story on hearty brunch dishes that I ended up developing, which also included a potato medley hash and a creamy grits bar (a nod to my adopted home in the South). Working on these recipes gave me a chance to write about one of my favorite ways to share breakfast: a gathering of fellow soccer fans on a Saturday morning to watch English Premier League soccer and cheer on our favorite team, Chelsea FC (Go Blues!).\nThe breakfast casserole had the most personal significance to me. Like Mom\u2019s Chicken Soup, it conjures up happy memories. This time, it's Christmas morning and I can instantly see mom behind the stove in the little kitchen of our house in Longmont, Colorado, pouring the egg mixture into the pie plate just before popping it into the oven. Those memories make it a favorite family recipe. It\u2019s also a recipe for classic comfort food. This recipe is durable, satiating, and delicious. And it\u2019s versatile. It will always be a crowd pleasure with breakfast sausage and cheddar, but swap in swiss and use turkey sausage or even ham and it will be equally tasty. For a healthier option, one could do egg whites and toss in some chopped kale or spinach, or make it vegetarian by eliminating the meat entirely.\nIt\u2019s the perfect recipe for the cook who loves to experiment. A few ingredients, simple instructions, and a world of possibilities\u2014I\u2019m increasingly convinced those are the elements behind a family favorite that just about anyone can enjoy.\nBreakfast casserole that I food and prop styled for Simply Gluten-Free Magazine. Photo by Stephen DeVries.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown hash brown, flipping them once (about 3 minutes on each side).\nMold hash browns into a 9-inch pie plate.\nLayer turkey sausage on top of the potatoes, then add the shredded cheese.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, half & half, salt, and pepper. Pour mixture over cheese layer.\nNote: The hash browns do not need to be fully cooked before placing them in the pie plate, and slightly undercooked potatoes will make for a firmer casserole crust.\nGrowing up, I counted my grandma among my biggest heroes. She always had things for us to do, and new adventures to embark upon. From homemade fetticini noodles, to little water color painting sets and embroidering lessons, to kitchen-sink science experiments\u2014everything we did had a little lesson to be learned, a nugget of knowledge to take away. I can see so much of who I've become in the natural curiosity she helped cultivate in me.\nGrandma \"running eggs\" at their chicken farm in Colorado. She was nothing if not a hard and dedicated worker.\nWas our celebration of George Washington's birthday a little silly? Perhaps. I suppose the whole idea was birthed out of trips to Colonial Williamsburg, and a shared love for history among my parents and grandparents. As a kid, it was full of imaginative possibilities. No wonder I went on to pursue history full-time. The best part was that grandma never broke character. There was no cynicism in her recreation, no laughing at herself, only a little flair for the dramatic. It lent gravitas to the scene, and made it that much more realistic and significant to everyone else.\nA young me, proudly posing before our dimly-lit colonial dinner table. Apparently, they pulled out all the stops in George Washington's day with blue paper napkins.\nThe memories of George Washington's birthday came back to me while making my mom's chicken soup the other day. Since my immediate family no longer lives in Colorado, and my grandparents' farm\u2014the setting for the birthday festivities\u2014was sold 20 years ago, food has become an important link to fond memories of the past. As I smelled the soup on the stove, I thought, \"It smells like home.\" Not our physical house, but the feeling of being at home. If the smell of home exists, for me, it is made-from-scratch chicken soup.\nI don't remember exactly what we ate during the birthday. Considering grandpa's sweet tooth, I have no doubt that a historically inaccurate cake was involved, probably of the chocolate variety. Whatever else was on the table, I'm sure it was hearty, warm, and satisfying\u2014like my mom's soup.\nSo in honor of George Washington's upcoming birthday, and the precious memories I have attached to it, I thought I'd share mom's soup recipe. It cooks slowly, as good things do. Hopefully it will warm your heart the same way it continues to warm mine.\nHeat oil in the bottom of a large stock pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion, and stir regularly until onion is clear \u2014 about 2 minutes.\nAdd the whole chicken (including the skin and bones) to the pot, and add enough water to cover. After water begins to boil, reduce heat to a simmer with cover slightly ajar for 2-3 hours, or until chicken is completely cooked and the meat is coming off of the bone.\nTurn stove back to medium heat, and return strained broth to the stock pot.\nWhile allowing the chicken to cool slightly, chop the carrots and celery and add them to the broth.\nSkin and debone the chicken. Then return the meat to the stock pot.\nAdd rice, and allow the pot to simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nAdd salt and pepper to taste, and/or a chicken bouillon to enhance the flavor.\nTop with chopped parsley before serving.\nAllowing the chicken to cool slightly before deboning eases the process, and makes the fatty tissue and bones much easier to remove \u2014 it will also keeps you from scorching your fingertips.\nThis soup freezes well, and makes great leftovers. My mom always said the second bowl was the best.\nIf you're looking for a little extra kick, throw in some hot sauce for added spice. Trust me, it's delicious.\nMy Twitter feed is an eclectic hodgepodge. There will be 140 characters worth of organizing ideas from Real Simple, followed by a thoughtful question about women and faith from Rachel Held Evans, and then there's the Arabic-language update with news from Cairo. In a way, it's evidence of the many directions my life has taken in the last four years. And as Twitter reminded me a few days ago, I just passed my four-year \"Twitterversary.\"\nStephen while stuck on an icy Hwy 280 for four hours.\nLate-January is full of odd anniversaries for me. Yesterday, Facebook was abuzz with recollections of the South's Snowmageddon from a year before. People across the region were hit by a surprise snow and ice storm that left them either stuck in their cars or abandoning them and walking home. Kids and teachers couldn't leave school. I had the good fortune of only making a four-hour round trip drive to Tuscaloosa, while Stephen's casual drive to Home Depot turned into a 12-hour trek across town that included walking six-miles in the ice. I have not gone a week in the last year without hearing someone regaling their experiences during that storm, or relating my own.\nBut something strange occurred to me during those frozen, snowed-in days last January. They marked three years since I was also stuck at home, but this time for a completely different reason. On January 25, 2011, the Egyptian Revolution started, and like so many other millions, I was there. With tight curfews and no police force, people generally stayed close to home. That's when I joined Twitter. It had become the most effective way to track the news\u2014at least until Mubarak turned off the internet. Three years later, I found myself again feeling simultaneously cut off and exhilarated. Yet in January 2014 I ultimately felt safe and secure, just a little bit cold. In Cairo, things were much less certain, and while I did not feel I was directly in harm's way, our circumstances were defined by a lack of security.\nMe after evacuating Cairo in early February, and making my way to Cambridge, UK A cozy seat at a warm pub with a good friend was exactly what I needed. Photo by Galina Mardilovich.\nAs people have continued to recount their Snowmageddon experiences for the last year, there has been a cathartic quality to all of it. People were traumatized. And trauma leaves a deep psychological mark. It has to be expunged, and for me and the Southerners around me that meant talking about it.\nIt would have been awkward to bring up in those conversations how privileged we are to be able to talk and laugh about our experiences. To be able to recount our trauma and breath a large sigh of relief with smiles on our face at the end.\nNot everyone gets to recall their trauma that way. Not everyone gets such quick relief. For those most hopeful in Tahrir Square in 2011, their dreams of democracy and real change have been largely dissolved by a new military dictatorship.\nIt was 50\u02daF in Birmingham one year after Snowmageddon. It was literally a warm balm on the storm's temporary wounds. At the same time, Egypt's revolution is being recalled with images of the new leadership's most recent victims\u2014Shaima Al-Shabbagh brutal shooting in the midst of a peaceful anniversary protest and the death of at least 18 other people.\nThere is no need to diminish the trauma of last year's storm. But there's a perspective we could take in recalling our own discomfort\u2014one where we realize that we found quick relief where so many others are still waiting.\nWhen it comes to holiday traditions, Easter can be confusing. For many Christians the celebration of Christ\u2019s resurrection stands at the heights of the sacred calendar. Yet most of traditional practices \u2014 including the name of the holiday \u2014 have pagan roots. Where did the word Easter and its bunny come from? Well, that would be a reference to Eostre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of fertility whose sign was a rabbit.\nWhile the Easter table might lack the kind of nostalgic grounding in tradition that one experiences at Thanksgiving and Christmas, I find this freeing. For us, Easter has become a time to create new holiday memories and traditions with our friends. Since it takes a two-hour drive or a four-hour flight to spend the holiday with family, I try to incorporate family by including some traditional family recipes on the menu.\nFor this year, I\u2019ve adopted the traditional Hungarian kiffel (something we usually eat at Christmas) to our celebration of the resurrection. The kiffel combines cream cheese pastry and a touch of jam for a mixture of savory and sweet that\u2019s hard to resist. This also kicks off a series on traditional family recipes that I plan to continue sharing on the blog. I figure, what better way to explore the history of what we eat, than to delve into the foods I associate with my family history?\nWhenever I eat a kiffel, I think of my dad sneaking a few each time he passed through the kitchen and my mom telling him to save some for the rest of us. It makes them all the more special to think about my grandma and great grandma making them before me. While our families will be celebrating Easter across the country, our little Alabama duo will think of them fondly and enjoy a cookie in their honor. It\u2019s not a bunny or an egg \u2014 but who said those had all that much to do with celebrating the resurrection in the first place?\nUsing a fork or pastry cutter, cut in cold butter and cream cheese.\nWorking with your hands add in sour cream and egg yolk so that the dough forms a soft ball. Be careful not over mix the dough \u2014 if it has a marbled look, that\u2019s okay.\nDivide into two balls, wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour (can be refrigerated overnight).\nWorking one ball at a time, unwrap roll out on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with tapioca starch. Roll out dough until it is 1/8 inch thick.\nCut dough into 2\u201d squares and place a 1/2 tsp. of filling in the center. Fold into triangles or cylinders.\n*My information on the history of Easter came from Cathy K. Kaufman\u2019s \u201cEaster\u201d entry in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America (1ed.), Andrew F. Smith, ed., Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. Accessed online at http://www.oxfordreference.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780195154375.001.0001/acref-9780195154375-e-0280?rskey=iQtsmi&result=7 on 18 Apr. 2014.\nIt sits perched in the health food aisle of the grocery store \u2014 bags of flax seed lined up among the organic granola, peanut butter, and other natural, specialty foods. I sprinkle a little of it on my breakfast yogurt nearly every morning. Some even use a combination of flax seed and water to replace eggs when baking. While flax has become a fixture in the modern market for green living, its journey into today\u2019s diets was more laborious and nuanced than one might expect.\nThe original production of flax focused on textiles rather than dietary consumption. Flax is the plant behind linen, and historically its value comes from its fibers, not its seeds. Cultivation of flax for linen was especially prominent in northern Europe, where people in France, Flanders, Germany, and Ireland began cultivating the crop as early as the Bronze Age (2300-500 BC in Europe) and the practice rose to prominence during the medieval period.\nWith St. Patrick\u2019s Day just around the corner, and Stephen and I planning a trip to Ireland for later this month, it seemed appropriate to give a few details on the Irish experience of flax production. For the Irish, linen became especially profitable by the late-seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, by which time the British government began investing in expanding linen production. While traveling in Ireland, Arthur Young, an Englishman, remarked, somewhat condescendingly, on the importance of linen to the Irish economy, commenting, \u201cThe only considerable manufacture in Ireland which carries in all its parts the appearance of industry is the linen, and it ought never to be forgotten that this is solely confined to the protestant parts of the kingdom...\u201d Young continued that considering the French example, this was not to say that the Catholics were incapable of such production, but that the Irish Catholics of the south had yet to capitalize on linen in the same way as the northern Irish protestants. Apparently, even the history of flax and linen are riddled with the confessional divisions of Anglo-Irish, Protestant-Catholic rivalry that run throughout Irish history.\nYoung was right in seeing the promise of commercialization in the linen market. By 1810 farmers had sewn 70,000 acres with flax, and that number more than doubled by the 1850s when flax grew on some 175,000 acres. But the mid-nineteenth century also saw blight to potato crops and the devastating Irish Potato Famine, which left a million people dead and saw another 1.5 million emigrate, mostly to the United States. While that traumatic and devastating loss is responsible for the growth of a robust Irish heritage in the U.S., it also marked the decline of the Irish linen industry.\nThe flax seeds \u2014 a byproducts of linen production \u2014 not only became an eventual ingredient in health food, but the oil derived from pressing the seeds, known as linseed oil, is used in oil paints, varnishes, and linoleum.\nWhat does all of this have to do with the Linzer Torte, you might ask. Well not a whole lot, except that the Linzer Torte traditionally uses walnut flour \u2014 something that I am allergic to, so I thought I\u2019d try an alternative. I combined almond flour and flax seed meal to arrive at a delicious and hearty crust for my torte. When I started thinking about what laid behind that creation, I decided to explore the history of flax in greater detail.\n2 1/2 sticks butter - cold, unsalted, and cubed.\nOptional: 1 cup slivered almonds.\nNote: You can make the torte as either a circle or a square. This recipe makes enough for two 9 inch round pans, two 8 inch square pans, or one 9x13 rectangular pan. Because I wanted to cut mine into square bars (as opposed to wedges) I opted for the single 9x13 pan. If you are making a circular torte, it is preferable to use a cake pan with a removable bottom.\nStir together the almond flour, flax seed meal, and sugar.\nIn a large bowl stir gluten-free flour, cinnamon, clove, and salt together until well blended.\nWith a fork or pastry blender, work cubes of butter into the almond and flax mixture until it as a course, crumbly texture.\nStir in the sugar, almond, and flax seed mixture.\nIn a small dish, beat together the egg, egg yolk, and lemon zest until combined, then stir into almond and flax crumbs.\nGently kneed the dough to fully incorporate the egg mixture, and the dough forms into a ball.\nDivide dough in half if making one torte, or into quarters if making two.\nPlace one portion into the bottom of the pan and use your fingers to press it evenly across the pan and about 1 1/2 inches up the side of the pan. It should be evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan, but does not need to be smooth.\nBake the shell or shells for 12 min.\nWhile the shell(s) bake, roll out the remaining dough between sheets of wax or parchment paper until it is 1/4 inch thickness, and one inch bigger than the pan. Then place it in the freezer to chill for approx. 20 min.\nRemove shell(s) from the oven and let cool slightly.\nI put dry, gluten-free bread in the food processor to create my bread crumbs until it was as fine as possible.\nStir jam until it is soft, and spread it across the shell(s).\nRemove dough from freezer and cut into 1/2 inch wide strips, cutting through the dough and waxed paper. Use the lift the waxed paper, and place the strip, dough side down, onto the filling.\nMy dough was fairly stiff after coming out of the freezer, so I was able to handle it without cutting through the wax paper.\nArrange strips on a diagonal about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch apart, layering them in a criss-cross patterns to make the lattice top.\nMy dough was not pliable enough to weave into a traditional lattice, but layering them on the diagonal still created a nice, diamond-shaped effect.\nUse leftover pieces to fill in any gaps.\nMix egg yolk with water and brush all of the lattice and border. Sprinkle with slivered almonds, if desired.\nBake torte for 45 to 60 minutes.\nRemove from oven and place on rack.\nFor best flavor leave the torte or tortes stand uncovered overnight before serving.\nNote: I adapted my recipe from one posted last December on Smitten Kitchen. If you are looking for a traditional recipe that uses walnuts, I would recommend following her example.\n*Earlier this month I had the opportunity to share my experience of being diagnosed with celiac and going gluten free with fresh style magazine. I shared a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, and my go-to gluten-free flour blend on the magazine's blog, You can download a printable version of the recipe for the cookies and the flour blend here.\nInformation on the history of flax and linen came from The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages, and The Oxford Companion to Irish History.

    "text": "I love chia seed pudding but when the weather turns colder it is nice to have something warm to start off the day. If you are looking for a grain free breakfast then this porridge is a great easy option.\nChia seeds are best soaked and retain up to 8 times their normal weight in water. This means they are super hydrating for the body and packed full of omega 3 essential fatty acids which are anti inflammatory. They are great for any dry, flaky inflammatory skin conditions and help re hydrate the body so therefore the skin. What could be better than that! An instant morning pick me up.\nThe humble pear is often overlooked but they contain high levels of antioxidants and are a great source of vitamin c, copper and vitamin K. They also contain pectin which is a soluble fibre that binds to cholesterol and helps eliminate toxins from the body. Always leave the skin on your pears as the skin contains surprisingly high levels of phytonutrients including anti-cancer polyphenols, anti-aging flavanoids and the super antioxidant glutathione which can help prevent against cancer, stroke and high blood pressure.\nFeijoas are unique to NZ, Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina. Feijoas are part of the guava family, the skin is green and the fleshy pulp has a distinct tangy and aromatic taste which is also slightly sweet. If don\u2019t live somewhere that feijoas grow and haven\u2019t tried one, you truly are missing out. Get on over here! Feijoas grow in abundance in autumn in NZ and if you are lucky enough to have friends with feijoa trees (like we are) then generally a bagful or two will be dropped off on your doorstep. Feijoas are an excellent source of vitamin C, 100g of fresh fruit provides about 32.9mg of vitamin c which is 55 percent of the RDI. Feijoa contains small amounts of B-complex vitamins such as vitamin B3, B5 and B6, vitamin E and K, as well as minerals like calcium, magnesium, copper, and manganese.\nI have added chopped almonds on top give a bit of crunch and a extra bit of protein to help stabilise blood sugar to start the day. In addition the fruit and almonds are sauteed in cinnamon, cinnamon is superb at stabilising blood sugar. For those that may not think this is important, I can\u2019t tell you enough how many woman I used to see in clinic who experienced blood sugar imbalances which contributed to hormone problems, mood swings, fatigue, acne and so on. Starting the day off with a balanced breakfast is a must \u2013 yes we have all heard it before but it really is true for so many reasons. Give those hormones a helping hand ladies! And for those busy mums that feel like you are going to drop by the time the afternoon rolls around, a breakfast with healthy protein and fats is a must.\nTo make this breakfast, it is best to start the night before by soaking the chia seeds so that you can get the most of the nutrients from these nutrient dense seeds. The great thing is this process takes about 1 minute, then leave them overnight in the fridge and then wham you only have a couple of minutes of cooking to do in the morning. Easy peasy!\nA warm and nourishing porridge with chia, cinnamon pears and feijoas.\nStart the night before. Soak the chia seeds in the coconut and almond milk, stir the chia seeds and vanilla essence through the milk. Put in a covered bowel or sealed container or jar and leave in the fridge overnight.\nThe next morning prepare the rest of the dish: thinly slice the pear lengthwise leaving the skin on. Remove the skin from the feijoas and slice into small cubes.\nIn a medium skillet melt the coconut oil. Add the pear, feijoas, almonds and cinnamon to the skillet. Saute these for 3-5 minutes until the fruit is tender and the cinnamon is mixed through the fruit and almonds.\nWhile the pear, feijoas and almonds are sauteing gently reheat the chia seed porridge in a small saucepan, add the vanilla essence and stir through porridge, heat until warm but not boiling.\nSpoon the chia seed porridge into bowls and top with the pear, feijoas and almonds.\nReplace coconut milk and or almond milk with any of your favorite nut milk.",

    "text": "Based in Huntsville, Alabama, Redstone Federal Credit Union has been proudly serving the Tennessee Valley since 1951. With nearly 370,000 members and more than $3.5 billion in assets, Redstone is the largest credit union in Alabama and among the 25 largest credit unions in the nation.\nAlthough Redstone Federal Credit Union (RFCU) is a multi-billion dollar organization, the company runs with a lean marketing team. RFCU has 9 people in their marketing group with 1 person dedicated to email marketing. Prior to Marketo, RFCU was utilizing an outdated solution that required coding and heavy technical support to send emails. RFCU also had no way to capture interest of prospective members who were visiting their website. To grow their membership and increase their wallet share, RFCU wanted to shift from marketing in one-off campaigns to responding to existing and prospective members through triggered messaging when members became engaged with RFCU, such as a specific product page on the website.\nWith a small marketing department, RFCU needed a powerful solution to automate their marketing communications. The ability to create drip campaigns, to segment their audience, and stream communications with different paths were also important features in RFCU\u2019s search for the right solution. With automation, RFCU imagined creating a content strategy to engage both existing and future members. RFCU also wanted a way to keep track of their membership in order to determine when and where demand was high enough that future branches might be opened.\nRFCU identified and investigated several marketing automation solutions, and they chose Marketo. While RFCU recognized Marketo\u2019s thought leadership and appreciated the helpful and knowledgeable staff, their main reason for selecting was that it offered the most robust capabilities while also being easy to use.\nRFCU has leveraged Marketo to develop a strategy to drive awareness and capture website visitors with interesting content through both outbound campaigns as well as with landing pages on their website. In the first few months with Marketo, RFCU created two impactful campaigns. The first campaign was a cross-sell nurture campaign to inform members about RFCU\u2019s five great new checking account products. The second was a variety of landing pages offering advice-oriented content to support online advertising and capturing prospective member interest.\nWith Marketo, RFCU has been able to create a true content marketing strategy, something that was not possible before. In the first Marketo campaign which introduces members to the new checking accounts, RFCU\u2019s success was so overwhelming that the member/customer support team asked marketing to slow the pace of the campaign emails because they were receiving so many account conversions. The campaign hit 1/4 of the annual online goal for checking account conversions in just 7 weeks. As part of this campaign, RFCU sent a series of emails to 140,000 contacts, which resulted in 2,400 content downloads and created 5,500 new or upgraded accounts.\nGoing forward, RFCU is preparing to launch additional campaigns, including ones focused on mortgage products and a nurturing campaign for new members to introduce them to products through useful content in a weekly tips and insight format.",

Please stop by if you still need registration packets and information.\nSTEM Lab meets today in Learning Cottage #1 for Chess Club. Please check in with your lab teacher first before reporting to Ms. Webb.\nAll 7th and 8th grade band students are reminded about the in-school rehearsal today during 2nd block. Go to your 2nd block class before coming to the band room so that attendance can be taken, then meet Mrs. Pullen in the band room as soon as possible.\nThis week is Farm to School lunch week! Today\u2019s lunch is sourced from local farms and will be served by students from the agriculture classes. Today\u2019s entrees are BBQ chicken or Beef Bites. Did you know today\u2019s apples come from the Showalter orchard in Timberville? Rockingham County produces more agricultural products than any other county in Virginia. In 2012, we produced almost $700 million in products. You\u2019d have to go all the way to Lancaster, Pennsylvania to find another county that produces as much as we do!\nOctober is Standing Together month at Montevideo. Your counselors, in conjunction with your lab teachers, will be giving you opportunities throughout the month to express kindness, respect and generally looking out for one another. Notice as the former VIP Mustangs bulletin board outside the main gym changes to Acts of Random Kindness. Swing by and grab a tear-off slip of paper and do what it says to help spread some extra positivity. Also, it\u2019s always great to hear or tell something kind, so first thing in the morning, text something kind to a friend. Maybe let them know how much you appreciate them and their friendship. Maybe you could encourage them for the test they\u2019ll be taking later that day. Just take a few moments each morning the rest of the week and share some kindness. Keep looking for other ways to help make Montevideo an even better place.\nDue to the six grade field trip, there will be no lab choir today.",

If you buy a true portable building with only two skids it can be readily loaded onto a trailer for transporting to your new location.\nNone at all!! Since we do not use wood siding you will not have to paint or hire someone to paint your building nor will you have to repaint the building every few years. Since we install a heavy duty aluminum roof you will never have to replace shingles that blow off and deteriorate over time.\nNo!!! The reflective qualities of our 29 gauge steel roofing and light earth-toned colored steel siding will keep your building about 20 degrees cooler than a wooden building with the added advantage of being much less likely to catch on fire and burn down.\n30 Years or longer, easily twice as long as a building with wooden or other cheaper type of siding being sold to homeowners and businesses today.\nBecause as the owner I do the selling so I don't have to pay 15 to 20% commission to a salesman [and neither do you]. This means I can build you a better building that costs less, exceeds the features of other buildings, and still satisfies margin requirements for my business needs.\nTo keep costs down we do not inventory all the materials it takes to build the over 40 standard sizes we offer along with optional items. This means you get fresh materials straight from our suppliers.\nAgain to keep costs down! Credit card companies charge fees to businesses who accept their cards. These fees in turn are passed on to you the customer.\nThese fees in no way add to the materials or structure of your Steve Feemster Portable Building.\nAbsolutely! Our specifications and prices are superior to what you will find on the market today.\nWhat are some of the main differences between a Steve Feemster Portable Building and others?\nWe use 29 gauge steel roofing installed the correct way so that rain is channeled directly off the building.\nOur buildings don't leak. Period!\nWe use heavy duty 3/4 inch plywood instead of 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch particle board, wafer wood or other inferior products.\nWe build 8' walls on most of our buildings but we can cut them down lower if that's what you need.\nThese are just a few of the advantages you'll gain by owning a Steve Feemster Portable Building. Give us a call and we'll be glad to discuss your particular needs.",

If you\u2019re doing a Half Day option (drama, tennis or horseback riding), your morning will be spent focusing on that activity and you\u2019ll have 2 activities in the afternoon.\nHow do I pick my activities?\nWhen you arrive at camp, your cabin counselors will give you a list of 35+ exciting activities to choose from. You\u2019ll select your top 10 choices and the next morning you\u2019ll get your own unique schedule of 5 activities that you\u2019ll do each day for a week. Sneak a peak at all the activities available!\nWeekends at camp are awesome! On Saturday afternoon you have the chance to try out new activities and enjoy extra time at the pool with your new camp friends. After dinner, there\u2019s a movie night and on Sunday morning everyone gets to sleep in! Don\u2019t stay in bed too long though\u2013your new friends will be arriving soon and another awesome week at camp awaits!\nThere\u2019s no such thing as rain at camp \u2013 only liquid sunshine! Most activities can continue in the rain or will be relocated to a covered area nearby if there\u2019s a thunderstorm. Afternoon thunderstorms are a great time to challenge your counselors to a game of indoor GaGa ball, play a card game with cabin mates or finish that friendship bracelet you started!\nWhat if I can\u2019t swim or don\u2019t like swimming?\nNo big deal! Camp Friendship has over 35 activities, so there\u2019s plenty to do away from the water. We do have a daily free swim time at the lake or pool, but if you decide not to swim there\u2019s always beach volleyball, card games and friendship bracelets to make! Campers who do want to swim during the week will be asked to do a quick swim check when they arrive at camp. If our lifeguards think it would be safer for you to wear a lifejacket when you swim in the lake, we\u2019ll help you to pick one out so you can enjoy the zip line, rope swing, slide and high dive!\nSee for yourself with our virtual tour! All our cabins have bunk beds, electricity and screened windows. Cabins are not air-conditioned and do not have ceiling fans, but feel free to bring your own fan to stay cool! Junior Villages and Equestrian Village lodging have bathrooms inside, while Senior Village cabins have bath houses just a short distance away.\nCounselors are the fun-loving adults that take care of you when you\u2019re at camp. Counselors at Camp Friendship are kind, caring and interesting people that come from all over the world. They love teaching activities and having fun with you. They\u2019re always there to answer questions or help you with anything you need!\nWill I be the only new camper?\nNo! Every summer we have first time campers of all ages, so you definitely won\u2019t be the only camper who hasn\u2019t been to Camp Friendship before.\nMaking friends is what Camp Friendship is all about! You\u2019ll have the chance to make friends with your cabin mates, but you\u2019ll also meet so many new people in your different daily activities.\nWill I be the only American/International?\nNo! Every week, we have campers from all over the United States and all over the world join us here at camp.\nWhat if I want to come to camp with a friend?\nGreat \u2013 the more the merrier at Camp Friendship! If you\u2019re coming to camp with a friend, you can request to share the same cabin. Friends will likely do different activities throughout the day but will be together at the beginning and end of each day and during cabin time.\nCamp food is great, and there are always so many options to choose from during our buffet style meals! If you don\u2019t like scrambled eggs for breakfast, we have loads of choices including toast and cereal. If you don\u2019t like pizza, we have pasta and more! We have a full salad bar and sandwich bar available during lunch and dinner in case you want to build your own. All food is nut free and there\u2019s also a vegetarian, vegan and gluten free option at each meal. There\u2019s always plenty to eat at meal times, but don\u2019t forget to leave room for dessert!\nCamp days are long and busy, so we have Snack Bar time every afternoon to make sure you have enough energy to do your activities! Every morning at breakfast, you can select a drink and snack to have in the afternoon. If you\u2019re hungry in between activities, the Dining Hall is always open for you to grab some fresh fruit or cereal before heading to your next activity.\nNot a problem! As long as we know about your specific allergies beforehand, our kitchen staff are always more than happy to help.\nCan I bring my phone/tablet/iPad/Kindle/Nintendo DS, etc?\nNope! Camp Friendship is technology-free, and we love it that way. Trust us, you won\u2019t even miss it when you\u2019re here!\nWear comfortable clothes that are okay to get messy! We\u2019ve created a handy packing list to make sure you have everything you need when you\u2019re at camp!\nOur Camp Store is a great back up if you\u2019ve forgotten something! We sell water bottles, bug spray, toothpaste and CF-branded clothing to remember us by. If you need something to be mailed to you, just tell your counselor and they can coordinate it with the Village Supervisor.\nRead our blog on why it\u2019s awesome to get a ton of fresh air and go technology free for a week at Camp!\nThis is my favorite place on Earth!",

    "text": "Background The distribution of cigarette prices has rarely been studied and compared under different tax structures. Descriptive evidence on price distributions by countries can shed light on opportunities for tax avoidance and brand switching under different tobacco tax structures, which could impact the effectiveness of increased taxation in reducing smoking.\nObjective This paper aims to describe the distribution of cigarette prices by countries and to compare these distributions based on the tobacco tax structure in these countries.\nMethods We employed data for 16 countries taken from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project to construct survey-derived cigarette prices for each country. Self-reported prices were weighted by cigarette consumption and described using a comprehensive set of statistics. We then compared these statistics for cigarette prices under different tax structures. In particular, countries of similar income levels and countries that impose similar total excise taxes using different tax structures were paired and compared in mean and variance using a two-sample comparison test.\nFindings Our investigation illustrates that, compared with specific uniform taxation, other tax structures, such as ad valorem uniform taxation, mixed (a tax system using ad valorem and specific taxes) uniform taxation, and tiered tax structures of specific, ad valorem and mixed taxation tend to have price distributions with greater variability. Countries that rely heavily on ad valorem and tiered taxes also tend to have greater price variability around the median. Among mixed taxation systems, countries that rely more heavily on the ad valorem component tend to have greater price variability than countries that rely more heavily on the specific component. In countries with tiered tax systems, cigarette prices are skewed more towards lower prices than are prices under uniform tax systems. The analyses presented here demonstrate that more opportunities exist for tax avoidance and brand switching when the tax structure departs from a uniform specific tax.\nSignificant increases in cigarette excise taxes have been shown to be the most effective policy for reducing smoking.1 Tobacco excise taxes can be levied in two forms: specific and ad valorem taxes. A specific excise tax is a monetary tax levied based on the quantity of tobacco products (eg, per pack or by weight). While an ad valorem excise tax is a tax levied as a percentage of the value of tobacco products (eg, manufacturer's price or retail price).2 Although most governments impose certain excise taxes on cigarettes, the structure of these taxes varies markedly by countries. For instance, while many high-income countries (HICs) rely solely on specific excise taxes on cigarettes, European Union (EU) countries are required by the Council of the EU to impose excise taxes consisting of specific and ad valorem components, with a minimum floor. In addition, individual EU countries decide on the share of each component in total taxes under rules stating that the specific component must be between 5% and 76.5% of the total tax share of the weighted average price of cigarettes.2 ,3 As a result, individual EU countries rely differently on the specific and ad valorem components of their total cigarette excise tax.\nDespite these various excise tax systems, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how cigarette prices, through which taxation ultimately impacts smoking, are distributed in different systems. In particular, for LMICs where smoking is prevalent, the importance of tax structure as a factor mediating the effectiveness of tobacco taxation in controlling tobacco use has rarely been studied or discussed. For example, recent studies from China suggest that cigarette demand is relatively unresponsive to price, which might be a result of China\u2019s complicated tiered tax structure that results in very low prices for some brands.5 ,6 Therefore, it is important to understand how cigarette prices are associated with tax structures in order to maximise the impact of tobacco taxation on tobacco use.\nFrom an economic perspective, given that the cigarette market is usually dominated by a small number of companies in most countries, cigarette price distributions may largely depend on taxation systems. Economic models have implied that, compared with specific excises, ad valorem excises tend to lead to lower prices and may encourage trading down, for example, the purchase of cheaper cigarettes.2 This is because an ad valorem tax structure creates incentives for manufacturers to produce low quality, low price cigarettes. In contrast, specific excises, in the form of taxes or a tax floor, tend to lead to higher prices, in that producers have incentives to raise prices when they can claim all the increased revenue (which is not the case for ad valorem excises). In addition, specific excises would reduce consumers\u2019 incentives to switch down when taxes increase by raising the relative price of lower-price to higher-price brands. In their examination of cigarette prices in 21 EU countries, Chaloupka et al7 find that the price gap between premium and low-priced brands is smaller in countries with a greater specific component to excise taxes. However, that study is based on empirical evidence from EU countries that all use mixed taxation systems with different shares of specific and ad valorem taxes and, as a result, cannot directly compare pure specific, pure ad valorem and mixed systems, or tiered and uniform systems. Moreover, the price gap in that study is based on prices collected by the Economists Intelligence Unit for one leading international brand and one leading local brand, thus not reflecting the full distribution of cigarette prices in the market. Meanwhile, other than the aforementioned reasons, if the relative price of lower-priced brands relative to higher-priced brands increases, the market share of low-priced brands will likely fall. Therefore, compared with ad valorem excises, specific excises might lead to even higher prices with less price variability. The empirical evidence on the former hypothesis is shown in studies using data from HICs with purely specific tax systems. Nargis et al8 used four waves of data from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Surveys in Canada and the USA to examine the association between brand choice and relative prices and found that an increase in the relative price of lower-priced to higher-priced brands is associated with a decrease in purchasing of lower-priced brands in both countries. Sobel and Garrett9 also found that increases in the specific taxes in the USA lead to a lower market share for lower-priced generic brands.\nSeveral factors other than tax structures, such as tax avoidance and tax evasion, are likely to shape the cigarette price distribution as well. In some countries, taxes on tobacco are levied differently across jurisdictions such as states, provinces and Indian reservations. Therefore, cross-national-border and cross-jurisdiction-border shopping is one way to avoid taxes. For instance, in Canada and the USA, some excise taxes are exempted in aboriginal reserves and Native American reservations.1 In a recent paper Merriman17 assessed the extent of avoidance/evasion by collecting littered cigarette packs around Chicago, and found that three-fourths of the packs collected in Chicago did not bear the Chicago tax stamp. Using data from 15 ITC countries, Guindon et al18 found that more than 10% of smokers report engaging in tax avoidance or tax evasion in Canada, the UK and Malaysia.\nTax evasion, such as large-scale smuggling, could also contribute to an increase in the share of low-priced cigarettes. Although there is insufficient evidence that large-scale smuggling lowers average retail prices, some research has indicated that illicit trade could burden low-income countries disproportionately, where illicit cigarettes constitute 16.8% of the market compared with 9.8% of the market in HICs.19 The cigarette prices that we examine in this paper are survey-derived prices that reflect the combined effects of tax structures, tax avoidance and tax evasion. Although it is impossible in this study to disentangle the contribution of each to the distribution of cigarette prices, we hypothesise that the tax structure plays the most important role in cross-country differences in the price distribution. Moreover, unlike tax evasion and tax avoidance by switching to cheaper cigarettes, which may have a greater effect on prices at the lower end, differences in tax structures would have an effect in shifting the overall distribution of cigarette prices.\nIn summary, a greater price gap among brands could reduce the effectiveness of taxation in reducing tobacco use by increasing opportunities for substitution to cheaper brands as taxes rise. Among many tax structures, the uniform specific tax structure simplifies the taxation system and has advantages in raising the average prices and the relative price of lower-priced to higher-priced cigarettes. As a result, a uniform tax structure can increase the effectiveness of tax increases in reducing smoking.1 Therefore, analysing the price distribution using survey-derived data will add to the empirical evidence on how price distributions and gaps differ under alternative tax structures. Tax structures that lead to higher average prices and smaller price gaps can lead to a more effective tax system for reducing smoking. In this paper, we use data taken from 16 countries of the ITC Project, which cover many types of tax structures, to describe and compare cigarette price distributions across different tax structures.\nCigarette prices were derived for each country using the most recent data from the ITC Project Surveys.ii The ITC Project consists of parallel longitudinal surveys of smokers and other tobacco users (and non-users in most countries) conducted in 22 countries inhabited by more than 50% of the world\u2019s population, 60% of the world\u2019s smokers and 70% of the world\u2019s tobacco users. The ITC Surveys are designed to evaluate the policies of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.20 For the analyses reported in this paper, we selected ITC countries where cigarette purchase information was collected from smokers. The price per pack of 20 cigarettes was thereafter derived from the money spent in the last purchase and the number of cigarettes that were bought.iii In order to compare prices and their distributions across countries, we converted the derived prices in local currencies into constant 2010 international dollars using the purchasing-power parity and consumer price index of the country. Purchasing-power parity conversion factors and the consumer price index for each country were obtained from the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook database. In order to reflect the market share of cigarettes at different price levels, we use consumption weights to obtain aggregated measures of cigarette prices. Namely, for each individual smoker, we calculate how many cigarettes they smoke per day and construct a consumption weight as the ratio of his or her own consumption to the total consumption of respondents to the survey. These consumption weights are applied to cigarette prices when reporting mean, median and quartile prices.\nSurvey-derived prices are likely to better reflect the price distribution in the market than are other sources of prices, especially when we are interested in comparing the price distribution under different tax systems.21 These comparisons shed some light on the association between tax structure and price distribution, and resulting opportunities for tax avoidance under different structures. As discussed above, the tax structure could be exclusively specific, ad valorem, or a mixture of the two. Alternatively, taxes can also be levied uniformly or by tiers. Economic reasoning implies that tax structures with tiers or that rely more heavily on ad valorem excises will yield more opportunities for tax avoidance and branch switching. In the ITC Project sample of countries, a majority rely on uniform taxes, with only Brazil, Republic of Korea, China and Bangladesh applying tiered taxes. Most non-EU HICs including the USA, Canada, Australia and Republic of Korea, and some LMICs including Brazil, Uruguay and Mauritius solely rely on specific excises. In contrast, Bangladesh and Thailand rely on purely ad valorem excises; and China, Malaysia and EU countries apply mixed systems of specific and ad valorem excises, while individual countries may largely rely on one of the components.\nThe analyses in this paper proceed as follows: In table 1, after ranking countries by tax structure, the percentage of the specific component among the total excise tax, and the amount of total excise taxes, we present comprehensive statistics for price distribution by countries. In particular, mean, median, SD and skewness of prices are reported to show how much prices are skewed towards lower prices under alternative tax structures. The first quartile, third quartile and IQR, which is measured by the difference between the first and third quartile, are also reported. In addition, we calculate and show the ratio of the IQR to the median, which shows price variability around the median price. Other important statistics such as the minimum price, maximum price, price range and the ratio of the price range to the mean are also shown in table 1. Also, in figure 1, we exhibit price distributions by countries using boxplot to visualise the statistics that are reported in table 1 and to present the price distribution and variability in one graph. In table 2 we show, by tax structure, countries where prices are skewed in different directions and those where prices are most heavily skewed (skewness statistics are greater than 1 or smaller than \u22121). Finally, in table 3 we select and pair countries that are close in income levels and in the amount of total excise tax but that employ different tax structures, in order to compare their mean and variance using a two-sample comparison test.\nBoxplot of cigarette price distributions by country. AU (Australia), CA (Canada), MU (Mauritius), US (the USA), UY (Uruguay), KR (Republic of Korea), BR (Brazil), NL (The Netherlands), MY (Malaysia), UK (the UK), DE (Germany), MX (Mexico), FR (France), RC (China), TH (Thailand) and BD (Bangladesh).\nIn table 1, we categorise countries by their tax structures and the percentage of specific taxes among total excise taxes; VATs are excluded. Among countries with a mixed uniform tax structure, The Netherlands has the largest share of the specific component while France has the smallest (range: 9.4\u201367.3%). Although China imposes a small specific excise, the system largely relies on the tiered ad valorem component. And in general, for countries that impose a similar amount of total excises, those with simpler tax structures tend to have higher average prices. For instance, Mauritius and Mexico impose total excises of $2.45 and $2.29, respectively, but the mean price for Mauritius which uses a uniform specific tax structure is $1.29 higher than Mexico where a mixed tax structure is used. Among EU countries, The Netherlands and France impose total excises of $3.37 and $3.80, respectively, while The Netherlands with a larger specific share has a mean price $0.49 higher than France, which has a larger ad valorem share. The skewness statistics show that in countries where tiered taxes are applied, prices are more likely positively skewed, indicating that there are fewer higher prices in the distribution. In contrast, most countries with a uniform tax structure have skewness statistics close to 0, suggesting prices are relatively symmetric. When comparing Malaysia and Mexico, where a mixed structure is applied in both cases but Malaysia has a larger share of the specific tax component, more prices in Mexico are lower while more prices in Malaysia are higher.\nThe ratio of the IQR to the median reported in table 1 shows how prices deviate around the median. In countries with a purely ad valorem tax system, such as Bangladesh and Thailand, and China, which largely employs ad valorem taxation, this ratio is as high as 0.51\u20130.89, which suggests greater price variability around median prices. On the other hand, other than Uruguay, the USA and Canada where cross-jurisdiction shopping opportunities are relatively available, countries with mixed and specific uniform structures tend to have prices that vary less around the median, with ratios less than 0.25. When looking into the price range measured by the distance between the maximum and minimum prices, there is no clear pattern by different structures. However, if we compare how great the range is in contrast to the mean, the results indicate that the range is six to nine times as large as the mean in Bangladesh, China and Brazil, where taxes are levied by tiers, while other countries have ratios in the range of 1\u20134. In addition, China has a price range of $17.6, which is extremely wide compared with its average price.\nTable 2 summarises countries by comparing mean and median prices, as well as the skewness of prices. In the upper panel, we report countries where the mean price is higher than the median and those where the price mean is lower than the median, respectively. In contrast to the median, a higher mean suggests a positively-skewed price distribution that prices concentrate at lower values; and a lower mean suggests the opposite. These measures show that among the seven countries with the purely specific tax structure, four countries have mean prices larger than the median and three have mean prices smaller than the median. However, the mean and median prices are very close in magnitude for most countries with a specific tax structure. The skewness statistics reported in the lower panel show that prices are largely skewed to lower values in China, Brazil, Mexico, Bangladesh and Republic of Korea, where either tiered or ad valorem taxes (ad valorem component in mixed structures) are applied. This finding suggests that tiered and ad valorem taxes may distort cigarette prices towards lower values, increasing opportunities for switching to cheaper cigarettes as tax increases. In addition, prices are heavily skewed to lower values in the USA, which might reflect tax avoidance by cross-jurisdiction shopping.\nFinally, we select and pair countries that are close in the amount of total excise taxes but that use different tax structures, to compare their mean and variance using a two-sample comparison test. The selected country pairs are as follows: for LMICs, Uruguay (specific uniform) and Brazil (specific tiered) are paired to compare uniform and tiered tax structures; Mauritius (specific uniform) and Mexico (mixed uniform) are paired to compare specific and mixed structures; Malaysia and Thailand are paired to compare mixed and ad valorem uniform structures; and Malaysia and Mexico are paired to compare mixed structures with different shares of specific components. For HICs, Australia and the UK/France are paired to compare specific and mixed uniform structures. In addition, The Netherlands and France/Germany are paired to compare mixed systems dominated by specific and ad valorem components, respectively. The hypotheses that more complicated tax structures tend to have a higher price mean and present a smaller price variance are tested, with the rejection of these hypotheses suggesting the opposite. The results of the two-sample mean and SD (variance) comparison tests are shown in table 3.\nAlthough the mean comparison tests do not reject the hypothesis for one set of paired countries (Australia vs the UK), the remainder do. The rejection of this hypothesis for a majority of the comparisons indicates that countries where tax systems are simpler tend to have higher average prices than countries that impose similar total excise amounts but that have more complicated tax systems. The two-sample SD comparison tests of prices within each development group (HICs vs LMICs) yield similar results: cigarette prices show greater variability in countries where tax structures are more complicated. For example, the specific tiered system of Brazil has a higher SD than the specific uniform system of Uruguay. In particular, when comparing within the uniform tax structure, the mixed system of Mexico has a higher SD than the specific system of Mauritius, and the same conclusion holds for the SD comparison between Australia and the UK. Although the SD comparison of Australia and France suggests the SDs of the two countries are about the same, Australia has a much higher mean price than France. The mixed system of Malaysia has a higher price SD than the pure ad valorem system of Thailand, which suggests that mixed system in LMICs may not be superior to a pure ad valorem system in lowering price variability. The mixed system of France, which relies heavily on the ad valorem component, has a higher SD than The Netherlands, which relies heavily on the specific component. The same conclusions are found when comparing The Netherlands with Germany and Malaysia with Mexico. In sum, more complicated taxation systems tend to have greater price variability, and therefore are likely to provide more opportunities for tax avoidance by brand switching.\nIn this paper, we employed data for 16 countries taken from the ITC Project to construct survey-derived cigarette prices for each country. These self-reported prices were weighted by cigarette consumption and described using a comprehensive set of statistics. We further compared these statistics for cigarette prices under different tax structures. In particular, countries that are close in the amount of total excise taxes but that impose different tax structures were paired and compared in mean and variance using a two-sample comparison test.\nThere are a few limitations to these analyses. First, we presented direct evidence of price distribution in countries where different taxation systems are imposed. However, we did not estimate or analyse the associations between the type of tax structure and measures of the price distribution. Therefore, we cannot conduct a formal test of these associations. In addition, tax structures were grouped using two characteristics: the component of specific and ad valorem excise taxes, and if tiered rates are levied. As a result, it is difficult to disentangle the extent to which tiered and ad valorem tax structures distort the price distribution. Finally, we did not explicitly control for various forms of tax avoidance or evasion, such as cross-border shopping. Further research using times series data from many countries with different and changing tax structures is needed to address these limitations.\nOur investigation illustrates that, compared with uniform specific taxation, other uniform tax structures (ad valorem uniform and mixed uniform structures) tend to have price distributions with greater variability. Also, compared with uniform taxation, tiered tax structures tend to have price distributions with greater variability. Countries that rely heavily on ad valorem and tiered taxes generally have greater variability in prices around the median. Among mixed taxation systems, countries that rely more heavily on the ad valorem component tend to have greater variability in prices than countries that rely more heavily on the specific component. Among different tax structures that impose similar total excise taxes, simpler structures tend to have higher price means. In countries with tiered tax systems, cigarette prices are more skewed to lower prices than prices under uniform systems.\nThe analyses presented here demonstrate that when the tax structure departs from uniform specific taxes, more opportunities exist for tax avoidance by switching down to cheaper brands. These results also provide a potential explanation for why smokers in countries with a complicated tax structure, such as China, are often found to be relatively unresponsive to cigarette prices. In light of our findings, countries that solely rely on ad valorem excises would see tax increases have a greater impact on tobacco use if they were to switch to a pure specific taxation system. Similarly, for countries with a mixed taxation system such as Mexico, Malaysia and EU countries, increasing the share of the specific component or switch to a pure specific taxation system would enhance the effectiveness of the tax in reducing tobacco use. Finally, our findings indicate that tax structures have a substantial impact on price variability in cigarette markets, thus likely impacting smoking behaviours, including prevalence, consumption and cessation. Future research should explore how tax structures affect these smoking behaviours.\nEconomic models have suggested that a simple taxation system that applies a uniform specific excise tax has advantages in raising average cigarette prices, reducing tax avoidance and switching down, and discouraging manufacturer's incentives for pricing strategies that lower market prices. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence on how prices are distributed under different tax structures.\nIn this paper, we present and compare price distributions under alternative tax structures. We find that, compared with a uniform specific tax structure, tiered structures and other uniform tax structures tend to have price distributions with greater variability.\nAmong mixed taxation systems, countries that rely more heavily on the ad valorem component of the total tax tend to have greater price variability than countries that rely more heavily on the specific component.\nIn countries with tiered tax systems, cigarette prices are skewed more towards lower prices than are prices under uniform tax systems.\nWe would like to thank Anne Chiew Kin Quah for her valuable comments and support.\nIARC.

    "text": "Regardless of which military trade show I attend or what military application is being discussed at a show, the common trend is that everything is getting smaller, whether it\u2019s GPS systems, avionics computers, unmanned aircraft system (UAV) payloads, etc. This trend bodes well for suppliers to the military of small-form-factor standards such as PC/104, COM Express, or SMARC.\nThe applications that demand these standards are also getting the most important type of attention from the U.S. government, as the president\u2019s fiscal year (FY) 2017 budget request for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) shows. Increased funding for radar, electronic warfare (EW), and communications programs promise growth for defense electronics suppliers.\nThe total FY 2017 budget request is $582.7 billion, up $2.4 billion from the $580.3 billion enacted in FY 2016. The overall Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation (RDT&E) budget for FY 2017 is $71.765 billion, an increase over the FY 2016 enacted total of $69.968 billion. Funding dropped slightly, however, for the DoD\u2019s Science and Technology program, from $13 billion in FY 2016 to $12.5 billion for FY 2017.\nDesigners of embedded computing, signal processing, open architectures, and other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions should find a steady market as the DoD\u2019s missions continue to rely more and more on cyber interventions; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR); radar; and EW systems to keep an edge both on battlefields and during peacetime. Each application has an insatiable need for bandwidth and processing capability that is only fueled by embedded computing and open architecture designs. Below are key areas within the DoD budget that leverage embedded hardware and software.\nCyber operations get a $900 million increase in the FY 2017 budget program, with a total of $6.7 billion requested. For more on the DoD\u2019s cyber strategy, visit http://bitly.com/1Usabu0.\nTotal EW funding in the FY 2017 RDT&E budget is $298 million, more than $100 million more than the FY 2016 enacted total of $184 million. The Navy gets most these funds, with $183 million requested for the service. The Army and Air Force are slated to receive $102.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively. Procurement for the Navy\u2019s AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite is down slightly from the FY 2016 enacted total of $296 million, to about $275 million.\nRDT&E funding for radar programs comes in at about $755 million for FY 2017, down about $5 million from the FY 2016 enacted total of $760 million. Key programs getting FY 2017 RDT&E funding include Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) at $144.3 million, Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) at $83.538 million, and Three Dimensional Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) at $49.5 million.\nRadar program procurement for the FY 2017 RDT&E request comes in at about $560 million, a slight decrease over the FY 2016 enacted total of $568 million. Counterfire radars for the Army top the radar procurement request at $314 million, an increase of more than $100 million over the FY 2016 enacted total of $198 million.\nThe M1A2 Abrams battle tank has been modernized with a series of upgrades to improve its capabilities. Total FY 2017 funding \u2013 procurement, research, and development \u2013 in FY 2017 rises from $509 million in FY 2016 to $559 million.\nThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) consists of three variants: the F-35A Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL), the F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL), and the F-35C Carrier variant (CV). Total funding \u2013 procurement, research, and development \u2013 drops from $11.602 billion in FY 2016 to $10.504 billion in FY 2017.\nTotal funding for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) in the FY 2017 budget rises from $1.816 billion in FY 2016 to $1.599 billion.\nAll these numbers indicate a healthy demand for small form factor, embedded computing technology for military systems. However, uncertainty still reigns. As of this writing, the presidential election remains undecided. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the front-runners for the Democrat and Republican primaries, respectively. As democratic presidents are traditionally not as pro-defense spending as Republicans and Trump is an unknown, future DoD budget increases remain hard to predict.\nIf you would like a distraction from the crazy election atmosphere, read the budget documents in full at http://comptroller.defense.gov/BudgetMaterials.aspx. By the time you\u2019re done reading, we may have a new president.",

No variation of these Terms will be accepted unless agreed in writing by an authorised person of Alliance UK. We will not accept the inclusion of any alternative terms by a Customer which conflict with, alter or add to these Terms.\n3.6 Payment in advance for Orders to be delivered in the UK mainland may be made by cash, cheque, Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express. All Orders for Goods to be delivered to the Republic of Ireland must be paid in advance by Mastercard or Visa only.\n5.2 In the event that you need to return Goods, then a Goods Returns Authorisation Number (RAN) must be obtained from us for each and every return so that we are able to administratively process your return, otherwise we have no means of identifying the Goods being returned and this may result in difficulties in returning monies. You will be sent a RAN acknowledgement by email which will also include a downloadable returns label that should be printed off and secured onto the exterior of the package. The RAN must be clearly shown on each parcel returned, and must be in the original manufacturer's packaging (which shall not be defaced) complete with accessories, manuals and documentation. Except in the case of faulty Goods, returned items not complying with these requirements will be rejected.\nIf you need to return Goods to us for whatever reason, then please send such items to: Alliance UK Returns, 8 Camberwell Trading Estate, 117-119 Denmark Road, London, SE5 9LB.\n(d) On receipt by us of the returned Defective Goods, if following the testing process the Defective Goods are found to be in good working order without defect, we will return the Goods to you, and the carriage costs of this return will be your responsibility. Please note that if you have, in the meantime, required us to provide you with replacement Goods before completion of the testing process, you will be liable to pay for these Goods. If, when we examine the Defective Goods, it is evident that the defect has arisen because you have failed to follow Alliance UKor the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as to the storage, installation, commissioning, use or maintenance of the Goods, or if you have altered the Goods without the written consent of Alliance UK then we reserve the right to refuse a repair, replacement or refund.\n(e) You should note that we adhere to individual manufacturers\u2019 guidelines in respect of acceptable deviation of quality of certain items. Therefore, we reserve the right not to accept Goods considered by you to be defective if the error or fault is within the manufacturer\u2019s accepted manufacturing tolerances. If you have any doubt, please contact our Customer Services. As an example, due to the current manufacturing methods of active matrix display panels, a small percentage of sub-pixel anomalies are accepted by the industry as unavoidable.\n9.2 Website Security Alliance UK website employs the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption standard in all secure areas, including login pages, customer information and payment details. Provided that you are using an SSL-compliant browser such as Netscape's Navigator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Opera or Firefox, you will be able to conduct encrypted transactions without fear of an intermediary obtaining your credit card information.\n9.3 Data Protection & Data Security Data is maintained under the provisions of the Data Protection Act (1998), Alliance UK registration number. We may contact you from time to time to verify and update the data Alliance UK holds on your records.\n9.6 Alliance UK may share your information with any member of our group, which means our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985.\n9.7 Alliance UK may share your information with selected third parties outside the Systemax group, in order that they may contact you to let you know about goods or services which may be of interest to you. Please contact us if you wish to opt out of receiving such information.\n11.8 If you have any complaints with the Goods or Services provided by us please contact Customer Services by post or hand delivery addressed to Customer Services at Alliance UK, 8 Camberwell Trading Estate, 117-119 Denmark Road, Camberwell, London SE5 9LB or by fax to 020 7062 0661 or by e-mail to complaints@AllianceUK.com.\n11.9 Contact information for Alliance UK Limited is 8 Camberwell Trading Estate, 117-119 Denmark Road, Camberwell, London SE5 9LB.\n11.10 The registered office for Alliance UK Limited is 8 Camberwell Trading Estate, 117-119 Denmark Road, Camberwell, London SE5 9LB.

    "text": "John L. Hilton is adjunct professor of statistics at Brigham Young University. This chapter is reprinted by permission, with slight alteration for clarification. First published in BYU Studies 30/3 (1990): 89\u2014108.\nIn 1980 Wayne A. Larsen, Alvin C. Rencher, and Tim Layton published the first complete analysis of the Book of Mormon using the then adolescent tool of computerized stylometry, or wordprinting.1 They analyzed author-specific word-use rate to show that the purported authors in the Book of Mormon are statistically different\u2014that not one but many authors contributed to the book. Since then the science of wordprinting has continued to undergo considerable critical evaluation, particularly in its application to the Book of Mormon.\nShortly after BYU Studies published Larsen, Rencher, and Layton\u2019s pioneering work, I joined forces with a small group of scientists in Berkeley, California, who were attempting to verify the accuracy of wordprinting in general and to check the Larsen-Rencher-Layton results specifically. After seven years of study and development, we concluded that wordprint measurements are now at the stage where scholars can use such tests confidently and without personal bias to analyze contested authorship in many literary works, including the Book of Mormon. This paper explores our conclusion by (1) discussing some general ideas about wordprints and wordprinting, (2) reviewing some early wordprint studies in the evolution of wordprint science, (3) summarizing the development of a new measurement technique, including important control studies to verify the objectivity of that technique, and (4) setting forth some verified Book of Mormon measurements. Before proceeding, I will establish the need for wordprints for the Book of Mormon and also discuss one important caveat.\nThe need for rigorous, legitimate wordprint measurements is obvious in attempting to settle some of the most prominent controversies surrounding the Book of Mormon: Are the word patterns of Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, or Solomon Spaulding measurable in the Book of Mormon? Can wordprinting show that different sections of the Book of Mormon were written by different authors? Does Joseph Smith\u2019s role as translator obfuscate patterns unique to ancient authors? Fortunately the Book of Mormon is a near-ideal document for such objective wordprint studies, provided the measurement is made correctly.\nOf course, wordprint analysis, while it can measure certain facts objectively, cannot prove the holiness of the Book of Mormon. The understanding that the Book of Mormon has a divine origin is obtainable only by developing faith. Thus, while valid and objective wordprinting is no substitute for faith, wordprinting can, nevertheless, bolster the establishment of faith by rigorously demonstrating factual information about the book.\nWordprinting is a developing science, notwithstanding that the first written suggestions that something like wordprinting might be useful in objectively identifying authors appeared at least as early as 1851. Yet, because of the complexity of the measurements, the first credible studies had to await the availability of modern computers with their precise counting accuracy and high-speed computation. Therefore, wordprinting has undergone almost all of its significant development during the last thirty years.\nMost modern wordprint techniques measure only the placement of \u201cnoncontextual\u201d words. Noncontextual words like the, and, a, of, etc. are often capable of being interchanged or even dropped without a loss of overall meaning; they seem to add little in context information, often being consciously ignored by writer and reader alike. Obviously, measuring noncontextual words makes word-printing less sensitive to the subject matter. In addition, the technique improves statistical accuracy. Noncontextual words typically make up 20% to 45% of the total text, thereby providing a high number of statistical \u201cevents,\u201d and the larger the statistical measurement is, the more reliable the results are. Wordprint measurements made from large numbers of noncontextual words continue to show that an author\u2019s free-flow writings use these words in a habitual, nearly subconscious, unique way.4 However, if the author consciously imposes an external structure, the free flow of the author\u2019s wordprint pattern is modified, and accurate wordprint measurements become more difficult to obtain.\nWordprinting measures the difference in the way noncontextual word patterns occur in two compared texts. Usually one of the texts is of disputed authorship while the other is by an author suspected of writing the disputed text. If the same word pattern is found to be statistically different between the two texts, we identify the difference as a rejection.5 The total of the rejections measured when the two texts are tested for a large number of word patterns is identified as the number of rejections. The larger the number of rejections, the more likely the disputed text was not written by the author of the other compared text. Thus, testing a contested document against comparable texts from all possible candidate-authors will identify the most likely writer by eliminating authors whose texts generate high numbers of rejections.\nFinding the most likely writer depends on the word-printing technique\u2019s accuracy. The accuracy (and usefulness) of a wordprint measuring technique critically depends on the statistical reliability in detecting which of its tested text pairs are not written by the same author. Statistical reliability is rigorously demonstrated by using the technique with a large number of control-author texts for the purpose of verifying the authorship of known texts. These texts correspond in size and include examples of the different literary parameters (genre, subject matter, writing period, position in an author\u2019s career) that are to be studied later. The verifying measurements made between two control texts written by the same author are identified as within-author tests. The tests between texts written by different authors are called between-author tests. The statistical separation measured between the overall distributions of a large number of the within-author and between-author tests is the valid measurement of what will be expected when a contested author is later tested with the same technique. In other words, the difference between the number of rejections found between texts by the same author and texts by different authors will serve as a standard. This standard is used to evaluate the numbers of rejections found when testing texts of contested authorship.\nMeasuring the differences in word patterns between texts is the basic process of a wordprinting technique. Verifying such a technique, while straightforward in principle, is in practice very tedious. Thus, during the years of wordprinting development, many proposed wordprint measuring systems were verified only superficially on a narrow set of texts. Unfortunately, researchers often assumed that a wordprint measuring technique shown valid for one set of literary parameters would also be valid for all others. We now realize such assumptions are not valid; we must successfully verify each wordprint measuring methodology with control texts which represent all the literary parameters that are to be reliably measured later on.\nPerhaps one of the earliest successful wordprint studies in the United States was the classical work by the statisticians Frederick Mosteller and David L. Wallace, who published their work on author identification in 1964.6 While not the first scholars to attempt computer-assisted stylo-metry, they published one of the first complete and internally consistent studies on a set of historically important documents. Their work convincingly identified the author of several anonymously published Federalist Papers. Mosteller and Wallace measured the rates at which simple, noncontextual words were used per 1000 words of text. This statistical model appeared adequately sensitive and valid to unambiguously show that James Madison was the author of the disputed documents. They showed that the other two possible candidate-authors were overwhelmingly excluded as authors of any of the twelve disputed documents.\nThe wordprint study on the Federalist Papers had several advantages which facilitated statistical measurements. First, the documents are lengthy, were written in the same genre on the same subject, and have essentially the same vocabulary. Additionally, for control texts Mosteller and Wallace were able to use uncontested writings by the suspected authors, writings which are of the same length, genre, subject, and vocabulary as the suspect texts. That the simple Mosteller and Wallace wordprint technique had been shown to be valid only for their single, nearly ideal class of texts was at first not appreciated as important.\nNot all succeeding studies had documents that presented as favorable a situation as did that of Mosteller and Wallace. In addition, most later wordprinters did not execute their studies in such a thorough way. Many omitted any independent control studies to confirm that their wordprint techniques were valid for their given case. As a consequence, some published studies purportedly giving objective answers later proved to be inaccurate.\nThe first extensive wordprint measurements of the Book of Mormon appeared in 1978 when Alvin C. Rencher and Wayne A. Larsen began reporting their pioneering study in author identification. This work was followed by their complete report in 1980.9 They also coined the term wordprint, and introduced to Church and world scholars the interesting possibility of objective author identification in the Book of Mormon. They used information gained from earlier approaches and applied the simple noncontextual word-use rate of Mosteller and Wallace\u2019s technique but coupled it with a powerful, multivariate statistical analysis.\nUnlike previous studies which introduced the concept of hand-tabulated word measurements to the Book of Mormon,10 the 1980 wordprint study published by Larsen, Rencher, and Layton was widely recognized as important both within and without the Church.11 If the measurement technique was in fact objective and verifiable, any competent student could duplicate the calculations to determine answers to a number of questions that have remained controversial among Book of Mormon believers and detractors.\nAlong with others who found the reported work of the BYU team of Larsen-Rencher-Layton interesting and challenging was a small group of scientific researchers in northern California to which I belonged. Our group, later known as the Berkeley Group, included major contributors from different scientific disciplines and differing religious persuasions. All of us shared the scientific curiosity which led us to test the intriguing Larsen-Rencher-Layton claim. In the fall of 1980, we began our study. As the major LDS contributor in the group, I was little different from my agnostic and Jewish colleagues: each of us seriously questioned whether objective measurement could determine who did or did not write a controversial document like the Book of Mormon. Therefore, armed with a healthy skepticism, we began a confirmational study\u2014the kind of study scientists typically perform in the physical sciences\u2014to recalculate the wordprint measurements while correcting any procedural or calculational flaws which could potentially have confused the results of the original study.\nDuring the time our Berkeley Group was doing its work, other Book of Mormon scholars were also studying the approach proposed by the Larsen-Rencher-Layton team. One of the most notable of these is the University of Utah statistician, D. James Croft. His work is that of a competent scholar as well as a conscientious believer in the divinity of the Book of Mormon. His published work is a carefully reasoned critique of the Larsen-Rencher-Layton paper.14 As would be expected from a scholar of the exact sciences, he cautioned his LDS readers about the unverified nature of the methodology: \u201cClose scrutiny of the methodology of the BYU authorship study reveals several areas which seem vulnerable to criticism.\u201d After calling for a redevelopment of methodology which could circumvent the specific areas he found questionable, he concludes, \u201cCertainly any research done in the future will be indebted to Larsen, Rencher and Layton, who called our attention to an interesting and challenging area of Book of Mormon study. At the present time , however . . . it would be best to reserve judgment concerning whether or not it is possible to prove the existence of multiple authors of the Book of Mormon\u201d (21).\nWe kept in close contact with Dr. Croft and others15 who were contributing to the continuing refinement of wordprinting during the years when our independent methodology was under development. We appreciated the continuing contributions of these scholars as they helped us insure that the suspect areas recognized in the earlier methodologies would be avoided and that the verification of our new wordprint measuring technique would be complete enough to insure reliable answers.\nOur new conservative measurements incorporate six points which were not used in earlier Book of Mormon wordprint studies. These points contribute to improved reliability when 5000-word texts are tested. They are (1) measuring the author\u2019s wordprint by studying the use rate of sixty-five noncontextual word-pattern ratios as proposed by Morton (1985); (2) abandoning the commonly accepted statistical assumption of \u201cnormality\u201d of word distribution and instead using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric statistic, which does not require the unverifiable normality simplification; (3) developing a \u201cwrap-around\u201d word-group counting method which helps break apart clusters of similar words in the sampled text words (this method helps provide the statistically required word-group homogeneity); (4) making comparison measurements between just two texts at a time; (5) using the oldest extant Book of Mormon manuscripts (the texts used do not include the repetitive use of the phrase and it came to pass, nor do they include significant direct quotations from the King James Bible\u2014including such text would distort the noncontextual word counts for each author); and (6) verifying the sensitivity of the computer coding and measurement methodology by measuring a diverse set of texts of nondisputed authorship which represent the appropriate literary parameters.\nDeriving the model becomes relatively unimportant compared to designing the control studies which verify or disprove the validity of the method. For our control studies, we specifically chose a representative set of literary texts which would test the extremes found in English-language writings. When we tested these control texts, we found that our technique yielded well-defined, bell-shaped distributions, showing that our new wordprint technique is essentially insensitive to the textual changes introduced by the differing literary parameters of genre, subject matter, writing period, position in an author\u2019s career, or normal publication editing.\nSpecifically, this extended verification study tested the validity of our model by calculating 325 diverse wordprint tests. These tests studied 26 noncontroversial 5000-word texts which had been written under various conditions by nine different control authors (see Appendix 3). The within-author and between-author results rigorously supported the basic wordprint assumption: although all authors have many writing habits in common, they each show measurably unique, stable rates for some noncontextual word patterns. Among the nondisputed documents that were used in the testing were texts by Oliver Cowdery and samples of Joseph Smith\u2019s autographic and dictated writings.\nThe results of our verification tests are displayed in figure 1. Thirty-three of these tests are made by comparing texts written by the same author; 292 of the tests compared one author\u2019s writing against that of another author. The black bars represent the 33 within-author measurements, which yield a statistically smooth distribution peaking at about 2 rejections, a result that is theoretically expected.19 The distribution peak for between-author comparisons is about 7 rejections. Therefore, about two-thirds of the true between-author measurements fall above even the extremes of the within-author distribution. This result means that when any 5000-word disputed text is tested against a known author\u2019s comparable works and measures 7 or more rejections, the two texts are very likely not written by the same author.20 The lower the number of rejections, the greater the likelihood that the two texts were written by the same author; the higher the number of rejections, the more likely that different authors composed the two compared texts.\nIf we have only two 5000-word texts and their paired testing measures 1 to 6 rejections (as is expected for a true between-author pair in about one-third of the cases), we cannot assign authorship unambiguously because the within-author and between-author distributions overlap each other in this range. Similarly, for the few tests (about ten percent of the true within-author cases) that measure zero rejections, there is a high probability that the compared texts were written by the same author.\nWe wished to make the most conservative measurement possible; therefore we compared the two Book of Mormon authors who have the largest number of 5000-word texts. Further, even though our verification testing showed that our new wordprint measuring technique is not unduly sensitive to normal changes of genre, we still chose the more conservative comparison by testing only within the same literary form. Therefore, we selected for our critical Book of Mormon verification measurements three independent, 5000-word texts from the didactic writings of each of the two major purported Book of Mormon authors, Nephi and Alma. Those texts are the largest same-genre pair in the book. Besides eliminating any possible lingering concern that changing genre might artificially cause additional rejections, the use of the didactic genre has the advantage of essentially excluding the possibly troublesome phrase and it came to pass. This phrase is the only phrase used repetitively enough in the Book of Mormon to be troubling to wordprint measurements.\nOur results are displayed starting with figure 2, which shows the distribution of the number of wordprint rejections for the six possible within-author tests of Nephi against Nephi and Alma against Alma. The within-author tests for both show the same distribution as the within-author tests of our control studies, shown in grey in figure 2.\nFigure 3 is a plot of the rejection distribution calculated from the between-author tests of direct interest to the Book of Mormon authorship question. The black bars show the comparisons of the texts purportedly written by Nephi when tested against those purportedly written by Alma. The tests show the same relatively large number of rejections found in the between-author distribution in figure 1 (shown in figure 3 in grey), which was derived from the comparisons made between the texts of the different control authors.\nTable 1 shows the measurements for the individual wordprint tests used in producing figures 2 and 3. Taking the comparisons of Nephi versus Alma, we found that in eight of the nine tests, 5 or more rejections resulted. Four of these tests produced 7, 8, 9, and 10 rejections. These four high-rejection tests (which yielded 7, 8, 9, and 10 rejections) independently measure a statistical confidence of greater than 99.5%, 99.9%, 99.99%, and 99.997% probability that the measured rejections show that the author\u2019s patterns are very different consistent with Nephi\u2019s texts having been written by a different author than wrote Alma.21 Therefore the Book of Mormon measures patterns of different authors according to its own internal claims.\nBy using a new wordprint measuring methodology which has been verified, we show that it is statistically indefensible to propose Joseph Smith or Oliver Cowdery or Solomon Spaulding as the author of the 30,000 words from the Book of Mormon manuscript texts attributed to Nephi and Alma. Additionally these two Book of Mormon writers have wordprints unique to themselves and measure statistically independent from each other in the same fashion that other uncontested authors do. Therefore, the Book of Mormon measures multiauthored, with authorship consistent to its own internal claims. These results are obtained even though the writings of Nephi and Alma were \u201ctranslated\u201d by Joseph Smith. We also described control studies of modern language academic translations where, in practice, a single translator can consistently preserve the unique wordprints of the several original authors he has translated.\nUseful noncontextual word patterns meet the following conditions: they yield an unambiguous count, they occur frequently, they have common alternate expressions, their use rates tend to become habitual, and they are minimally affected by the period of the writer\u2019s career, the subject matter, and the genre. Therefore, useful word patterns are typically made up of key words such as common articles, conjunctions, and prepositions. Measurements are calculated from the ratio of the overall key-word-use rate against the same key-word-use rate in certain sentence positions, word collocations, proportional pairs, or the use of key words adjacent to certain parts of speech and novel vocabulary words.\n# represents the number of end of sentence markers fws represents the first word in a sentence lws represents the last word in a sentence 2nd lws represents the second to last word in a sentence fb means \u201cfollowed by\u201d pb means \u201cpreceded by\u201d x represents any word r+l means that the word to the right and left are unique within the original 1000-word block.\nThe photonegative of the 1966 filming of the Book of Mormon printer\u2019s manuscript was courteously supplied, without endorsement, by the History Commission of the RLDS Church. By October of 1982, a board of seven editors prepared a primitive Book of Mormon text using the following sources: (1) a computer file of the 1830 Palmyra first printed edition of the Book of Mormon developed in the BYU Language Research Center by L. K. Browning, (2) the photo-offset copy of the first edition printed by Wilford C. Wood, (3) a copy of the text of extant sections of the original dictation manuscript collected by L. K. Browning, and (4) the complete printer\u2019s manuscript. The editors prepared a composite file of the oldest sections from each manuscript to complete a Book of Mormon text computer file which we named \u201cThe Most Primitive Book of Mormon Manuscript Text.\u201d The editors also prepared and verified line headers which identified the apparent original author, the literary form, modern book, chapter, verse, and line notation for each line of text.

Jenkins, \u201cOn Maximizing Author Identification by Measuring 5000 Word Texts\u201d (Provo, Utah: FARMS, 1987).\n3. Works known to be written prior to computer-aided authorship are essentially immune. In principle one can argue that a modern, computer-assisted forger could manufacture a document capable of deceiving an authorship measurement. To attempt such a forgery would be an enormous task and would still leave the forger unsure beforehand as to which of all of the possible word patterns the wordprinter would ultimately use to test the manufactured document. Of course, such a fraudulent document would be susceptible to detection by the standard procedures now used to identify any pastiche.\n4. To be a valid measurement, the words must be essentially the free-flow choice of the purported author. Extensive quoting of someone else\u2019s words is different from free paraphrasing and, of course, tends to produce a wordprint closer to the pattern of the one being quoted. Further, deliberately writing to an externally imposed pattern which restricts the normal noncontextual word choices of the writer or repetitively using normally noncontextual words in textually important ways can also change the wordprint patterns. For an example of deliberate change in a wordprint, see Tim Hiatt and John Hilton, \u201cCan Authors Alter their Wordprints? Faulkner\u2019s Narrators in As I Lay Dying,\u201d Selected Papers from the Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Symposium, ed. Melvin Luthy (Provo, Utah: Deseret Language and Linguistic Society, 1990). Examples of these wordprint problems found in the Book of Mormon are the extensive quotations from the King James Bible and the repetitive use of the phrase and it came to pass. Proper wordprint testing must take these special problems into account.\n5. A rejection results from the statistical calculation of a null-hypothesis rejection (p<.05) for any one of the tested word patterns as the two texts are compared. A rejection is considered statistically useful only for word patterns that can be found five or more times in either of the compared 5000-word texts.\n6. For the 1964 study, see F. W. Mosteller and D. Wallace, Inference and Disputed Authorship: The Federalist Papers (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1964); second edition published as Frederick Mosteller and David L, Wallace, Applied Bayesian and Classical Inference: The Case of the Federalist Papers (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1984).\n7.

Some publications that support Larsen, Rencher, and Layton\u2019s work, besides those referenced in nn. 8 and 14, include New Era 9 (November 1979): 10\u20143, and Noel B.

In his presentation on authorship attribution in the literary computing session, Rudman noted their work as significant.\nAmong the anti-Book of Mormon references, likely the most extensive work provoked by the Larsen-Rencher-Layton study was an attempt at a wordprint measurement by Ernest H. Taves as reported in his book Trouble Enough: Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1984), 225\u201460. Unfortunately, the Taves study was fundamentally flawed as described in the critique of his work (John L. Hilton, \u201cReview of Ernest Tares\u2019 Book of Mormon Stylometry,\u201d [Provo, Utah: FARMS, 1986]), and therefore did nothing to add to or detract from their work.\n14. D.

Subsequent to our study of the works of two German authors, we extended our work to include three more semiclassical German novella authors, all of whom had been translated by the same German-to-English translator, Harry Steinbauer. All of our new measurements gave the same results as before: each German author\u2019s translated work was internally consistent but distinctly different from all other translated authors\u2019 measurements.\n18. Not all translators need show these differing patterns. Some translators think their nonliteral \u201cfree translation\u201d is preferable. Complete free translations could be expected to yield only the translator\u2019s personal paraphrase of the ideas from the original text. In the extreme, free translations would produce only a single wordprint pattern for all of the translator\u2019s personal writings and translations of different foreign authors\u2019 works.\n19. Typically between 40 to 47 of Morton\u2019s 65 word patterns are measured often enough to be accepted as statistically useful. We therefore expected that true within-author comparisons show an average rejections number at slightly over 5% (i.e., .05 x 40=2) as we compared the two texts, at alpha .05 or 95% probability. Our results confirmed our expectations.\n7 rejections (t=2.76) gives >99.5% confidence that the two texts are statistically different and therefore written by different authors.\n8 rejections (t=3.39) gives >99.9% confidence that the two texts are statistically different and therefore written by different authors.\n9 rejections (t=4.02) gives >99.99% confidence that the two texts are statistically different and therefore written by different authors.\n10 rejections (t=4.64) gives > 99.997% confidence that the two texts are statistically different and therefore written by different authors.\n21. Furthermore, because the data are categorical and in a statistical sense (approximately) independent, the probability is vanishingly small that Nephi and Alma could have had the same author in spite of all four texts measuring with high rejections. The combined probability would approach 1.3 x 10-14. (This calculation is simply the product of each of the four probabilities for same authorship\u2014one minus the probability for different authorship reported above\u2014which would be .005 x .001 x .0001 x .00003 = 1.3 x 10-14.) Approximate independence of the four paired-test texts is assumed, as is customary in wordprinting (see A. Q. Morton, 154\u20145, n. 7). This approximate simultaneous calculation shows an enormous statistical overkill, demonstrating overwhelming statistical separation between the didactic writings of the purported Book of Mormon authors Nephi and Alma.\n22. Care was taken to insure that the texts used to represent the free-flow writing of Oliver Cowdery, Solomon Spaulding, and Joseph Smith were correctly chosen for minimal editorial rework and that they were correctly entered into the computer. In the case of Joseph Smith two of the three 5000-word files were taken from his own autobiographic writings, the third from the earliest version of his dictated work used for Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:1\u201475. Solomon Spaulding was sampled from a certified transcript of his manuscript labeled \u201cManuscript Story.\u201d Oliver Cowdery is represented from bylined articles taken from numbers of the Kirtland, Ohio, newspaper Messenger and Advocate printed during the time he was the active editor.",

From Biggar we headed west along Highway 51 towards Kerrobert. We turned north onto Highway 659 and after about 6.5 km came to a grid road that would lead us to the confluence point. It was quite apparent that this one would once again be another typical Saskatchewan confluence point ... flat prairie and a farmer's field.\nOne and a half kilometers west then about 310 m north on a second grid road brought us to within 178 m west of the confluence. We parked the van on the side of the road and headed out on foot. We both remarked what a difference this field of wheat was in comparison to the one we had been in at N51\u00b0 W102\u00b0. There the wheat was at least waist high while here it barely came up to our knees. The ground was extremely dry and in several places we noticed deep cracks in the soil. This is not going to go down as a record crop year for farmers in the west side of the province. Once again the drought was taking its toll.\nAlthough the mosquitoes were not quite as bad as we had experienced at our previous visit to N52\u00b0 W108\u00b0 we did find that the field was alive with grasshoppers. If the drought wasn't bad enough for the farmers to contend with they also had the grasshoppers to deal with. They were managing to destroy what little crop there was.\nAfter taking the required photos we looked around the area to find something a little more interesting to photograph. We did find a pretty little valley just 800 m north and took a few pictures there. Too bad the confluence point wasn't situated there! It was now 6:00 and time to call it a day. We headed west, passing through Kerrobert where a couple of other photo opportunities presented themselves. Our plans called for an overnight stop in Lloydminster ... the only city in Canada that exists in two provinces. We had at least another 200 km to drive before we could call it a day. Supper was definitely going to be late tonight!\n#1: Looking north from the confluence point towards a small valley in the distance.\n#4: The van on the road west of the confluence.\n#5: The GPS showing \"the spot\".\n#7: Looking down the road to the valley mentioned in picture #1.\n#9: The Graduates of 2001 \"graffiti barn\" just outside of Kerrobert.",

I think i am using relispray everyday to come over my knee pain. I bought this car in 2016 , its running has been just 500 km up till now. When I called up the ford show room they said it's normal in the new car, after 1st servicing done , clutch will loosen up. I have no other choice then to wait and watch. however the kind of reviews i am reading it looks like this problem persist even after 1st servicing done after 2500 km. This is for sure that it does not suit their stature that these kinds of complaints are coming from customer. If you buy a dress which turns out to be defective it's replaceable but not cars where you spend approx 10 lakhs. Also we tend to use these cars for at least 5 to 7 years or even more. I truly dont know what i will do if clutch doesn't loosen up. I have taken a loan on this car, this is really gonna hit my budget if i have to sell this car because of the pain and buy a 2nd hand car. I have also decided to write an email to ford eco sport about this, and i think all those who are facing this problem should raise their voice after all we are customers and deserve to get quality product and a good after sale from ford.",

One of the older palaces in the city, its name means \"golden house\" due to the gilt and polychrome external decorations which once adorned its walls. The palace was built between 1428 and 1430 for the Contarini family, who provided Venice with eight Doges between 1043 and 1676.\nThe palace is a significant example of Venetian Gothic in the early 15th century.\nReservations can be made online for the period from 11:00 to 23: 00 o\u2019clock. Reservations can be made over the entire duration of the opening hours. Groups of 8 or more persons can be contacted at short notice via email or telephone.\n\u201eWie in Italien\u201c Tolles Personal, freundlich, zuvorkommend und das Essen wie im Urlaub! Und wichtig, keine \u00fcberzogenen Preise! Perfetto!\nTolles Lokal! Sehr leckeres italienisches Essen zu fairen Preisen. Wir waren an 2 Tagen dort essen und es war einfach fantastisch. Leckere Pasta und Pizza. Excellenter Wein und freundliche Bedienung. Tolles Ambiente. Absolut empfehlenswert.\nIch w\u00fcrde auch mehr Sterne geben wenn es ginge....Tolles Ambiente, super leckeres Essen und sehr freundliches Personal...wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder wenn wir in M\u00fcnchen sind.\nEin gelungener Abend! Wir sind der Empfehlung auf TripAdvisor gefolgt und k\u00f6nnen die sehr gute Bewertung nur best\u00e4tigen. Freundlicher netter Service auch ohne Reservierung. Leckeres Essen und ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis. Gleich auf die Favoriten-Liste gesetzt.\nBecome part of the story. In 1968, for the first time our uncle opened in Munich the first restaurant and a short time later a \u201cGelateria\u201d , as well as the legendary Pescatore in the \u201cSchwanthalerstra\u00dfe\u201d, the then in-meeting of the Munich high society and the place for before and after the \u201cDeutsches\u201d Theater. Over time, the Five Brothers united in Munich and thus began the legendary era of the Munich-Italians.\nCA`D`ORO opening, then impressively decorated with lots of wood and gold accents. At the beginning, only Italian specialties were served in the restaurant, pizza was not available at this time in the restaurant.\nModernization of the restaurant with a design reference to Venice.\nThe bistro in the front part of the restaurant has been removed. The result is a timely and stylish restaurant boutique with connection to the classical restaurant, which invites you to linger over a glass of wine or for a honest Italian meal. Honest. Modern. Tradition-conscious.",

Actually really not a good example. In the UK we decided to leave cars and alcohol alone, but come down hard on the combination. Drink driving was explicitly banned in the UK in 1967. By 1979 (first year of statistics) there were 1640 deaths on the road where one driver was drunk. Last year it was 200. And it's been down to a consistent 230-240 for the last six years.\"\nThe US has similar rules governing alcohol in combination with both cars and guns. The former were enacted during roughly the same period that you mention, albeit with less extreme results: We used to attribute roughly half of fatal auto accidents to alcohol, but by the time the total number of deaths peaked several years ago, it was down to a third.\nIt's complicated to estimate because US states use different definitions of intoxication, and reporting is inconsistent both geographically and over time.\nWhere I am, it's illegal to carry a pistol if you have any detectable alcohol in your blood. (The standard for driving is 0.08%.) It's also illegal to carry one in public without a permit.",

It\u2019s like them taking God out of Noah and replacing Him with rock monsters.\nIS THAT HOW THEY REMADE NOAH? NEER DID SEE THAT ONE!\nYeah, I never finished it. Only made it half an hour in. Have you heard about the new Moses movie, Exodus: Gods & Kings? I did a competitive review of that one recently, comparing it to The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt, and comparing all three to scripture. The new movie was the furthest from scripture. It stars Christian Bale (Batman in the Dark Knight trilogy) as Moses, and was directed Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner), so I\u2019m not too surprised.\nIs it on TV yet\u2026I may have seen MOSES\u2014they sue cut out a lot\u2026twisting things around (like Jethro telling MOSES to trust nobody\u2026.and pulled a knife on him\u2026for an example\u2026) No help, at all!\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019d be on TV yet. It just came out last year. But yeah, alot of modern adaptations of biblical stories take God out of the story to appeal to the atheist mainstream.\nTrying to deceive, if they can even the elect in Christ\u2026Matthew 24:24.\nlol I know, right! I\u2019m glad there are movies like War Room and God\u2019s Not Dead being released in the mainstream. It was awesome that War Room was #1 in America for three weeks in a row! It beat Mad Max!! That is awesome!!\nREAD THE BOOKS AND FORGET ABOUT THE SECOND SERIES REWRITE. IT\u2019S TOO SARCASTIC OF THE WHOLE IDEA.",

    "text": "Looking for a center console is exciting \u2013 but it can also be challenging due to the overwhelming variety of products and manufacturers out there. Testing the ride for yourself, determining elements that are important for your lifestyle, and researching product attributes and quality will go a long way in in your search for the best center console. To help break things down, we turned to Regulator Marine Sales Representative Tim Ford, who has over 35 years of experience with brands including Regulator Marine, Northstar Electronics, and Lee\u2019s Tackle.\nWhile it\u2019s not the first step in the process, it\u2019s arguable the most important. Contact your dealer and plan a sea trial. But don\u2019t go out on a gorgeous, calm day. Go for a ride on a day when sea conditions are a little rough \u2013 in fact, go out in every condition you think you\u2019ll encounter on your waterway. And make sure you test all center consoles in the same conditions! That\u2019s the only way to truly get a sense for what the boats can handle and the level of safety they can provide for you and whoever you have onboard. All boats ride nicely on beautiful days, but not all owners have the luxury of boating on beautiful days. You want a center console that will safely get you out, and bring you home, in any condition.\nThe importance of quality cannot be stressed enough. Do your research, visit the factory, and talk to the people who engineer, design, and build your boat. To help determine the level of quality behind the build, find out if the manufacturer is NMMA-certified. This is a baseline check that tells you if the boat has been tested against critical build and safety standards.\nLook at the fit & finish of the center console. Do all doors and compartments close perfectly, with ease? Are there any rough edges or is everything smooth to the touch? Find out if the tuna door was part of the initial hull design to create a seamless addition, or if it was cut out of the hull during the build, for example.\nIn the long run, owning a boat built by a manufacturer that places quality above all can make a world of difference. After using your boat in a variety of conditions \u2013 some more strenuous than others \u2013 you\u2019ll eventually need to fix something. Whether you do the work yourself or have it done professionally, ease of use is essential. Is everything readily accessible? Do you have access to your batteries, fuel filters, and wiring harnesses? Take time to look into all nooks and crannies! The quality of build will make a difference.\nDon\u2019t forget about customer service. If you have a question or need help replacing a part, you want a direct line to your manufacturer and build team. Find out about the manufacturer\u2019s Customer Service Index (CSI), a program designed to measure and improve customer service satisfaction. A good rating is unique to the best of the best! You should also take the warranty into account \u2013 what is it and how is it handled? On top of this, scheduling and taking a factory tour also gives insight into the manufacturer\u2019s dedication to quality and commitment to customer satisfaction \u2013 plus, it\u2019s a lot of fun!\nDown the line, when you\u2019re ready to sell your boat, you need to know that each detail was designed to last. Buying a boat is an investment, so having one with good resale value is key! Going online and comparing used center console values, as well as depreciation values, will give you a good idea of what to expect.\nDetermining what size boat is best for you and your lifestyle is one of the first things to think about. Two main factors that come into play are where you do your boating and who you plan to have on board. Do you want a deep vee hull, a stepped hull, or a flatter hull? Are you going offshore fishing, cruising in the bay, or a combination of both? Do you plan to have friends and family on board? These are all questions that will help when deciding between different center consoles.\nIf you\u2019re a serious angler, you\u2019ll need to consider what fishing amenities are available onboard. Does the boat have a good amount of rod holders and does it have outrigger capability? What is the fish and tackle storage capacity? Is there a livewell and is it separate from the fishbox? What\u2019s its capacity? Is there a big fish locker, and is it insulated? Is there fresh water on board?\nYou will also want to consider fuel capacity. Going offshore and fishing the canyons can often mean running over 100 miles offshore. Generally, the smaller the boat, the smaller the fuel tank, and the larger the boat, the larger the fuel tank. Traditionally, smaller boats might have a 50-60-gallon tank, whereas true offshore sportfishers that are 23 to 25 feet have a 150-gallon capacity, or more \u2013 meaning they have a range of over 300 miles. You also need to ask yourself, are the engines fuel-efficient for the boat size and range expected?\nOf course, power goes hand in hand with fuel efficiency. Outboard engines not only allow for easier maintenance and more overall cockpit space, they are great for handling both low and high speeds, all while being fuel efficient. That being said \u2013 you don\u2019t want your boat to be underpowered. When you\u2019re offshore in four-to-six-foot chop, the last thing you\u2019ll want is for your engines to work too hard. Today, engines are a lot more efficient than ever. Four-stroke engines are quieter, you don\u2019t have the oil mix, and you don\u2019t have to deal with the noise or smell! That\u2019s great when you\u2019re offshore fishing with buddies, but it\u2019s also a plus when you\u2019re entertaining on the water.\nIf you know you\u2019ll have your friends and family onboard, you\u2019ll need to make sure your boat is equipped with the necessary creature comforts and has enough deck space. Is there a head? Are there any entertainment electronics? How much seating is on board and does the boat have a table? Be sure to also check the coast guard rating for weight and capacity. These are all factors that may be more or less relevant, depending on how you plan to use your boat.\nOverall, it\u2019s a lot to think about. Sometimes, it helps to make a check list: what you have to have, what you want to have, and what you\u2019d like to have. From there, you can determine what size boat makes the most sense. Then, of course, it comes down to the learning more about the manufacturer and testing the ride for yourself.\nHappy shopping and see you offshore!",

    "text": "The immune system has the important role of keeping the body in top shape against foreign invaders. But what happens when the defense system is compromised?\nAccording to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, more than 80 diseases develop when the immune system attacks the body's organs, tissues and cells. Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease are some of the more common autoimmune diseases and disorders.\nAccording to what Rev. Malkmus shared in his book \"The Hallelujah Diet: Experience the Optimal Health You Were Meant to Have,\" the immune system produces proteins \u2013 also known as antibodies \u2013 that attack germs. It also produces T lymphocytes, special blood cells that recognize foreign tissues and put up a defense wall so they can't harm the body. When the immune system is running as it should, it can properly distinguish the normal tissues from the unfamiliar ones, and get rid of the latter. Unfortunately, when someone is living with an autoimmune disorder, the immune system can't tell between the two, and therefore, it malfunctions.\nDon't turn to doctors for medication \u2013 turn to your garden for wholesome sustenance.\nAlthough it's tough to identify the underlying cause of autoimmune deficiency, we at Hallelujah Acres believe that following a raw, plant-based diet can make a positive impact on those living with autoimmune diseases and disorders. We've received multiple testimonies on how the Hallelujah Diet lifestyle has made a difference in the lives of those living with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and more.\n\"I'm happy to report that here at Hallelujah Acres we've had success with many of the autoimmune diseases,\" wrote Rev. Malkmus. \"They seem to respond favorably to the living foods that God intended for us.\"\nBecause 60 to 80 percent of our immune system is located in the gut, prioritizing digestion is key for strengthening the defense system and reducing the chance that it becomes compromised. Following a raw, plant-based diet that's loaded with enzymatically rich fruits and vegetables will keep gut health in check. It's all about fueling your body with the foods from the earth as God intended \u2013 with His basic nutritional building blocks, your immune system will run smoothly and you'll be able to self-heal, just as He planned.\nWith the proper diet and supplements, your body can heal and restore itself and prevent diseases from developing in the future. Trust in His guidance on your path to optimal health.\nI\u2019m presently experiencing weaknesses which i can\u2019t say where it comes, I have done various tests like liver function, that of kidney and others yet nothing seems to be wrong but as a follower of your diets though I stopped for some time due to the high cost of your products but decide to start a 21 day detoxification with green vegetables,carrot,lettuce , cucumber,juiced and unjuiced plus two of your products :Barley Max and Fiber Cleanse. Is there any other thing to add?\nThe Hallelujah Diet is a concept of keeping out junk foods and toxins and pouring in nutrition. Juicing truly is one of the most powerful things one can do. (And we continually here terrific comments on BarleyMax.) Celery and Cucumber make a great base for freshly extracted juices and then add from there. I really enjoy adding parsley and cilantro.\nAs far as supplements go, there are so many great ones. One that seems to really give me energy is the Selenium/Glutathione promoter. Glutathione is referred to as the master antioxidant of the cell, because it is present in large quantities and is able to regenerate other antioxidants. Glutathione is also a key molecule for detoxification in the liver, and plays a role countering inflammation in the body. The blend of items in the Selenium/Glutathione promoter is designed to boost your immune system defenses to stimulate the increased production of glutathione in the body.\nI hope whatever path you choose you find the vibrancy you desire. Doctors are good at diagnostic tests so it may be a good idea to keep a good doctor in the loop, especially if you choose to do any fasting. Also, do not hesitate to give the Hallelujah Diet Call Center a ring at 1-800-915-9355. M \u2013 F 8am \u2013 6pm and Sat. 9am- 4pm EST.\nTo me, discovering that so much of our immune system lies in our intestinal tract is one of the things that surprised me the most when I was learning about the Hallelujah Diet and it\u2019s benefits. Probiotics, digestive enzymes, and proper diet can make all the difference in the world!",

    "text": "Sometimes, she says, she is out on Dublin bay in her Laser and wonders why she didn\u2019t pick a team sport, asks herself why it has ended up like this?\nThere are no regrets, no second guessing her choices, no criticism of the sport she loves. Just passing thoughts on how things become the way they become?\nHow it is she ended up a solo sailor, alone for hours trimming fractions from her boat and from the wind and two stone from her body to coax her Laser to go faster?\nHere in Dun Laoghaire they fondly call her Annalise, an Olympian who carries her status lightly. People know her name, know what she looks like. After Rio they hung a giant poster of her down the side of the National Yacht Club and each morning the commuters driving to into the city and the people walking the east pier, could share the pride.\nAround here the Murphy is silent. She is simply Annalise like Sonia remains Sonia and Katie has always been Katie.\nShe says she is naturally gregarious and that doing it on her own, the hours on the water in Rio or Dublin Bay and recently in Lisbon, can get lonely.\nTalking up her success and position in sailing is anathema to her and if she does, it is guarded and almost begrudging. She is tough on herself. She has anxiety about her ability, questions whether she can do the things people expect of her, will it all be a success or a big flat belly flop? And all this after Rio.\n\u201cI\u2019m still the same person,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Olympic Games changed me that much. I still have the exact same fears that I had before.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a little bit more confidence in my sailing ability, but not that much more. I still have fears that that I\u2019m not going to be good enough.\nIt\u2019s an eternally searching position from a sailor who dramatically fell off the podium in London 2012, then turned a crisis of confidence into a silver medal.\nWhen she knew everyone was watching to see if she would fall, she rose. Rio and Irish Olympic history now define her.\nStill, the confidence wanes and grows with each achievement, the doubt an incitement to drive and build. Her internal disposition is a steady stream of self provocation. It never allows her stay still.\nToday though, she has her eyes on the world and all of its water in the Volvo Ocean Race. The name alone is majestic in its breadth and sweep. From her solo success, Annalise has \u2018crewed up\u2019.\nFor almost a year, the boat will own her. As one of 10 she has now declared herself a team player.\n\u201cI get lonely all the time,\u201d she explains. \u201cI don\u2019t really like being by myself. Generally I like to be around people, hang out with people. Chat away.\nShe has more plunged than dipped her toe into the high end of muscle boats, the Ocean going Volvo 65 designed specifically for the race.\nNo paint on the inside, just a black carbon canvas. Spare. \u201cIt\u2019s dark downside,\u201d she says. A coat of paint to brighten it would be another layer of weight. Too much.\nAll seven teams in the 45,000 nautical mile journey have exactly the same boat, one design and an allowance of two sets of sails for the entire race, a restriction to stop money talking too loudly.\nThe bunk beds are sweet, she says. They are rigged to a pulley system so if it\u2019s rough the crew can haul themselves the whole way up and wedge against the carbon fibre wall, snug like a burrito on a grill.\nIt means in their four hours on, four hours off around the clock roster they don\u2019t flip into the water sloshing around inside the sleeping quarters.\nPrior to her recent stints of training she had never slept overnight on a boat. Whether it was racing her Olympic Laser, or against men in the foiling Moths, she has been successfully sailing, but until now it had always been a few hours on the bay then back to shore.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only ever slept on this boat. I\u2019d 48 hours, the longest I\u2019ve been on it,\u201d she says, coolly pocketing that challenge.\n\u201cBeing thrown into this team is refreshing. It\u2019s a whole group of people doing the same thing and all wanting the same outcome.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s terrifying, the whole race. It\u2019s so hard. I think it\u2019s going to make me feel that Olympic sailing was the easiest thing in the world. Not in terms of the technical preparation but in terms of the mental attitude.\nThe first leg from Lisbon in Portugal to Alacante in Spain is a sprint, 700 nautical miles, the same as around Ireland and only few days ride. Leg three, Cape Town to Melbourne is 6,500 miles and leg seven, Auckland to Itaja in Brazil may define their race.\nIt\u2019s the longest leg and cruel, 7,600 nautical miles and almost all of it through some of the coldest, roughest ocean in the world.\nThe fleet leaves Auckland on March 18th and heads south past New Zealand\u2019s East Cape and into the Southern Ocean.\nOnce far enough south they will turn and race from west to east, catching the low pressure systems circulating around Antarctica. There will be big seas. There will be big winds. And there will be icebergs.\nOnce across that vast expanse of wilderness the boats take on the legendary Cape Horn and turn north, following the coast of Argentina, Uruguay and finally Brazil and Itaja\u00ed.\n\u201cExcited. Terrified,\u201d says Annalise of the challenge ahead. \u201cWorried about the dangers involved in the race . . . I\u2019m looking forward to what our team can do . . . we are young and enthusiastic.\n\u201cI guess my family are excited for me. They are definitely worried. But they\u2019ve done mad things as well in their life.\nFor all of her wise cracking and underplay she is the most successful female sailor Ireland has ever had. Those who watch carefully know that her natural cheer is authentic and the gallows humour her way of deflecting from a talent and success that keeps moving forward.\nOcean racers are not Olympic racers. Like frontiersmen, mountaineers or free divers they bear the miles of endurance like battle scars. The moulded unadorned fibreglass interiors are not so much a disdain for comfort as preparedness for sacrifice.\nShe throws a pitying smile when hardship is mentioned. It\u2019s as though comfort is the most virulent kind of serial killer. She is empathetic, benevolent and kindly to a land lubber. But unflinching.\n\u201cI think people have dealt with worse than not showering for three weeks. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a deal breaker,\u201d she says calmly. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll all be smelly together.\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s going to be the best thing I can do. This is the first time I have thought I could actually do professional sailing. It\u2019s hard when you are just an Olympic sailor. You are so well skilled but if you want to get onto a big boat, to be a tactician . . . this gives me opportunity.\n\u201cI mean Olympic sailing is so hard and I\u2019m hard on myself.\n\u201cI found it very difficult between London and Rio because I started to sail badly in 2014 and then my whole idea of an Olympic medal began to disappear. I thought maybe it\u2019s not going to happen for me, that I\u2019m going to work so hard over the next years and I\u2019m just not good enough.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even see the light at the end of the tunnel. All I could see was three more years. Do I have to do three more years of this? Feeling that I\u2019m not good enough. That I\u2019m never going to get to where I want to get to. This gives me a perfect 10 month break even though I\u2019ll be sailing 24 hours a day.\nThe boat \u2018Turn The Tide On Plastic\u2019 has an overt environmental theme as well as gender equality. There is an even split of five men and five women. Most of the crew are under 30.\nVeteran Irish sailor Damian Foxall is also in the race and part of the Vestas team. He has competed in five Volvo Ocean Races and won it as part of Groupama in 2011-12.\nHe also set a round-the-world speed record onboard G-Class catamaran Cheyenne. Kerry of course, he is a Derrynane boy gripped with ocean fever.\nFoxall has fallen overboard in the race only to be picked up by a boat that was coincidentally taking the same course. In five-metre waves 1,200 miles from land, Dutch friend Hans Horrevoets was fatally washed away from ABN AMRO.\nDeath is there and all the sailors know it. But it is not what the race is about. It is an eye opening, life changing voyage.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Murphy adds. \u201cI\u2019m the medic too.\u201d She raises her arm in the air to show the veins running from her wrist along the inside of her forearm and describes her efforts to insert a canella. The simple medical procedure becames a splatter movie with blood fizzing into the air like a shaken bottle of cola.\nShe recites the drill as if by rote.\n\u201cWe have a camping gas stove. We have a kettle. Pour it into the freeze dried. Mix the freeze dried. Leave it to rehydrate. Eat it. Make sure you leave it for 15 minutes. Otherwise it will make you sick.\n\u201cIt will be hard for me mentally every day to get through each day,\u201d she adds more earnestly. \u201cWhen you are on each leg you have to think that it is never going to end. You can\u2019t be counting down the days. It\u2019s an endurance test. You have to think like that. That\u2019s mentally very hard.\nAsked for five words that define what she is doing, how she feels about casting off and she gives back 59. Ideas and emotions swim in her head, almost in overload, banging off each other.\nAnd off she goes rubbing her lower forehead for the imaginary lost eyebrows. Off she goes, infectious, self deprecating, talented, doubting, conquering. Off she goes to discover a new world.\nThe total distance for the 2017-18 edition will be 45,000 nautical miles and is the longest route in the history of the race that was formerly known as the Whitbread Round the World Race. It typically sailed a distance of about 32,000 nautical miles.\nA total of 12,500 nautical miles will be raced in the Southern Ocean, a hostile, freezing environment renowned for boat-breaking storms and gruelling conditions. Most stages of the race range in length from 700 to 6,500 nautical miles. Port stopovers are usually less than two weeks in duration but there are also several \u2018pit-stops\u2019 of just a few days at key locations.\nThe fleet comprises seven teams while an eighth - for which a brand-new boat is available - did not materialise.\nOut of 77 sailors, there are a total of 18 female sailors, the biggest proportion ever following a concerted effort by the organisers to ensure teams would be mixed. As an incentive, teams opting for an all-male line-up must race with fewer crew; none have taken this option. Teams are also required to have under 30\u2019s included in their crew panel.\nThere are 28 sailors participating for the first time and 14 sailors across the seven teams that have won the race before. There will be 18 nations represented in the total crew line-up.\nAnnalise Murphy is one of several Rio 2012 Olympic medallists selected to compete in this race. Her inclusion required a crash course in offshore sailing including Sea Survival training, Yachtmaster theory courses as well as medical training as she is also the designated medic on board \u201cTurn the Tide on Plastic\u201d. She has not previously competed in an offshore/trans-oceanic race.\nIreland has been represented in the race on winning teams on three separate occasions. Cork sailor Justin Slattery won the race in 2005-2006 on board ABN AMRO 1 with skipper Mike Sanderson. He also won the last edition of the race with Ian Walker on Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing. Kerryman Damian Foxall won the race in 2011-12 with French skipper Franck Cammas on Groupama, lifting the trophy on home turf as that edition of the race finished in Galway.\nMurphy is only the third Irish woman to compete in this round the world race. Previously, Susan Kavanagh raced on Norsk Data in the 1985-86 Whitbread. Angela Farrell raced in the first all-woman team with Tracy Edwards on Maiden in the 1989-90 race.\nIreland has had two previous flagged entries in the race. NCB Ireland was the Irish designed and built 82-foot maxi skippered by the late Joe English that competed in the 1989-90 Whitbread race. Green Dragon skippered by Ian Walker competed in the 2008-09 Volvo Ocean Race. Both projects were conceived by Galway\u2019s Enda O\u2019Coineen who mounted his own Vendee Globe solo ocean race entry last year that ended prematurely with a dismasting close to New Zealand\u2019s South Island.",

I bought a larger size hoping they would fit better but no. They are very tight in the toe box and can only be worn a short period of time.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Workingmom12 from Wow! I walk about 20,000 steps a day at work. When I bought these shoes I was amazed at how much better my feet and legs felt! How did I not know shoes like this existed? No more foot pain at night! They support my feet so well. It helps with my overpronation!\nRated 5 out of 5 by scarrera from great for my feet! I used to always get shin splints when I ran. Then I figured out that was likely because of overpronation! These shoes have been great. My feet feel way more supported as I run, and no more shin splints!",

    "text": "Comic science fiction or comedy science fiction is a subgenre of soft\u2005science\u2005fiction or science\u2005fantasy that exploits the science-fiction (SF) genre's conventions for comedic effect. Comic science fiction often mocks or satirizes standard SF conventions - such as alien\u2005invasion of Earth, interstellar\u2005travel, or futuristic technology. It can also satirize and criticize present-day society.\nAn early example was the Pete\u2005Manx series by Henry\u2005Kuttner and Arthur\u2005K.\u2005Barnes (sometimes writing together and sometimes separately, under the house pen-name of Kelvin Kent). Published in Thrilling\u2005Wonder\u2005Stories in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the series featured a time-traveling carnival barker who uses his con-man abilities to get out of trouble. Two later series cemented Kuttner's reputation as one of the most popular early writers of comic science fiction: the Gallegher series (about a drunken inventor and his narcissistic robot) and the Hogben series (about a family of mutant hillbillies). The former appeared in Astounding\u2005Science\u2005Fiction in 1943 and 1948 and was collected in hardcover as Robots\u2005Have\u2005No\u2005Tails (Gnome, 1952), and the latter appeared in Thrilling Wonder Stories in the late 1940s. In the 1950s comedy became more common in science fiction.[citation\u2005needed] Some of the authors contributing included: Alfred\u2005Bester, Harry\u2005Harrison, C.M.\u2005Kornbluth, Frederik\u2005Pohl, and Robert\u2005Sheckley.\nThe\u2005Hitchhiker's\u2005Guide\u2005to\u2005the\u2005Galaxy is a comic science-fiction series written by Douglas\u2005Adams. Originally a\u2005radio\u2005comedy broadcast on BBC\u2005Radio\u20054 in 1978, it later morphed into other formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a 1981\u2005TV\u2005series, a 1984\u2005computer\u2005game, and 2005\u2005feature\u2005film. A prominent series in British\u2005popular\u2005culture, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has become an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005.\nTerry\u2005Pratchett's 1981 novel Strata also exemplifies the comic science fiction genre.\nRed\u2005Dwarf primarily consists of a television sitcom that aired on BBC\u2005Two between 1988 and 1999, and on Dave since 2009, gaining a cult\u2005following. As of 2018[update] eleven full series of the show plus one \"special\" miniseries have aired. The latest series, dubbed Red\u2005Dwarf\u2005XII, started airing in October 2017.\n^ \"Comedy\u2005Science\u2005Fiction\". Sfbook.com.

    "text": "At the end of each year, SFI takes time to give thanks, reflect on the past year, and look forward to the next year. We continue to work with a diverse network to expand our reach and commitment to future forests. We encourage you to review our two-page scorecard of our 2017 successes and partnerships.\nI am proud of the SFI community for promoting responsible supply chains, elevating the conservation values associated with working forests across landscapes, and being committed to education and community engagement. Together, we stand for future forests.\nProject Learning Tree (PLT) became a program of SFI \u2013 PLT is an award-winning environmental education program that uses trees and forests as windows on the world to increase youth understanding of the environment. PLT will help us develop the next generation of forest and conservation leaders and we are already seeking ways to expand PLT and leverage our networks. We also established PLT Canada as a nonprofit in August.\nSFI Surpasses 300 Million Acres \u2013 Forests certified to the SFI Forest Management Standard now equal 305 million acres/123 million hectares in North America. This includes more than 20 million new acres/8 million hectares certified in 2017. The SFI Forest Management Standard represents a quarter of all certified lands globally and the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard positively impacts millions of acres of additional lands.\nConsumer Recognition of SFI Increases from 36% to 41% \u2013 Consumer recognition of SFI is higher than for any other forest certification standard, according to surveys of 20,000 U.S. consumers by the Natural Marketing Institute.\nMore than 20% of Fortune 100 Companies Use the SFI Label \u2013 Displaying the SFI logo helps consumers make good choices for forests.\nSFI Expands Green Building Market Access \u2013 Smartlam and Structurlam are the first two manufacturers of cross-laminated timber (CLT) to be certified to the the SFI Chain-of-Custody Standard. These companies can use certification to position themselves as suppliers in the green building market. Wood and paper products certified to SFI are now eligible to earn LEED or Green Globe credits. In addition, 92 two secondary manufacturers of the Wood Products Manufacturers Association (WPMA) simultaneously earned certification to the SFI 2015-2021 Chain-of-Custody (COC) Standard making it the largest single group certified to the SFI COC Standard at once.\nPEFC Recognition of the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard \u2013 This recognition of SFI in PEFC\u2019s Chain-of-Custody certification helps provide market access to SFI Program Participants who sell products in nearly 130 countries.\nThe SFI Forest Partners Program at 9.2 Million Acres \u2013 As we wrap up the first phase of this program, we have 9.2 million acres certified/confirmed. State lands in Louisiana, Missouri and Arkansas were certified in 2017. This certification along with the ongoing support of our program funders Time Inc., the National Geographic Society, Macmillan Publishers, Pearson, and Hearst made this success possible. In 2018, we plan to extend the SFI Forest Partners Program across the U.S. and Canada to increase forest management, fiber sourcing and chain-of-custody certification.\nSFI Partners to Quantify the Conservation Impact of SFI\u2019s Footprint \u2013 This initiative focuses on developing metrics for carbon storage, climate change mitigation, water quality and biodiversity on lands certified to SFI standards as well as larger landscapes influenced by positive programs including the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard. Quantifying these environmental benefits will promote understanding of the conservation values associated with sustainably managed forests. SFI organized the SFI Conservation Impact Sounding Board, an informal group of scientists, drawn from academia, public agencies, and the non-profit conservation community, to guide the project. Participating organizations at the 2017 Sounding Board meeting included: SFI Program Participants, Virginia Tech, Nature Conservancy of Canada, American Forest Foundation, Ducks Unlimited Canada, American Bird Conservancy, Saskatchewan Research Council, Canadian Forest Service, NatureServe, American Institute of Biological Sciences, and the U.S. Forest Service.\nThe SFI Conservation and Community Partnerships Grant Program Continues to Expand \u2013 SFI conservation grants feature collaboration from 37 different groups with a focus on carbon storage, wildlife habitat, species at risk, and forests with exceptional conservation value. SFI community grants feature collaboration from 50 different groups with a focus on projects that engage local communities through a variety of initiatives including youth outreach, supporting Indigenous values, forest education programs, and green building projects for low-income families.\nIndigenous Engagement in the SFI Community Keeps Growing \u2013 In 2017 Obishikokaang Resources Corporation certified more than 1 million hectares to the SFI Standard. This enhances forestry operations, sustainability and economic development for the Lac Seul First Nation in Northern Ontario. In addition, TimberWest became the first SFI Program Participant to be certified under the Progressive Aboriginal Relations Program.\nSFI and Habitat for Humanity Continue to Partner \u2013 In 2017, Mark Rodgers, the CEO of Habitat for Humanity Canada became chair of the SFI Board of Directors and we continue to work together at the national and local levels to expand our impact. We worked with Habitat for Humanity Greater Ottawa to organize Women in Wood, Indigenous and Youth Build Days in Ottawa over the summer. We also have a strong partnership to grow the Habitat for Humanity Indigenous Housing Program.\nAnnual Conference, held in Ottawa, in recognition of Canada\u2019s 150th \u2013 This year was the largest SFI Annual Conference ever and it featured a joint session with the Canadian Institute of Forestry attended by over 500 people. The event featured a variety of international speakers and SFI awarded Maine the SFI Implementation Committee Achievement Award, J.D. Irving (JDI) the SFI Leadership in Conservation Award, and Craig Blair the SFI President\u2019s Award. The event also recognized Inger Andersen, Director General of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the 151st Woman for Nature. For more details on the event, see our conference wrap up, and check out our conference video.\nSave the date and attend our 2018 Annual Conference in Colorado, Oct. 16-18. It promises to be yet another landmark in the growth of the SFI community.\nIn 2018, SFI will continue to find new ways to collaborate and communicate directly with our network. We value your ideas and input and congratulate you for all you do on behalf of forests, our communities and our shared quality of life.",

    "text": "Just a hurried note. We are all well and delighted with your bright letters. We are very busy with work and pleasure. Francis and Ella must tell you of their outings with your mother.\nYour Auntie Aggie came to tea so that I do not feel quite free. She is working overtime at office until Thursday week and does not reach home until about 9:20pm and we only see her on Sundays.\nDo you know anything yet about your volume for presentation to St Paul\u2019s School library?\nHow you offer money? I will send a \u00a31 next week but do not hesitate to let me know directly you need any, if it does arrive before.\nWe have had mild weather and much wet until yesterday when it turned over a new leaf. Yesterday and today have been bright and dry and consequently colder but not serious. We shall get it yet.\nOur vicar devoted half of his sermon this morning to an idea I touched upon in the January Magazine - the apparent failure but real triumph of many lives. I felt flattered.\nAnother week I will try to get my letter in advance during the week. I might have done so yesterday but was rather rushed with other matters before the evening was over and did not do all I wanted.\nYour aunt Maria has had another nasty attack of bronchitis.\nand then it is payable only through a bank and if it goes wrong it can be traced and recovered. But for small amounts we do not usually care to give the trouble of paying the order into a bank. It is no trouble to tradesmen, - they pay in almost every day.\nI shall hope to hear your health continues good hand that your work and your cocoas agree with you. We had to 3 bright days about last Sunday - then returned to rainy mild weather, - and today it has got cold again. The Sun however more than repays.\nCyril and I have been up at seven working before breakfast every morning. His algebra and trig: are rather difficult and though I can help a little, he wants even more. Still he finds it encouraging to have someone to discuss his difficulties with and I shall help him up to revision which is the most important factor.\nFrancis was later at her social last evening.\nElla and your mother have kept to the usual quiet routine.\nDid you mean that 3/6 was charged for blacking the bike in addition to 2/6 for cleaning and storage? I should not have had it done. We could have put on enough black in 10 minutes at a cost of a few pence. But never mind. Learn by experience.\nit is usual for us to confirm to the proverbial English custom of talking of the weather and the rapid passage of time. As I wrote a few days ago it is not surprising that the well worn topics occur to me most naturally. To date this letter February strikes me forcibly that the New Year flies as quickly as the old ones and then, looking out of the window, I noticed the rain falling as it did so freely last year.\nFrancis has just gone to Sunday school but Cyril has abandoned the idea of going to the Crusaders. I had intended taking your mother out but the rain was too bad. I wonder how it is affecting my daughters who have gone away and left me! I hope they did not suffer this morning. I shall be curious to know whether you have it much colder at Cambridge than we get it here.\nThis has been a quiet working week so that I have not much to tell.\nMr Williams preached his last sermon at St Mary\u2019s this morning. He has left Huran Rd and I understand Mr Johnson is taking the flat. Mrs Heath is forming a working party for Lent and has asked your mother to assist which of course she does with some deprecating remarks to me.\nIt will be delightful for you if Mildred can come and see you for Commem: but I should think the journey would be rather expensive.\nAre you still thinking of taking science for your second and third years at Cambridge?\nWe shall be interested to know how you get on with your time papers.\nSir Walter Howell, (photo right) - a man who entered the civil service by a similar exam to mine but seven months later, became Assistant Secretary Board of Trade died suddenly of angina pectoris (heart disease) last Wednesday. I had tea with him about six weeks ago and when he told me he was a bachelor I thought to myself I did not envy him with all his luxurious surroundings.\nI suppose you do not get much time for reading fiction or news. The picture papers help one to keep up with the times quickest but I prefer to read a good article, or a good letter, or a good debate. The debate on Woman\u2019s Suffrage I sent to Mildred. I wish the militants would behave themselves. If you are in favour of votes for women you need not trouble much as votes would not make much difference, - certainly not as much as they think.\nI was very interested in your doings and understood them better when I saw the notice of the doings at Cambridge given in the Church Times. That you were disappointed with Bishop Gore I can quite understand. He is supposed to write better than he can speak. When I heard him I thought him rather tedious with regard to Suffrage for women. You know I am in favour of giving some of them votes but I am not enthusiastic and should not be ready for any sacrifice at the present time. After you have had greater experience you will hesitate about yielding to one side until you have heard all that can be said on the other. Mildred has been converted very slowly and reluctantly and consequently has deeper roots than if she had adopted the ideas very readily.\nI don't often drop on your spelling but I may tell you Gymkhana is one word and has an h.\nMy view on Parliament and voting and laws is this - In cases of need people have to be convinced of the need for a change. If they are not convinced it does not matter who votes the laws won'tbe made and even if they were made they would only create opposition, - they would not work, - they would not be obeyed.\nWhen people are convinced again it does not matter much who votes, the alteration is soon made if it works. But apart from that is no reason why a woman who pays taxes should not vote. One even might admit that in the case of man and wife they pay equal shares. But bringing in all the poorest and greatly increasing the electorate by adding all undesirables is not to my mind. What is to be gained?\nOf course I should like to see degrees of the legal profession thrown open to women so that they might have a chance.\nBut don't let this interfere much with your Maths.\nI wonder whether your weather has been like ours, mostly very wet and mild. Yesterday was exceptional, excellent, charming, dry, balmy, brilliant sunshine; but wet again today.\nCyril is not much at letter writing. He continues to rise early although was not very good last week. He had a good turn with the Scouts yesterday felling trees in some grounds belonging to Mr Carmichael.\nLast Tuesday at the Whist Drive low scores were made by your mother, me, Francis & Uncle Satlker but Aunty Stalker took first prize. She got a lovely scent case or box. The Stalkers are coming for the evening tomorrow.\nWhen do your .....? commence? - The first week in March? You will be able to get Mildred to help you with difficulties if she comes on the 22nd. I think she will.\nElla is having a contest for the Gym team that day & I have been wondering whether I will go. Francis says she will write to you during this week. You know Sunday is a busy day for her.\nDo you want more money yet? Let me know when you do. Aunt Maria came over to tea with Aggie this afternoon & brought a picture of Grandma enlarged from the group. It is good when thoroughly examined but the veil spoils the first glance.\nAunt Maria says she is allright now. She will come to stay for a time next Saturday.\nWe are delighted when we hear you are in good health. Take great care of my precious daughter, and bring her home safely in a few week's time.\nI was about to commence by writing that your great time had passed but I remember you have a great many times at Newnham. However one happy time has gone and I hope you will have many more in store.\nNext Saturday a party is coming down and I expect Aunties Aggie & Maria. Your mother and Ella will be in the party. They are due to arrive at Cambridge at 12.40 and will go to the centre by tram and have lunch. You will have to decide whether you will meet them at the Station and lunch with them or meet them afterwards. Mildred took me to a very nice place where we had table d'hote I think for 1/6. Perhaps you would find out about it beforehand and also whether there is a Lyons or any similar place where they can obtain cheaper refreshments if they desire them. Then you will want a programme ready. They will want to see the Chapel at Kings and had better proceed there immediately as Aggie will be at the Chess Board from 3 until about 6pm.\nI suppose you can entertain three at tea in your room and it will be well to have preparations made in the morning. I will send a sovereign about Tuesday and your mother shall bring more when she comes.\nI suppose it will not interfere unduly with your studies as you ought to have a rest just before an exam. However if you decide you ought not to give up the time let us know at once so that we can arrange accordingly. I am not certain when they will return but probably about 7 when you go to dinner.\nThey must do all their sightseeing about the town between 1.30 and 4.30, and they will then be quite ready for rest and a cup of tea. You can then show them your college Grounds about 5.30.\nNow for our record. Ella will have told you of her success yesterday. I must admit I sympathise with Godolphin. They did everything so well it was hard for them to lose. But they took it very nicely. It was a great pleasure for your mother and me to witness the display.\nIt was very delightful to have happy letters from you and Mildred this morning. They were the best of birthday presents in themselves. I am sure you know how glad I am to have your loving thoughts. Your puzzle tomorrow will be how to make the best of the time between 12.40 and 6.40. I think they (Mother, Ella etc) should take tram or bus into centre, go to lunch, then on to Kings' by way of such places as occur to you. Then gradually meander by way of the backs to College to tea.\nAggie has to be at the Boar's Head at 3pm to play Chess & may not be free until about 6. I think she ought to leave Newnham College until then but if she wishes to see it by daylight you must leave your mother & Aunt Maria somewhere whilst you take Aggie to and over the College.\nYou will howver be able to discuss matters at lunch.\nI can only hope you may have sunshine. Best wishes for the Exam next week and for a safe arrival home. Your mother brings more money. She & I are just going to Brondesbury for the evening.\nThe enclosed catalogue came here some days ago addressed to you and Ella might have brought it yesterday. Anyhow it is no use here and it may be to you.\nWe were rather surprised last evening to see the travallers back home again so soon but very glad to hear such a good account of you. I hope the exam: this week will not kill you, - that you will not be very anxious about the result. It is only preparation for May or June. Have you decided what to do with your bicycle? There would be some advantage in bringing it up so that we could take it to pieces & thoroughly examine it & put anything right, but if you are only home for a month it is just questionable whether it is worth the trouble and expense. Do just as you like but let me know beforehand so that I can arrange accordingly.\nI am hesitating what to write as I suppose you heard everything yesterday.\nMrs Balding is still laid up and has a touch of bronchitis but she has been assured that an operation for her other disorder is unnecessary.\nI expect you know your mother and I went to the Revell's on Thursday and to Buff's on Friday.\nNow I will wish you goodnight, - and that you may speedily pass your week's work and return to a haven of rest.\nbracelet in commemoration of her 21st birthday. It is very handsome and she is very delighted.\nI got very fagged twoards the end of the week and have not kept up the early rising with Cyril very well. We get some teasing Maths and shall be very glad of your assistance. He could go forward much more rapidly with a good coach. I hope you will take him on when you return although he is an awkward customer.\nElla keeps herself exclsuivelty to herself although I am sure she would do much better if she would talk about the history she is reading. It would help her to fix it in her mind. Both she and Cyril seem fairly well in health just now. The latter is keen on scouting and chopped down a tree yesterday.\nAunt Maria has a nasty cough through not taking proper care after washing her hair.\nRoy Bennett has gone to Nottingham to work.\nThe new curate arrives tomorrow.\nYour mother has been busy in trying to arrange for a home for her half-sister Polly & has found some difficulty but we shall surmount it.\nIt is shockingly late (11.20) so I must wish you Good Night and God bless you.",

    "text": "We recently performed a test on artemis broker and found a severe performance issue.\nWhen paged messages are being consumed, decrementMetrics in QueuePendingMessageMetrics will try to \u2018getMessage\u2019 to check whether they are durable or not. In this way queue will be locked for a long time because page may be GCed and need to be reload entirely. Other operations rely on queue will be blocked at this time, which cause a significant TPS drop. Detailed stacks are attached below.\nThis also happens when consumer is closed and messages are pushed back to the queue, artemis will check priority on return if these messages are paged.\nTo solve the issue, durable and priority need to be cached in PagedReference just like messageID, transactionID and so on. I have applied a patch to fix the issue. Any review is appreciated.\nshould use durable field or additional flag to see if its been cached, messageID maybe cached already but not durable. possibly make the held field a byte with 0 = false, 1 = true and -1 not set.\n@michaelandrepearce Thanks for the review. Now I have changed the code at your suggestion.\nJust looking over this a bit more. As the page ref needs to be a small as possible.\nThe whole point of paging is to remove it from memory to be able to scale, there is a little we need to keep but we need to be super frugal. This is more important that we keep paging lean over perf, an ideal world paging would mean nothing was left in memory tbh, and thus mean broker could scale limitless to memory and then only disk. as performance wise already consumer are not keeping up and therefor e2e latencies are going to be massively out. If you care for that you shouldnt be paging in first place.\nI get the durable point as metrics are done on every consumed message and would be on a frequent / hot path, But im less convinced in the priority one.\nWith regards to priority i dont see this being accessed or affecting a hot path its only on messages being added to message references. On intial adding during address to queue routing the message will be in memory still at this point. In regards to a consumer closing and having unhandled messages. This isnt on hot path imo, nor should be treated like a frequent event and shouldnt be tuning for that, eg you expect consumers to be long lived in a throughput or latency world and only go away rarely.\nBased on this are you ok to remove the priority addition?\nThere are some cases will perform lots of rollbacks in a short period of time. For example if we would like to upgrade our server while thousands of consumers are receiving message, the close of server causes massive rollbacks to original address. Thus queue might blocked on reading GC'ed pages and during this period all ActiveMQ-server threads are blocked too, no operations could be done. Under this circumstance it will take more than 5-10 minutes(e.g 2000 consumers) to completely remove all consumers, which is too long time for downstream systems.\nYes we do find similar blocks in PagedReferenceImpl::getScheduledDeliveryTime() since if deliveryTime is not set it will call getMessage() during rollback.\nTo these two situations, detailed stacks are shown in attachment.\nConsidering priority only occupy one byte, it might be worthwhile to add it in PageRef to improve stability:) As for deliveryTime, since it is already in PageRef, we can simply add this.deliveryTime = message.getMessage().getScheduledDeliveryTime(); in constructor to avoid block on rollback.\nIts very unusual for consumers to go away as it is good design in most mom a consumer is long lived. Like wise upgrade is a non normal event.\nSo without priority removed im -1 this. As i stated in an ideal world everything in paging would be off heap, we shouldnt just end up with every value in page ref, else we lose the reason for paging originals intent which is to remove the message from heap at penalty that it will be slower. If you want faster add more ram so more can be kept on heap.\nNot adding priority is acceptable since it's rare. I will later remove the priority part.\nAnd how about deliveryTime? It's already in PageRef and might need to be set in the constructor.\nYes you could add this to set in the section within the constructor where message != null, seems sensible.\nfor completeness (its a nit) set deliveryTime to its undefined value here.\n@franz1981 i was going to merge this, but im away in another country without my main computer with my apache git ssh cert key. Could you merge this for me.\nPlease due to a change can you rebase this one?",

    "text": "The term mind-body connection means that you use your thoughts to influence and improve your body\u2019s physical condition. Conversely, you improve your physical condition to improve your mental condition. Improving your mind-body connection will yield maximum health benefits. The primary way to strengthen and improve your mind-body connection is by incorporating lifestyle changes that will help you reduce stress, strengthen your body and improve your emotional state of mind; this will in turn encourage your body\u2019s natural healing processes.\nIncorporate relaxation exercises into your daily routine. You can spend as little as 15 minutes a day relaxing your body and your mind, which will reduce tension, stress and anxiety.\nSit quietly and focus on your breathing. Take at least 3 deep breaths, exhaling slowly after each breath. Then continue to sit and breathe quietly for another 5 minutes. This isn\u2019t a meditation, it is simply taking a few minutes to get centered and calm.\nAlternately tense and release your muscle groups. (This is also referred to as progressive muscle relaxation.) Begin with your feet and work all the way to your face and head. Simply tighten your muscles for a few seconds and then release. Allow a few seconds to feel each muscle group relax.\nMentally scan your body from head to toe. Become aware of any area that feels tense and concentrate on relieving that tenseness. For example, if you have a cramp in your shoulder, tighten and release those muscles until your shoulder feels loose and relaxed.\nFocus on happy thoughts and memories after you are completely relaxed. You can recall a pleasant encounter with a friend, visualize your favorite flower or conjure up one of the happiest memories you have, such as your wedding day, or the day you graduated from college.\nTake 3 more deep, cleansing breaths after you have entertained pleasant thoughts for at least 5 minutes.\nEnter into a meditation or use guided imagery to further calm your mind and body. Think of guided imagery as a self-directed daydream. See yourself going about your day with calmness and meeting success in all your endeavors. Some people like to use guided imagery audio tapes, but you can create your own routine. This is a particularly effective method to use if you are experiencing any anxiety about an upcoming project or a job interview. Mentally see yourself as successfully negotiating any situation that is causing you concern.\nGet regular massages. If a weekly massage is not in your budget, ask a family member or close friend to give you a light massage once a week. It can be as simple as a shoulder rub. Physical massage is a great way to relieve tension and improve blood circulation. Massages also facilitate the natural healing process in your body.\nExplore a spiritual practice. Attend church services or join a prayer and meditation group. Prayer and meditation can relieve anxiety, pain, stress, depression and insomnia.\nTake up a hobby. Any activity that gives you enjoyment will help calm you, and it can serve as a form of meditation. Try writing, painting, stamp collecting, or gardening. You could also take up a new sport that you\u2019ve always wanted to try.\nYou can also try the art of shaking. This is a form of mind body medicine that allows one to free their mind and release stress through the form of dancing. You can find shaking music all over the internet and that's about all you need! Because most people don't like to dance in public or are afraid of what they will look like, encourage your participants to close their eyes while doing this activity. The energetic vibe that everyone will feel afterwards is so incredible.\nCan I bob instead of shaking?\nBob, shake, shimmy, hula, wiggle... the point is to get the body moving rhythmically!\nAny activity you engage in that results in a positive influence on your mental function, emotions and physiology will improve your mind-body connection.\nHire a professional mind-body connection coach. A trained professional can help you reach peak levels of peace and calm.\nDon\u2019t embark on any new physical routine, especially if it involves vigorous exercise, until you have consulted with your doctor.\nwikiHow is a \u201cwiki,\u201d similar to Wikipedia, which means that many of our articles are co-written by multiple authors.

    "text": "Who never wears a helmet? And why don't you wear a helmet?\nOrgan donors I would assume.\nI wear a helmet because I prefer my brain in my cranium as opposed to spread all over the highway. Fools ride without them.\nNo choice! ..................... But I would anyway.\nI never have worn a helmet. I have one accident (not my fault) under my belt.\nIt's a tricky question because it seems to really polarize folks.\nMy reasoning is: Helmets reduce my peripheral vision and eliminate my ability to hear. Further, they haven't invented a neck protector. Any wreck bad enough to do that kind of damage to my skull is very likely going to break my neck anyway.\nLike seatbelts in a cage, use of helmets or not begets controversy.\nWhen I see those road signs that state, BUCKLE UP... I say YES, buckle up.\nWe motorcyclists DON'T need you ejected from your vehicle and hitting us riders.\nThe question is not tricky! As note above it does make folks take sides for or against. Yes, you do have to turn your head a little further to see and execute necessary checks. One of the wonderful aspects of the Gold Wing is the quietness of the bike which greatly enhances ones ability to hear.\nI would urge you to do some study on head injuries and concussions to learn how small an impact to the head is required to cause damage. A helmet is not perfect nor is a seatbelt but both can measurable improve your chances for survival in a crash.\nYou live in a state with a mandatory helmet law. It's accepted that you do wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.\nIf you're riding across country, who would likely remove their helmet when riding through a state with no helmet law? And why would you do that?\nAlways a topic that guarantees conflict and controversy . Almost as bad as trying to discuss the 2nd Amendment and gun rights with a left-wing radical , anti-gun advocate .\nIn my fifty-five years of riding ; this subject is a one ; or the other . With absolutely no middle ground from one side . And one side only . Those who support mandatory helmet usage seem to think they have the right to every other rider that they are dumb , stupid , ignorant , Organ Donors , sub-human knuckle draggers , and a plethora of other names , not fit to print here . Sad . Very , very sad .\nI was heavily involved in the crafting of the Ohio helmet laws way back before many on this board were old enough to throw a leg over , and the one thing we sought was the \"MIDDLE GROUND\", that was acceptable to the riders , law-makers , and Insurance Companies . I think we got it right , cause there has been but a minor amount of tweaking to that law since . And I commend the tweaks . As they were directed at keeping new , and younger riders safer .\nI am not against helmet laws . Just pious , holier-than-thou Hypocrites who would , and do \"bag\" there helmets as soon as they cross that state line into a helmet free state . But play the \"I ALWAYS WEAR MY HELMET\", and \"EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD HAVE TO , TOO\" card at every opportunity . I see it every year at Arizona Bike week , and the Laughlin River Run . And please don't try to tell me that's just the H-D crowd . I've been to over a dozen ABW's and 20 River Runs . Not buyin it .\nSimply stated . No ! I do not wear a helmet unless I am in one of those Blue-state , Nanny states where one over-bearing , over-reaching political party thinks they have the right to tell me when to think , what to think , and how to think . I've logged almost four million miles on a motorcycle and the only injuries I've gotten was the two accidents I was wearing a helmet . Neck injuries due to the weight of the helmet displacing and separating C-4 and C-5 vertebrae .\nFor all you folks who like to quote data , and safety reports , go way back to around 1973 and get the British data on fatal crashes in the U.K... If memory serves ; there were approx. 110 riders killed in a two or three year period . Over 80% of those fatalities were the direct result of spinal separation between the 3rd and 5th cervical vertebrae . Anybody want to take a guess what is the only item that touches that part of the human anatomy , in a motorcycle wreck ? The bottom of your freakin HELMET . We used that data in arguing our case for the Ohio Helmet laws .\nGet over yourselves ; and let others live as they choose . \"Let those who ride\" --- DECIDE !\nMy opinion was asked for and I have stated it , clearly , and succinctly . If it offends you , that's on you , as I was highly offended by some of the snarky comments I've read in this thread . Brain-dead , Brain-bucket wearin morons who think they have a license to be insulting to anyone who disagrees with \"their\" point of view .\nThe word FREEDOM has a million definitions, this was one of them (slight RIP from Dragnet).\nAh, found it... \"Unsubscribe topic\"\nLast edited by FM-USA on Fri Jun 30, 2017 10:06 am, edited 1 time in total.\nAlways a topic that guarantees conflict and controversy.\nThat's what I was looking for!! A little bit of constructive conflict and controversy, to spice things up.\nMANY years ago, in the bike shop where I bought my first bike, there was a sign by the helmets that said, \"If you have a $10 head, buy a $10 helmet.\"\nI think most riders, unless they have a good head bunt (like, say, Gary Busey) can revise that quote to a ZERO value helmet.\n\"Most folks who don't think they need a helmet probably don't.\"\nAs I recall, that was the advertising slogan for Bell Helmets at the time.\nDon't worry about dying, you're gone. Don't worry about brain damage what's left of you won't care. But nobody thinks about the other injuries.\nA number of years ago while out on a Sunday fun run with friends, I had a major malfunction at freeway speed. Long story short, after 3 months in the hospital I'm home and checking out what's left of my helmet. The entire left side of my full face helmet from chin bar to brow vent was road rashed severely (and not just the paint). Without my helmet that day, that ride, that instance, my face would be something from a horror movie today.\nThat being what it is, I will fight for your right to ride helmet free, BUT I will make you listen to my story before you ride off.\nMy personal 2 cents. The operator should have the right to choose, but not the passenger.\nMy reasoning, the operator has control of the machine and has the passengers life in their hands and skills.\nAt 17 years old, I had a pickup truck turn left in front of me. I went over the hood of the truck, more or less flipped in the air, landed on my feet - still doing 30+ mph, and immediately slammed face first into the road. I slid on my front for a bit (don't remember this, but my jeans were worn through to the skin in front), and then must have tumbled, because I distinctly remember sliding along on my back, until I hit the curb, head first.\nI learned two lessons that day: 1) jeans don't protect at ALL against road rash, and 2) wear a helmet if you want to live. My life would have ended at 17 years of age if I hadn't been wearing one. The amount of damage my helmet took, while leaving my head completely unscathed made me a huge believer in helmets.\nI always wear a helmet and not because of any law or political opinions relating to the laws. Most of the time I use a 3/4 because they are so much cooler. One of the prerequisites when purchasing is related to the peripheral vision argument. There are helmets out there that don't block your vision. I can't see the sides of my helmet except for the extreme lower portion. No blocked vision at all.\nSince this thread is for those who never wear a helmet I won't submit this post.\nI wear one 99% and am nervous if I don't. Took the grand daughter out last evening and she wore the helmet I use. Felt good in great weather but it was like eating clowns. Tasted funny.\nFriend flew over a car three years ago. No helmet. Still blind.\nYour math is a little off ; but close . I've been riding for 55 years and my motorcycle has always been my primary transportation . Many own motorcycles as a weekend recreational vehicle , but I'm not one of , \"those guys\" . For years ; my daily back and forth to work was 145 miles . Buy gas for a cage for that trip for a year . The only state I haven't ridden in is Alaska ; and I've logged a almost trans-Canada trip back in the days when you didn't have to have a passport to go there . And gas stops were not within reach of your tanks capacity . Phoenix to Cleve. , Ohio to Montreal to Calgary and back down to Phoenix . And people spent more time behind a set of \"bars\" , than a key-board . Couple of short trips into Mexico , just cause it was close , and not the political issue it is now .\nI rode for the simple pleasure of riding . I've crossed country on Triumphs ; Ariel Square-four , Norton's and Honda's and like the catch phrase , it was about the ride . Had the pleasure of riding two Vincent's . A Black Knight and a Shadow . A Suzuki Rotary , and one of the first 750 Tridents in the country . I was a long-haired , dope-smoking , stretched front-end , chopper-ridin \"Biker\" , before \"Easy rider\" hit the big screen . And yup ! Even spent some days in some local county jails , livin the life-style . No big thang .....Don't mean nothin . Rode \"Patched\" , and solo . But I rode .\nPretty simple really. Should just be the rider's choice. Same with seat belts in my opinion. I always wear a helmet but it doesn't bother me if anyone else does or doesn't.",

In very good condition.\nBrard; ( 1788-1838 ) was a French mineralogist, and economic geologist. ?He studied mineralogy under Bronignart, and while still a student published his Manuel du Min\u00e9ralogiste et du G\u00e9ologue Voyageur (Paris, 1805). He made an extensive tour by foot of the Alpes in Switzerland and Central Europe studying the geology and mineralogy, and in 1808 he became an aide to Faujas. Brard was appointed director of the copper mines of Servoz in 1813 where he was the first to use anthracite coal as a fuel. In 1816, he entered into a franchise that created a glassware factory in Lardin.?He is noted for his contributions to mineralogy and also to the understanding of the stratigraphy of the Paris Basin. ?Brard\u2019s Min\u00e9ralogie appliqu\u00e9e is his major treatise on economic mineralogy. Within it he provides descriptions of the various mineral substances, the deposits, and their uses. The uses range from agricultural to gems for jewelry to ornamental architectural. The first part of the work covers the agricultural uses of minerals. The second covers minerals used as fuels. The third covers those minerals with applications to the medicines which includes \"remedies of imagination\". The fourth part covers edible minerals. In the fifth part Brard treats the architectural stones, i.e. the marbles, granites, paving stones, alabasters, serpentines and also their quarrying and shaping. The sixth part covers those minerals used in pigmentation and drawing. In the seventh part, Brard describes those minerals used in ceramics, glazing, refactories, and as abrasives or polishing agents, i.e. the diamond. The eighth and final part is devoted to the gemstones. It contains descriptions of their properties, and classes them according to value. Identification tables are provided as well as plates showing faceted stones, carved works and lapidary equipment.",

    "text": "Walking down the main street of Reims, the compact city in France\u2019s historic Champagne region, you could be forgiven for not realising its tramway even exists.\nOpened in 2011, Tramway de Reims moves passengers from place to place while barely interrupting the signature French lifestyle going on around it.\nQuiet, aesthetic trams roll gently down the Cours Jean-Baptiste Langlet, past the railway station and towards the Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Reims, where generations of French Kings were crowned. They round the bend to Rue de Vesle, which hosts the Seventeenth Century town centre, fine art galleries, boutique retail outlets, and bars where tourists sip the sparkling white wine bottled just minutes down the road.\nOf course, the tram line is not just there for tourists. At one end is the northern neighbourhood of Orgeval. At the other, the neighbourhood of Croix-Rouge and a general hospital. Between the two termini is the city centre.\nGiven a city footprint of just 47 square kilometres, Reims\u2019 population comes in at a relatively dense 221,000. The opening of a TGV high speed line between Paris and Reims in 2007 \u2013 connecting the two cities in 45 minutes \u2013 drove a transformation of Reims\u2019 economy from champagne and textiles to manufacturing, services and retail. In the five years up to 2011, 4000 new jobs were created.\nLaunching its first studies into a potential light rail line in 2003, public transport authority Reims M\u00e9tropole had several problems to solve. An extensive bus network already served more than 100,000 trips a day, and clogged the main streets, severely detracting from the historic facades lining them. A light rail network would need to be able to handle the passenger base, while providing a cleaner, better-looking alternative to buses. Most important, it needed to be financially viable.\nThe solution was to form what is commonly referred to as a public-private partnership, something rather unique to France at that time. Through a contract signed in 2006, the authority delegated the entire management, and a substantial portion of financing, for the construction and operation of a light rail line, to a private concessionary consortium.\nKnown as MARS, the private consortium consisted of Alstom Transport, to provide rollingstock, systems, infrastructure works and maintenance; Bouygues, to provide civil works, buildings, roads and pavements; engineering firm SNC-Lavalin; operator Transdev; financial advisors and lenders Natixis and Caisse d\u2019Epargne Lorraine Champagne-Ardenne; and long term investor CdC Infrastructure.\nReims M\u00e9tropole provided \u20ac174 million (A$287 million in 2006 dollars) to the MARS consortium, made up of \u20ac75 million in a grant from the city, \u20ac45 million in a grant from the state, and \u20ac54 million in a 1.8% transport tax billed to companies in the region with more than eight employees.\nThe consortium\u2019s financial partners, meanwhile, forked out \u20ac239 million (A$394 million) for the project, bringing the total value to \u20ac413 million (A$681 million).\nTransdev took over as bus network operator at the start of 2008, as part of a plan to create an integrated transport network in the city. Construction on the light rail line began in May that year. The first tram arrived in March 2010, making way for testing and commissioning of the line in September 2010.\nThe network opened commercially in April 2011, with an opening ceremony which drew thousands of spectators; locals who had come to experience their town\u2019s new asset. In 2014, the new line was put on the international stage, when the Tour de France cycle race went through Reims.\nTwo of the key consortium members in the Sydney CBD and South East Light Rail project are shared with the Reims project. Rollingstock, rail infrastructure and maintenance provider Alstom Transport is once again joined by operations specialist Transdev on the Sydney project, as part of the ALTRAC consortium.\nIt\u2019s clear that in planning its pitch as part of the consortium in Sydney, Alstom and Transdev looked to leverage their experience in Reims. An Alstom representative confirmed to Rail Express that the French manufacturer learned a lot from, and drew comparisons to its work in Reims during the bidding process for Sydney.\nLike in Reims, Alstom will install its catenary-free technology, which it calls Aesthetic Power Supply (APS), on certain sections of the Sydney network. APS features a \u2018third rail\u2019, which runs down the middle of the tramway, parallel to the main rails, providing power to the rollingstock through the ground, thus eliminating the need for overhead power.\nMore expensive to install than a traditional catenary system, APS is designed for instances like those down George Street in Sydney, and the Cours Jean-Baptiste Langlet and Rue de Vesle in Reims, where the goal is to provide a solution which complements the surrounding aesthetic, often historic architecture, the catenary-free solution is preferred.\nAlstom says its APS is currently installed on 42km of track around the globe. As a tram passes over the \u2018third rail\u2019, power is supplied to its conductive segments via coded radio dialogue between the tram and the ground. This is designed to ensure power is not supplied to uncovered sections of track.\nAPS is therefore designed to be safe in all weather situations, including rain, snow, and heat. In Reims, grass surfaces 60% of the line, and this grass is watered from ground-based sprinklers \u2013 which spray directly onto the APS power line. It is thought natural grass won\u2019t be practical in the Australian climate, so the same grass covering probably won\u2019t be seen in Sydney, but it\u2019s certainly an indication of Alstom\u2019s confidence in the safety of the APS technology.\n\u201cThe safety of the APS system has been proven through dedicated studies and confirmed by five certifying authorities,\u201d Alstom reiterates on its website.\nAside from the need for catenary-free infrastructure, the Sydney project also shares a number of logistical similarities with Reims: A main road, clogged with buses, will be closed to traffic and passenger flows will be taken up by light rail. The project will be financed through a PPP. It will link tourist sites, utilities, and living areas, with the greater transport network.\nSydney\u2019s new line will feature Alstom\u2019s Citadis X05 trams, the latest evolution of the Citadis trams which already feature in Reims. Like in Reims \u2013 where Alstom\u2019s designers created a suitable \u2018champagne flute\u2019 shaped front for the rollingstock \u2013 Sydney will receive its own unique outer design, as specified by Transport for NSW.\nThe use of a global network of projects and experience, combined with a localised approach, is key to Alstom\u2019s business strategy, according to the company\u2019s new chief executive officer, Henri Poupart-Lafarge.\nPoupart-Lafarge joined Alstom as in 1998. In 2004, when he was 35, he became chief financial officer. He moved to the role of president of Alstom Transport in 2011. With the \u2018other half\u2019 of Alstom, its Power Generation and Grid business, now sold to General Electric, Poupart-Lafarge will has taken up the role of chief executive of Alstom Group.\nRail Express spoke with Poupart-Lafarge, then in charge of Alstom Transport, in June at the UITP World Congress and Exhibition in Milan, Italy.\nAs is demonstrated through the Sydney light rail project, he said Alstom was focused on providing localised solutions to transport projects, based on the company\u2019s globally-successful, tried and tested range of products.\n\u201cThe winning formula \u2013 if you can manage it \u2013 in transport, is to try to combine localisation \u2026 with engineering products and solutions,\u201d he told Rail Express. \u201cWe need solutions which are tailor-made for the customer.\nProximity, he pointed out, is also important at times for political reasons: \u201cA number of countries are asking for some kind of localisation,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cBut at the same time, for example, our product for a metro, is a metro. So our product in Sydney [Metro] will be similar to our metros elsewhere in the world. You want to pursue a common technological platform, and common processes, so the way to manufacture is similar in one place to another.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the formula: to be close to the customer, to answer to their needs, but at the same time, to benefit from the global coverage, through a common technological platform, common processes, and a common supply chain. That\u2019s what we try to pursue.\nThe 46-year-old, who studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), replaced former Alstom CEO Patrick Kron when the sale of Alstom\u2019s energy business to GE was finalised at the end of 2015.\nPoupart-Lafarge said the new Alstom will be able to provide a more focused solution for the transport sector. He said the sale of the non-transport business units would benefit Alstom \u201cin two ways\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThe first way is, I strongly believe by being re-focused on transport, by having all Alstom around the same type of activity, same markets, same world, same jargon, it will create much more cohesion, dynamism and momentum in the company, and people are waiting for that. It will simplify our processes, and make us much more agile.\nPoupart-Lafarge is interested in the urban sector in Australia.\n\u201c[South East Asia and Australasia] is a booming region,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia, as you know, has a number of projects going on, particularly in the urban area.\nOliver Probert visited the Reims tramway courtesy of Alstom Group.\nThis article originally appeared in the AusRAIL 2015 print edition of Rail Express.

    "text": "Beginning Aug. 17, 2017, non-collecting retailers, referrers, and retail sale facilitators that make or facilitate Rhode Island sales must either register and collect sales and use tax, or comply with new notice and reporting requirements.\nThe Rhode Island Legislature recognizes that states are prohibited from imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce. Under Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), a state can only impose a tax collection obligation on a business that has a substantial connection with that state (nexus), defined as a physical presence.\nFurthermore, the internet now permits out-of-state businesses to have a substantial connection with a remote state through the use of in-state software such as cached software (\u201ccookies\u201d) or \u201cother data tracking tools.\u201d In layman\u2019s terms, internet cookies are what enables a business to recognize and track the preferences of people who browse and shop online.\nMassachusetts was the first state to base physical presence on a business\u2019s use of web cookies, though its policy was revoked after being challenged on procedural grounds. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is now working on new regulation. Ohio then enacted a tax on remote vendors that use internet cookies; it, too, is being challenged.\nNow Rhode Island\u2019s Non-Collecting Retailers, Referrers, and Retail Sale Facilitators Act (Chapter 18.2 of House Bill 5175) maintains that the use of \u201cin-state software on the devices of in-state customers constitutes physical presence,\u201d if not in the traditional sense. Therefore, businesses that use such methods to establish and maintain a market in Rhode Island are considered to have nexus with the state as of Aug. 17, provided they meet one of two sales thresholds.\nMade 200 or more transactions of taxable goods or services (including prewritten computer software delivered electronically or by load and leave) delivered in Rhode Island.\nThe measure defines and imposes requirements on noncollecting retailers, referrers, and sales facilitators in great detail, summarized below.\nStarting Aug. 17, once a referrer cumulatively receives more than $10,000 from commissions, fees, or other compensation, it must comply with a new notification requirement. Within 30 days of meeting that threshold, the referrer must notify retailers that their sales may be subject to Rhode Island sales and use tax.\nAdditional information about the Non-collecting Retailers, Referrers, and Retail Sale Facilitators Act is available from the Rhode Island Division of Taxation (See 2017 Tax Notices 03-10) and the text of RI H5175.\nRhode Island is not unique in upping efforts to collect tax from remote internet sellers. Like The Ocean State, Minnesota and Washington have both enacted laws that impose tax or notification and reporting requirements on marketplace sellers. It is getting increasingly risky for non-collecting retailers to not collect and remit tax in all states where they sell.\nYet, if a growing number of states are cracking down on non-collecting out-of-state sellers, some are also offering an olive branch in the form of tax amnesty or voluntary disclosure programs.\nBy coincidence, Aug. 17 also marks the start of a combined sales/use and income/franchise tax amnesty program for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and other marketplace providers. This is not to be confused with the tax amnesty program Rhode Island is offering Dec. 1, 2017, through Feb. 15, 2018.\nBetween Aug. 17 and Oct. 17, unregistered marketplace sellers whose sole connection to a participating state is through inventory stored in a marketplace provider\u2019s warehouse or fulfillment center are invited to apply to the Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative. In exchange for registering with a state or states and collecting and remitting sales tax from Dec. 1, 2017 forward, participating states will forgive some or all back taxes, and waive all or a portion of the penalties and interest owed.\nWashington D.C. will consider a shorter look-back period than its typical three years for both sales/use and income/franchise tax.\nWisconsin will require businesses to remit unpaid sales/use and income/franchise tax plus interest going back to Jan. 1, 2015.but will forgive taxes dating from before that date.\nA handful of other states have expressed interest in the amnesty program. A definitive list of participating states is expected by Aug. 14. See The FBA sales tax amnesty program explained for additional information.\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in the world of sales tax right now, especially for companies with actual or potential tax obligations in multiple states. Tax automation software can facilitate compliance and help businesses navigate this complex world. Learn more.",

    "text": "Luke Jacobs Synthpop, New Wave Andreas Gregor and Dave Rout have a long history in the Canadian electronic music scene that stems back deep into the 1980's with the cult electro new wavers Techniques Berlin. Much of Techniques Berlin's work has found refuge in old collections in the form of two anthology CDs simply titled 'Back Issue Vol. 1' and 'Back Issue Vol. 2' on the band's own label Bombshelter. If you were really on top of your TB game, you purchased the super limited edition compilation 'Suburban Playgrounds And Concrete Beaches' vinyl LP (300 copies) 6 years ago on Fabrika Records. Of course everything has been long sold out due to the never waning interest in Techniques Berlin. Due to that interest we arrive at this double LP comprised of new material and alternate versions of some of the classics. Later on, a companion double CD will be released by Nadanna with plenty of treats in store.\nFor those of us that grew up in the 1980's we saw the genesis of the home computer and some of the amazing things it could do as well as how it changed our culture and the way we think. I was fortunate that my father was heavily into the computer revolution. We had word processing, modems, games etc. when most of my friends did not have a home computer. The VIC 20, Commodore 64 and later the Leading Edge desktop helped define my love for all the offerings the computers had. Techniques Berlin wrote songs that reflected that era. 'Cyber Threat', 'Love Via Computer', Machine Language', 'Transmission' and 'Metropolis' are testaments to that time with their amazing arrangements and danceable progressions. These tracks and others take me back to those exploratory times of my teenage years as I shaped my path to today.\nAs you indulge in Techniques Berlin's new double LP 'Breathing' on Nadanna Records you feel a sense of revelry. Everything sounds so much within the era the original material was released, i'm afraid to call it new material. \"Deep End\" opens as if it was the A side to a 12\" released 1986. The fast-paced beat with the addicting melodies and transitions to the chorus are top notch making this a choice entry to kick off this highly anticipated return to brilliance for Techniques Berlin. \"Cold War\" rings in more 80's vibes with backing vocals/spoken piece done by Tracy Howe of Rational Youth. Although the song is 5 minutes long, the repetitive nature of the track makes it seem longer. It definitely has hints of Rational Youth's classic track \"Dancing On The Berlin Wall\" as well as sharing Rational Youth's title of their finest work to date 'Cold War Night Life' as the chorus. The original theme of \"Cold War\" centered around dating and how much easier it was with the threat of nuclear annihilation in the cold war era. With the original working title \"Cold War Love Life\", Andreas and Dave thought it was too similar to the Rational Youth title. Andreas sent the track to Tracy Howe to see his thoughts on it, and he liked it. Tracy ended up joining Techniques Berlin on stage in Montreal and this is how he ended up recording on this song. \"Serendipity\" and \"Damage\" continue the new material as if these tracks were lost in the TB vaults and just found. The beautiful synth rhythms flourish in the vast technical display of pure awesomeness paired with perfect melodies and well timed drops. \"Damage\" also displays more of that 80's retro sound. I like the short vocal verses and the time in between the next vocal piece sets up the crafty nature of the track. \"Damage\" laces some killer sparkling keys set to mid-pace beats that will surely captivate the most discerning electronic aficionado. Techniques Berlin show their fans that this is not just some cheap come-back gimmick to generate relevance. Every track is well-designed with ample time taken to ensure the best product possible. \"Burning Down\" sinks the tempo to a less moderate pace. The vocals seem to take a more dominate role this time. Midway through the track there is a nice long instrumental surge between the next vocal piece showcasing brilliant electronic arrangements. \"Hollow Graphic Haze\" reveals Dina Naskos' backing vocals set to somewhat spoken style vocals leaving the more melodic style behind. This is similar to the \"Cold War\" vocal style. The diversity in the vocal style really helps keep the overall feel to 'Breathing' fresh and vibrant in nature. \"Driving Force\" and \"Changes\" solidify the structural integrity of 'Breathing' by holding the midway point on stable ground. Once again, there are no filler tracks, just top notch programming and arrangements throughout. \"Changes\" seem to revolve around a lost romance, thinking about another dance with the lost love. The lyrics reminded of Nadanna's logo of the dancing couple. \"Driving force\" keeps the album flowing in a great direction. If you listen carefully somewhere after the two minute mark, there is an echoing distant sound that reminds me of indoor racket ball. I guess you will have take my word for it or listen and decide for yourself. I love the choices of sounds. I'm sure this was not what Techniques Berlin had in mind, but meshed together with everything else it works brilliantly to keep strength of the album up. \"Breathing\" marks the end of the new tracks along with \"Salvation\". 'Breathing\" is definitely a stand out offering. With its quick beat and perfectly executed monotone yet melodic choruses makes this a super enticing concluding routine to the album that shares the song's title. With the 20 plus synths Andreas and Dave have between them there's always a way to elevate their game. They certainly did that on each of the 10 new songs.\n\"Picture Show\" was written in 86 or 87 as a tribute to the Canadian musician Nash The Slash. Nash The Slash used to play live in old theaters to provide sound for silent movies. His signature look was a tuxedo, tophat, sunglasses and his face wrapped in bandages. The band was fond of his work and got to know him. After his passing in 2014, Techniques Berlin decided to re-record \"Picture Show\" as tribute to him and his work. \"Picture Show\" features an aggressive instrumental build paired with some piercing synth work making this track a perfect tribute to a musical icon. Most of the tracks after \"Picture Show\" will be familiar to long time fans of the band. Although these tracks may be alternate versions or rehearsal versions, they are still just as cool as the original versions. \"Watching You\", \"Beats Like A Machine\", \"Planet 21\", \"Miles Away\", \"Pieces Of Glass\", \"Just One Look\", \"Where Have You Been\" and \"Metropolis\" can all be found on iTunes in the digital format in the original versions. The somber sounding \"Sudden Guilt\" has never been released previously. \"Miles Away\" has a familiar title to fans of John Foxx. The reference was unintentional and is not a cover version. Andreas' love of John Foxx can be found more easily on his Agents In Fared project. \"Miles Away\" is remastered from a chewed up four-track cassette. The track came to be when Dave played the demo version for Andreas. Andreas promptly pulled into a 7-11 parking lot, purchased a notebook and began coming up with lyrics to compliment the music. He ended up writing about a girl he knew in college. \"Metropolis\" is the end result of a ten year process to get Dina to act as a replacement for Dale Hanlin after his short tenure from 1990-1992. Dina, Dave and Andreas played \"Metropolis\" in a rehearsal session and loved the outcome and decided to record it.\nNadanna and Techniques Berlin collaborated to introduce new material and alternate versions of early works because they heard the distant calling and local callings for new material from a band the fans will never let die. Andreas and Dave heard their calls and made a comeback album new fans and long time fans will appreciate. Given Nadanna's track record with remix CDs, you know when it is finally released sometime in the spring you will hear some incredible stuff.\nDave and Andreas both worked with Digital Poodle adding percussion and drum programming in the mid 90's. 12 years ago Das Drehmoment released Datafreq 'Fun For The Whole Family' album in 2006 showcasing the duo's vivacity and abilities to perform some killer addictive electro synthpop with some minimal influences. There was and is some amazing music that came out Canada that wasn't Front Line Assemble or Skinny Puppy. Do yourself a solid and explore Dave and Andreas' works. They certainly earned a spot in Canadian music history through their music and the influences they have had on others.\nOf course Martin Bowes is responsible for the mastering and Steve Lippert took care of the cover art. The record is limited to 350 copies, gatefold sleeve and inner sleeve with lyrics and credits.\nLP1 Credits: all words by Andreas Gregor except \"Driving Force\" by Dave Rout.\nAll music by Techniques Berlin.\nAndreas Gregor and Dave Rout have a long history in the Canadian electronic music scene that stems back deep into the 1980's with the cult electro new wavers Techniques Berlin. Much of Techniques Berlin's work has found refuge in old collections in the form of two anthology CDs simply titled 'Back Issue Vol. 1' and 'Back Issue Vol. 2' on the band's own label Bombshelter. If you were really on top of your TB game, you purchased the super limited edition compilation 'Suburban Playgrounds And Concrete Beaches' vinyl LP (300 copies) 6 years ago on Fabrika Records. Of course everything has been long sold out due to the never waning interest in Techniques Berlin. Due to that interest we arrive at this double LP comprised of new material and alternate versions of some of the classics. Later on, a companion double CD will be released by Nadanna with plenty of treats in store.",

    "text": "This file discusses briefly (1) the four dimensions underlying the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and (2) several teaching approaches that will appeal to different MBTI profiles.\nThe 126 item Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Form G, is the most reliable method for assessing student learning style. The MBTI provides data on four sets of preferences. These preferences result in 16 learning styles, or types. A type is the combination of the four preferences. The most common MBTI type for business undergraduates is the ESTJ, the Extraverted-Sensing-Thinking-Judger.\nThe MBTI instrument should be administered in the first or second class period by the counseling center at your school. It takes about 45 minutes to complete the instrument. The counseling center can score the MBTI and share the data with the students. Students enjoy learning about themselves and find the MBTI data informative.\nThis preference tells us how people \"charge their batteries.\" Introverts find energy in the inner world of ideas, concepts, and abstractions. They can be sociable but need quiet to recharge their batteries. Introverts want to understand the world. Introverts are concentrators and reflective thinkers. Their motto is: Ready, Aim, Aim, ..... For the introvert, there is no impression without reflection.\nExtraverts find energy in things and people. They prefer interaction with others, and are action oriented. Extraverts are interactors and \"on-the-fly\" thinkers. Their motto is: Ready, Fire, Aim. For the extravert, there is no impression without expression.\nThe majority of undergraduate students are extraverts. Based on data from the Center for Applied Psychological Type (CAPT) between 56% and 58% of over 16,000 freshman students at three state universities were extraverts. Interestingly, over 83% of college student leaders were extraverts, while over 65% of Phi Beta Kappas were introverts. Our own data base indicates that over 65% of business students are extraverts. It is not surprising that almost two-thirds of undergraduate business students are extraverts. Students may major in business administration because the business world appreciates and rewards action which coincides with the extraverts' strength.\nThe majority of university faculty are introverts. CAPT reported that almost 55% of 2,282 faculty are introverts. Our own data base for business faculty indicates that over 60% are introverts..\nExtraverted students learn by explaining to others. They do not know if they understand the subject until they try to explain it to themselves or others. Extraverted students have told us that they thought they knew the material until they tried to explain it to a fellow student. Only then did they realize they did not understand the subject.\nBoth support learning through explaining, but provide quiet time for introverted students.\nTeacher poses question and provides quiet time for students.\nTeacher designates the explainer and listener within each dyad.\nTeachers pose question and provide quiet time for students.\nEach team member shares ideas with others in a round-robin fashion.\nTeams discusses ideas and reaches closure.\nTeacher critiques some team's answers and provide closure.\nIn a seminal study, George Miller noted that people can hold 7 + 2 chunks of knowledge in their minds at any given time. If each knowledge chunk contains a specific fact, then the amount of knowledge possessed is limited. But if each chunk contains many interconnected facts, a network or framework of facts, then the amount of knowledge is almost unlimited.\nIntroverted students want to develop frameworks that integrate or connect the subject matter. To an introvert, disconnected chunks are not knowledge, merely information. Knowledge means interconnecting material and seeing the \"big picture.\"\nFaculty should teach their students how to chunk, or group and interconnect, knowledge. Introverted students will appreciate it, extraverted students may not. Nevertheless, cognitive psychologists tell us that through chunking, students master the material. We recommend that faculty teach students how to build a compare/ contrast table, flowchart, or concept map.\nSome of us choose to rely on our five senses. Some prefer taking in information through our \"sixth\" sense. Sensing people are detail oriented, want facts, and trust them. Joe Friday from the TV show Dragnet epitomizes the extreme sensing detective. All he ever wanted was \"just the facts\".\nIntuitive people seek out patterns and relationships among the facts they have gathered. They trust hunches and their intuition and look for the \"big picture.\" The quintessential intuitive was Albert Einstein whose fanciful thought experiments revolutionized the 20th century. He could see patterns where others saw randomness or chaos.\nThe majority of undergraduates are sensing students. Based on data from the Center for Applied Psychological Type (CAPT) between 56% and 72% of over 16,000 freshmen at three state universities were sensing students. Interestingly, almost 83% of national merit scholarship finalists and 92% of Rhodes Scholars were intuitive students. Our own data base indicates that over 65% of business majors are sensing students.\nThe majority of university faculty are intuitive. CAPT reported that almost 64% of 2,282 faculty are intuitive. We obtained the same percentage from our business faculty data base.\n-application organizing strategy and (3) the advance organizer.\nIn the what must be known (WMBK) method, we first ask: What is (are) the topic's most essential general principle(s) or goals? Place the answer in a goal box. We then ask: What topic(s) must be known such that students could achieve the goal? Place these subgoal boxes below the goal box and show an arrow leading from each subgoal box to the goal box. Continue to ask WMBK questions until you interface with material previously covered. You would then present the lecture by starting at the bottom of the diagram and work up towards the goal box.\nThe A-T-A method begins with a faculty member presenting an (A)pplication (problem or mini-case) to the class. The students attempt to analyze and solve the case or problem without the benefit of the upcoming chapter's theory or ideas. Applications motivate sensing students to learn the material. Applications answer the question that sensing students often ask, \"why am I learning this material?\" After the class has struggled with the problem (and sometimes emerged victoriously), the teacher presents the chapter's (T)heory or ideas, and then applies it to the original application. Afterwards the teacher presents additional (A)pplications and has the students apply the theory.\nAn opening application problem or mini-case should (1) be familiar to students, (2) engage their curiosity, (3) be almost solvable from previous text material or student experiences, and (4) be baffling, or counter-intuitive, if possible. A familiar problem assures sensing students that their experiences have prepared them to address the problem. The third attribute minimizes students' frustrations. The application should be \"just beyond a student's reach\". However, previously learned material or experiences should help students make a reasonable solution attempt. An application that is too significant a leap will cause frustration, and the feeling that the teacher is playing games with the students.\nDavid Ausubel's advance organizer is a brief lecture or demonstration during the introduction of the lecture that provides a mental scaffolding to anchor the new material. The advance organizer provides a set of highly general concepts that subsume the material about to be learned. An advance organizer taps into students' existing knowledge structures. It helps cross-list new information with already existing information and thus aids learning and knowledge retrieval. It makes the unfamiliar more familiar; it makes the abstract more concrete.\nNote how the following advance organizer taps into existing knowledge that the students should have already acquired.\nGoal:-----------Connects Indian history to an existing civil rights knowledge base.\nThe advance organizer is not an overview. An overview would have introduced the students to the lecture's key ideas: Gandhi, salt monopoly, British policy, boiling sea water, etc..\nThe advance organizer provides a familiar setting to anchor new, and potentially strange, material. The organizer works because at a very general level, the marches of King and Gandhi dealt with charismatic leaders in a struggle against oppressive forces. For an African-American audience, the MLK organizer transformed an abstract lecture into a familiar and more concrete setting.\n1. What do students know that at a very general level is similar to the subject matter about to be taught?\n2. How can I demonstrate the connections between what is known and what is to be learned?\nIntuitive students prefer either the traditional Theory-Application-Theory approach or the A-T-A approach using discovery learning. We illustrate the A-T-A approach using discovery learning in teaching the central limit theorem in a basic statistics course. The teacher selects 50 numbers from a random numbers table, and develops a frequency histogram. The data are not bell-shaped. The teacher then selects 30 samples of size eight numbers (replacing each number after it is drawn) from the 50 numbers, computes the 30 means, and develops a frequency histogram for the means. The histogram is now roughly bell-shaped. The teacher concludes the demonstration by asking why is the histogram of means nearly bell-shaped. Using the discovery method, students hopefully will discover the reasons underlying the central limit theorem.\nThe discovery method, or the why method, will appeal to intuitive students and will teach sensing students how to uncover general principles. In using this method, sensing and intuitive students should be combined in learning groups. The intuitive student can help the sensing student to discover the theory; the sensing student can help identify and marshal the facts of the exercise.\nIntuitive students must have the big picture, or an integrating framework, to understand a subject. The big picture shows how the subject matter is interrelated. Intuitive students can develop reasonably correct concept maps or compare and contrast tables. Fortunately, sensing students can be taught to do the same.\nSome of us choose to decide things impersonally on analysis, logic, and principle. Some of us make decisions by focusing on human values. Thinking students value fairness. What could be fairer than focusing on the situation's logic, and placing great weight on objective criteria in making a decision. Mr. Spock, science officer of the starship Enterprise, had an extreme preference for thinking.\nFeeling students value harmony. They focus on human values and needs as they make decisions or arrive at judgments. They tend to be good at persuasion and facilitating differences among group members. Dr. McCoy, Spock's colleague aboard the Enterprise, demonstrated a preference for feeling.\nUnlike the two previous sets of preferences, CAPT reports that on this dimension, the proportion of males and females differ. About 64% of all males have a preference for thinking, while only about 34% of all females have a preference for thinking.\nOur own data base indicates that over 70% of male and female under-graduate business students are thinking students. It is not surprising that the majority of business majors are thinking students. Business is, after all, the domain of logic and analysis.\nThe majority of university faculty have a preference for thinking. CAPT reported that almost 54% of 2,282 faculty are thinking. Seventy percent of business faculty have a preference for thinking. Thus, on the thinking versus feeling preference, business faculty and students are similar.\nThinking students like clear course and topic objectives. Clear course or topic objectives avoid vague words or expressions such as \"students will appreciate or be exposed to.\" Rather, objectives are precise and action-oriented. By precise we mean that teachers can write objectives at three meta-levels of learning: rote, meaningful and integrated, and critical thinking. By action oriented we mean that the verbs describe what students must do, not what faculty will do. The Bloom et al. taxonomy provides guidelines for writing clear and meaningful objectives.\n1. Make process suggestions to regain session focus.\n2. Keep individuals from personally attacking one another.\n3. Monitor time remaining within a session and gently remind members.\n4. Encourage equal participation among members in discussion phase.\n5. Demonstrate collaborative-seeking (WIN-WIN) behaviors.\n6. Assure that recorder writes legibly.\n7. Respond to group member's questions to you by restating the question and asking other group members to respond (the boomerang method).\n8. Recognize that all the objectives and goals within a session may not completed. Get group to do the possible given the time constraints.\n9. Use light-hearted (or self-deprecating) humor to break tension.\n10. Keep group enthusiasm high and sell ideas to members.\nSome of us like to postpone action and seek more data. Others like to make quick decisions. Judging people are decisive, planful and selfregimented. They focus on completing the task, only want to know the essentials, and take action quickly (perhaps too quickly). They plan their work and work their plan. Deadlines are sacred. Their motto is: just do it!\nPerceptive people are curious, adaptable, and spontaneous. They start many tasks, want to know everything about each task, and often find it difficult to complete a task. Deadlines are meant to be stretched. Their motto is: on the other hand ... .\nThe majority of undergraduate students are judging students. Based on data from the Center for Applied Psychological Type (CAPT) between 46% and 60% of over 16,000 freshmen at three state universities were judging students. Interestingly, almost 64% of Rhodes Scholars were perceptive students. Our own data base indicates that over 70% of undergraduate business students are judging students.\nThe majority of university faculty also have a preference for judging. CAPT reported that almost 65% of 2,282 faculty prefer judging. We obtained the same percentage from our business faculty data base.\nWe have found that the following hints on note taking and test taking help judging students learn more effectively.\nMost students can learn speedwriting in several minutes. Just omit all (or most) vowels. Or develop your own shorthand method. For example, mst stdnts cn lrn spdwrtng in svrl mnts. Jst omt ll or mst vwls.\nDraw a line down center of a notebook page. On the left-hand side, record the lecture (use speedwriting or your own shorthand notation). After class, write a commentary on the right-hand side. Include restating ideas in your own words, finding sources of confusion, identifying key points, looking for links to earlier learned material, and asking what does this mean to me (the student).\nUse different colors to record ideas presented in class and found in the text or readings. For example, use blue to code major ideas and green to code links to previously learned material.\nIn answering an essay question, first Analyze the question and jot down key ideas, Organize the ideas into a logical sequence, and only then write the essay (Respond).\nTo review an essay question, first read your answer. Then construct a essay question based on your answer. Now compare your question to the teacher's question. If different, revise your answer. This strategy ensures that students answer the teacher's question.\nRead the question's stem (the portion that contains the question) and write a brief answer. Then compare your answer to the four or five choices, and select the answer most similar to your mini-essay.\nYour universities' learning resource center is an especially good source for additional hints on note and test taking. Include several hints in each course syllabus. Spend a few minutes explaining these hints in the first class period. Occasionally remind the students of the hints (especially before the first exam).\nJudging students often reach too-quick closure when analyzing cases. Thus we recommend a second-look meeting. After completing the case, the group reviews their analysis. A student plays a \"gentle\" Devil's Advocate (DA) and challenges the group's conclusions. The DA should be prepared to recommend an alternative solution. This will force the group to consider the pros and cons of both approaches. The DA can also ask team members to state assumptions about stakeholders (those who are affected by or will affect the case solution) which must be true for the group's solution to be effective. The DA can then challenge the group to provide evidence that the assumptions are true. Guidelines for a second-look meeting should be included in the case preparation hints provided to students.\nPerceptive students often postpone doing an assignment until the very last minute. They are not lazy. Quite to the contrary, they seek information to the very last minute (and sometimes beyond). We recommend decomposing a complex project or paper into a series of sub-assignments and providing deadlines for each sub-assignment. The deadlines may keep the perceptive students on target.\nDecomposing a major project into sub-assignments provides the opportunity for continuous feedback to the student. Have students hand-in an audio tape with their sub-assignments. The teacher can then provide detailed audio (we speak faster than we can write) comments on content and grammar. When we have used the audio feedback approach, final papers are clear and readable, and thus less aggravation to read. Moreover, without the teacher's interim feedback, students lose an opportunity to improve their writing skills during the semester.\nThe MBTI instrument is available from Consulting Psychological Press in Palo Alto, California.\nPercentage data taken from Isabel Briggs Myers and Mary McCaulley, Manual: A Guide to the Development and Use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Consulting Psychologist Press, 1985.\nGeorge Miller, \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,\" Psychological Review, April 1956, pp.81-97.\nDavid Ausubel, Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View.

This provides that the resolution is not effective unless notice of the intention to move it has been given to the company a least 28 days before the meeting at which it is moved. The company must then give notice of the resolution at the same time and in the same manner as it gives notice of the meeting (or, if that is not practicable, must advertise in an appropriate newspaper).\n(b) if the poll is so demanded on a resolution to delete or amend the provisions of this article, to  votes for each share held by her/him.\"\nNote that this clause can only a protect a director who is also a shareholder in the company, and the above wording will have to be modified to meet the circumstances of each case.\n(e) he shall for more than six consecutive months have been absent without permission of the directors from meetings of the directors held during that period and the directors resolve that his office be vacated.\nOther grounds could be added to the articles and/or provisions inserted to make it easier to remove a director.\nA court may make a disqualification order prohibiting the person from acting as a director of a company, or being involved in the management of any company, for the period of the disqualification. Such orders are made under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.\nThe provisions of that Act were amended by Part 9 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. Sec104 of that Act inserts a new sec5A into the CDDA making convictions abroad a ground for disqualification and sec105 inserts a new sec8ZA CDDA making it possible for someone who has had sufficient influence over another person who is themselves disqualified (\u201cthe main transgressor\u201d) also to be disqualified.\nSome detailed amendments are made to the matters to be taken into account when a court is determining unfitness to be a director. Sec 105 SBEEA amends CDDA sec6 to include conduct in relation to one or more overseas companies.\nA new CDDA Schedule 1 (matters for determining unfitness) is enacted.\nBy sec110 SBEEA a new sec15A is added to the CDDA allowing the court to make a compensation order against a person who is subject to a disqualification order or disqualification undertaking and the conduct for which the person is subject to the order or undertaking has caused loss to one or more creditors of an insolvent company of which the person has been a director.\nThere are also detailed amendments to equivalent legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nNote that if the director is removed from office as a director, this will not usually affect the director's position (if he/she has one) as a shareholder in the company. This is often a relevant consideration in private companies, where often a director is also a shareholder. In most circumstances the only solution is for there to be negotiations for the purchase of the ex-directors shares. In some circumstances, the removal of the director may be grounds for petition under CA 2006, sec994 (the unfairly prejudicial conduct provision) under which the court may order the remaining shareholders (or indeed, The Company itself) to buy the ex-directors shares. Some companies' articles contain a clause that a shareholder who ceases to be a director is deemed to have given the company a transfer notice in respect of his or her shares, so that the shares can, in effect, be compulsorily acquired.",

    "text": "BRATTLEBORO\u2014The team behind the three-station police-fire facilities upgrades project estimates it has found $400,000 in savings.\nThe town Police-Fire Facilities Building Committee hosted a meeting last week to give the public an opportunity to ask questions about the $14.1 million project. About 20 people attended the presentation in the Selectboard Meeting Room at the Municipal Center on Feb. 27.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been your watchdog on the budget up to date,\u201d said Steve Horton, project manager on incorporating the oversight committee and town\u2019s input.\n\u201cThe priority being the best value for the money and the outcome being the safety and security for the people of Brattleboro,\u201d he said about the scrutinizing the project budget.\nControversy has accompanied the police-fire facilities upgrade project. Bonding for the project has been blamed for a jump in the town\u2019s property taxes for fiscal year 2015.\nThe town\u2019s police station and two fire stations, however, have significant health and safety issues: black mold in the West Brattleboro fire station, and in the police station, which is in the Municipal Center.\nModern fire engines are too heavy for the floor and too big for the doors of the Central Fire Station, which also has air-quality issues.\nThe damp of the police station\u2019s basement damages records.\nThe two largest cost savings have come through changes to the West Brattleboro fire station and police station plans.\nThe project team has recommended building a new West Brattleboro station, rather than renovating the existing station.\nThe project team also decided to build the Police Station addition to the Municipal Center without a basement, said Raymond A. Giolitto, architect with Northeast Collaborative Architects, which is based in Connecticut and Rhode Island.\nThe new Station 2 will be constructed on property adjacent to the existing West Brattleboro fire station. The existing station is undersized, and renovating and expanding it would have required the costly relocation of a sewer tank and emergency generators.\nAccording to Giolitto and Horton, the oversight committee has not decided whether to demolish the outdated West Brattleboro station or to put the building to new use. The exiting station will continue to house firefighters during construction.\nBuilding a new Station 2 will save the project about $200,000.\nNancy Miller questioned whether having a station in West Brattleboro was prudent given the town\u2019s tight finances.\n\u201cI have serious reservations whether we can afford all three sites,\u201d said Miller.\nHorton answered that before construction starts, the town will obtain from the contractor a guaranteed maximum price to help keep the project within budget.\nEarly plans for the Police Department renovations included renovations and expansion of the existing stone foundation of Municipal Center to the tune of $150,000 to $200,000, explained Horton.\n\u201cPeople think basements are cheap, but they\u2019re not,\u201d said Horton.\nPhillips told the audience that the committee charged Interim Town Manager Patrick Moreland and Horton with evaluating alternative sites for the police station.\nAll the alternative sites proved more expensive than keeping the police station at the Municipal Center, said Phillips.\nGiolitto and Horton also took questions on how the police station addition will affect the Municipal Center\u2019s parking lot.\nThe town anticipates approximately 40 parking spaces, said Giolitto. The parking lot will also become one-way from Grove Street to Main Street for everything but police vehicles.\nHorton told the audience that construction on all three building sites will occur simultaneously. The project team anticipates starting construction this summer. Of the three, the West Brattleboro station has the shortest construction schedule and will likely be completed this year. Central Station should be completed by the summer of 2015. The police station project has the longest timeline and should be completed the end of 2015.\nThe oversight committee has approved the plans for the three stations and will recommend the Selectboard approve the plans.\nOriginally published in The Commons issue #244 (Wednesday, March 5, 2014).

    "text": "Layered coconut yogurt and berry chia pots must be one of the prettiest things you could ever make. And so easy! The biggest challenge is knowing when to have one! For breakfast or dessert? Or \u2013 even better \u2013 pop the pudding into a jar and take it to work for lunch!\nI used this easy homemade coconut yogurt but it would be just as delicious made with traditional cow's milk yogurt, goat milk yogurt or any other alternative yogurt you fancy. Why not try almond milk yogurt? There are no strict rules with chia puddings - substitute to suit your dietary preferences. This recipe is failsafe!\nWhen I soak chia, I aim to sponge up as much lacto fermented probiotic goodness as possible. Consider adding the watery (whey) content that separates from yogurt instead of milk? In this case, I added the coconut water under my coconut cream yogurt instead of coconut milk. It is too good to discard!\nNo time for layers? You can skip the layers and make one pink pot instead. It will taste the same.\n1. Combine the yoghurt, coconut milk, chia seeds, vanilla and honey (or maple) in a bowl and stir to combine well.\n2. Place the chia mixture in the fridge for anywhere between 1 hour and overnight. The chia seeds will expand and become soft and gelatinous.\n3. If using frozen berries, allow the berries to defrost then blend with the cinnamon to form a smooth berry pur\u00e9e.\n4. Divide the chia pudding mixture into 3 small bowls.\n5. Add 1/3 of the berry pur\u00e9e to one bowl of chia pudding and stir to combine. Add the remaining two-thirds to the second bowl and keep one bowl a la natural.\n6. Spoon layers of chia pudding into 2 jars.\nEnjoy immediately or keep in the fridge for up to a week.",

    "text": "2. Introduction Jaguar is a brand of Jaguar Land Rover which is owned by the Indian company Tata Motors since 2008. Jaguar's business was founded under the name of Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing bodies for passenger cars. Under S. S. Cars Limited, the business was extended to complete cars. S. S. Cars was renamed as \"Jaguar\" in 1945. It merged with British Motor Corporation in 1966,and then in 1968 it merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975.Jaguar was de-merged from British Leyland and then was acquired by Ford in 1990. Jaguar has, in recent years, manufactured cars for the British Prime Minister. Jaguar cars today are designed in Jaguar Land Rover's engineering centres located at Coventry and Warwickshire, and are manufactured in Birmingham, The Company today employs over 10,000 employees. Segmentation, targeting and positioning strategies of the brand in the Indian market Jaguar has always been in a leading position.It continues to occupy in spite of occasionalbudget constraints,the position of being a product that provides ultimate customer satisfaction. The primary marketing objective of Jaguar has been to strengthen its brand equity and achieve retailing mileage out of that. Market segmentation involves dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers, or countries who have, or are perceived to have, common needs, interests, and priorities. Targeting refers to choosing only those segments which seem attractive to the company and the company has the capability to serve. Jaguar uses the following bases for segmenting the consumer market and has targeted these segments effectively by aiming at what customer from each of these segments look for. 1. Demographic Segmentation : Demographic segmentation divides the markets based on variables such as age, gender, family size, income, occupation, education, race and nationality. Jaguar has done this segmentation based on factor such as age, gender and income. Targeting: \uf0e0Jaguar came out with Jaguar S-type which was targeted at the younger customer base. \uf0e0The XE sports Sedan had a dual target, theyouth and women. \uf0e0Jaguar\u2019s XFR, XJL Super sport and XKR-S models are basically targeted at confident, well-educated and intelligent individual who create businesses,technologies and lifestyles that have an impact on our culture. \uf0e0 The Jaguar XF series targeted the luxury car market (> Rs. 25 lakhs). This was for the high net worth individuals in India. Based on age, Jaguar has targeted the following groups, viz.\n3. \uf0e0Successful professionals in the age group of 30-45 (singles and couples) \uf0e0Executive families in the 40-50 age range (2+ children) \uf0e0Aged individuals (couples aged above 50). 2. Psychographic Segmentation : Psychographic segmentation is done based on lifestyle and personality traits. Targeting: \uf0e0With commercials like \u201cCaptured: Jaguar at play\u201d, Jaguar tried to attract the confident, powerful, independent individuals who love dynamism. The commercial used three of Jaguars sports cars, viz. Jaguar\u2019s XFR, XJL Super sport and XKR-S models to inflict upon the viewers a sense of power and exhilaration when they sit behind the wheels. \uf0e0 Jaguar\u2019s luxury car range are targeted at those consumers who are successful,aristocrat and have a status and lifestyle to maintain. Brand Positioning Positioning is a strategy that aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to the other competing brands in customer\u2019s minds. The positioning strategy of Jaguar needs it to differentiate itself from its direct competitors, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes in terms of performance, dependability and styling. All of its competitors being in the luxury car brand range, Jaguar\u2019s Point of Parity (PoP) lies in its constant appeal to the niche market of high net worth individuals in the country and, its launch of expensive sports cars. At the same time, Jaguar has managed to brand itself as truly different fromits competitors (PoD) by positioning the brand as animate \u2013 seductive, emotional, unique, energetic and high performance \u2013 while posing the question, \u201cHow alive are you?\u201dThe \u201cAlive\u201d campaign targets luxury consumers who are contemporary, sophisticated and daring, and have a desire for authentic, independent brands. It also appeals to a more youthful audience, while not alienating its current demographic. Jaguar then launched a rebranding campaign with a new logo and a revamped brand image. In an attempt to modernize the brand and appeal to a younger demographic, Jaguar introduced some elements into its logo design that looks more 3-dimensional and introduces a chrome gradient effect.\n7. \uf0b7 The power of buyers in the luxury car industry is also quite fair. Customers have a significant amount of power, mainly due to the choice of large variety of luxury brands and product, and because of the presence of substitutes. Customers can choose from many different brands and car models, with widely differing performance, quality, appearance, pricing, additional features. This allows the customer to freely choose the product that best fits her preferences, status and lifestyle. The Internet has improved customers\u2019 access to information about the characteristics of car models, and to the experience and reviews of past users and experts. That forces premium car makers to improve continuously quality in order to not fail to meet the high expectations of customers and also to not fall behind competitors\u2019 innovations and improvements. \uf0b7 Once a customer has purchased a car, there are moderate switching costs to change to another, since the current car\u2019s value will have to be reduced when it is sold in the used car market or returned to the car dealer. Brand loyalty in the luxury car segment is higher than for lower-end cars, since customers tend to develop a closer emotional relationship between their self-image and their car and brand (provided that the expectations are being met). \uf0b7 Another favorable factor for car companies is that the size of buyers and of their individual orders are small, since most of the customers buy only one car every some years, reducing the significance of the behavior of an individual customer. \uf0b7 The presence of many substitutes to luxury cars enhances significantly the bargaining power of potential customers. Customers likely become more cost conscious and switch to less glamorous but cheaper and more efficient \u201cnormal\u201d cars and thus may choose to use any of a wide range of transportation devices instead of luxury cars. Threat of substitutes: medium-high \uf0b7 Luxury cars fulfill basically two needs for customers: provide a means of transportation, and assert the privileged status of their owner. The first need can be fulfilled by a variety of other products, such as other types of cars, motorbikes, bicycles, public transportation systems, planes. The most recognizable substitutes for the luxury cars from Jaguar are either cars rolled out by Audi, BMW and Mercedes -Benz or higher-end cars from ultra-luxury brands (Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Bentley, Lamborghini), or at the other end of the spectrum, less expensive cars from non-luxury brands (Ford, Toyota, General Motors, Fiat). \uf0b7 Higher-end brands can exert additional pressure by introducing some car models with lower-than-usual prices or special discounts to allure customers with lower incomes than their traditional customer base. At the same time, technological progress allows non-luxury car makers to include in their cars more and more of the features and amenities initially reserved to luxury cars (for instance driving-assisting systems and touch screens), forcing luxury brands to innovate at a fast pace to keep the appropriate level of differentiation and superiority. \uf0b7 Another major threat to car manufacturers\u2019 sales is the presence of the used cars markets. Premium brands of motorbikes such as Ducati and Harley-Davidson could be considered suitable substitutes for luxury cars as both a transportation device and a status symbol.\n8. Threat of new entrants: between low and medium \uf0b7 The luxury car industry is protected by significant barriers to entry and thus the threat of new entrants is relatively low. One of the most significant barriers comprises the brand equityenjoyed by most established brands. The repute of the brand is extremely important to customers; luxury brands such as Jaguar, Mercedes - Benz, BMW and Audi have a long and magnificent history to boast about, and the companies work hard to preserve the association between them and other symbols of individuality and of top-notch quality and performance. \uf0b7 Although several Asian companies have developed new luxury brands to compete with the traditional European and American brands, it is extremely difficult for challengers to match the prestige of brands with years of history. \uf0b7 Another challenging barrier to entry is the huge initial investment required to enter car markets in general. Large amounts of capital are required to set up manufacturing facilities and invest in R&D, among other large expenses. This also creates large sunk costs and makes it hard to achieve economies of scale. The capital requirements are one of the main reasons why new luxury brands have been produced by companies which were already present in the market as large car manufacturers (Toyota\u2019s Lexus and Nissan\u2019s Infiniti) and not by new, free-standing, companies. \uf0b7 Other protective factors include the high degree of product differentiation and of competition in the industry, which make it less attractive. Competition between established firms: high \uf0b7 Competitive rivalry in the luxury car segment is extremely high as Luxury car concentration in the industry is not very high in the advanced markets, and a variety of very different brands with different origins and tactics compete. The rivalry between companies is rather intense, especially with Jaguar in the Indian market mainly due to the presence of the three global leaders: Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. These three companies compete hard to attain not only market leadership in all the major markets, but also to be recognized as the top luxury brand in customers\u2019 perception not only in India but every country across the world. The ascent of Jaguar from \u201coutsider\u201d to \u201csignificant challenger\u201d to Audi, BMW and Mercedes Benz has further contributed to make rivalry even harsher. Further to this, the competition has extended from the advanced markets to the emerging markets, where each company hopes get a privileged grip to take advantage of the future growth of middle classes. \uf0b7 Jaguar explicitly recognizes each of the three companies as competitors, and their public statements and advertising and promotional campaigns make provocative comparison between the cars as to performance and innovativeness. Technological innovation is one field of fierce competition, as each of the companies claimto be technological leader in the industry. Competition on pricing is also intensified. \uf0b7 In addition to the old competitions between market leaders, there are also challenges posed by the new luxury brands developed by the large successfulAsian car manufacturers such as Hyundai, Honda, Toyota and Nissan which are challenging the Western brands including Jaguar in their home markets by developing new brands and offering customers cars with lower prices and better fuel efficiency.\n10. consumers have changed with the shift of consumer attitude towards from affordability to quality, pleasure and design which has suddenly accelerated business in luxury car segments. \uf0b7 Motivation and perception The brand Jaguar fulfils the esteem needs and Self-actualization needs in the Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs. Jaguar\u2019s Super luxury cars have become as the status symbol and a matter of esteem. Consumers of jaguar like to flaunt their cars as their prized possession. The frequent use of jaguar cars stimulates the perception of an \u201cultra luxury life\u201d the consumers gain from their possession. Jaguar\u2018s \u201cunique driving experience\u201d is one of the consumer\u2019s motivation factor. A Brand Awareness consumer centric campaign ALIVE was launched to tap on the Indian luxury car segments. The Brand awareness of jaguar was low when it came to India. So, company decided to launch a consumer- centric campaign \u2013 \u201cHow Alive are you?\u201d to establish the \u201cJaguarness\u201dof its products. Product Life Cycle GLOBAL TREND Swallow Sidecar company launched its first product \u2018motorcycle sidecars\u2019 in 1922. In the following years it started expanding its business by producing complete carsfor passengers. In 1931, the famous S.S models were launched and in 1935, the name Jaguar was adopted by the company and S.S model were renamed as S.S Jaguars.",

    "text": "Spoil Engine. Or how to drop a bomb with style. This 5-piece metalband from Belgium/Holland started out in 2004, combining 90's metal influences such as Pantera, Machine head and Slipknot with postmodern heaviness and soundscapes. Over the years, they evolved to a broader, catchier and even more dynamic sound in the veins of Killswitch Engage, In Flames and BMTH.\nUp 'till now, the band has recorded 3 full albums: 'Skinnerbox v.07 (2007)', 'Antimatter (2009)' and 'The Art of Imperfection (2012)'. With 'Antimatter', Spoil Engine became the first Belgian band in 20 years to sign with Roadrunner International, which led to appearances on national radio ('De Afrekening'), national television and larger venues/festivals such as Graspop (4x), Pukkelpop (2x), AB, Vorst Nationaal and Clubcircuit. They also directly supported bands such as Mot\u00f6rhead, Volbeat, Prong, Killswitch Engage and Arch Enemy only to name a few.\nIn 2015, the band adapted their line-up and switched to female vocalist Iris Goessens from Maastricht (NL). After releasing a first EP, they were signed by Arising Empire & Nuclear Blast. The new album \u2018Stormsleeper\u2019 is the launch of a re-invented band, pushing the limits in sonic bandwidth and energy, ready to conquer new goals. Expect a live explosion of tight metal madness, low end vibes, breast shaking solos and a headbanging smile above all!",

    "text": "exhorting Israel and urging the people to return to God and His law.\nThis book Baruch read to King Jeconiah and the whole people on a day of prayer and penitence. On the same occasion a collection was taken up among the people, and the funds thus secured, together with the silver Temple vessels made by order of Zedekiah after Jeconiah had been carried away captive, were sent to Jerusalem, with the request that the high priest Joakim and the people should apply the money to the sacrificial service and to prayers for the life of King Nebuchadnezzar and his son Belshazzar. Thus they might ensure peace and happiness under Babylonian rule. Above all, they were to supplicate God to turn away His wrath from His people.\nThe piety of Baruch and the great favor he enjoyed with God were made known to later generations many years after his death, through the marvellous occurrences connected with his tomb.\nOnce a Babylonian prince commanded a Jew, Rabbi Solomon by name, to show him the grave of Ezekiel, concerning which he had heard many remarkable tales.\nThe Jew advised the prince first to enter the tomb of Baruch, which adjoined that of Ezekiel.\nIn the presence of his grandees and his people the prince tried to open the grave of Baruch, but his efforts were fruitless. Whosoever touched it, was at once stricken dead.\nAn old Arab advised the prince to call upon the Jews to gain entrance for him, seeing that Baruch had been a Jew, and his books were still being studied by Jews. The Jews prepared themselves by fasts, prayers, penitence, and almsgiving, and they succeeded in opening the grave without a mishap.\nBaruch was found lying on marble bier, and the appearance of the corpse was as though he had only then passed away. (73) The prince ordered the bier to be brought to the city, and the body to be entombed there.\nHe thought it was not seemly that Ezekiel and Baruch should rest in the same grave.\nBut the bearers found it impossible to remove the bier more than two thousands ells from the original grave; not even with the help of numerous draught-animals could it be urged a single step further.\nFollowing the advice of Rabbi Solomon, the prince resolved to enter the bier on the spot they had reached and also to erect an academy there. These miraculous happenings induced the prince to go to Mecca. There he became convinced of the falseness of Mohammedanism, of which he had hitherto been an adherent, and he converted to Judaism, he and his whole court.\nNot less famous is the tomb of Ezekiel, at a distance of two thousand ells from Baruch's. It is overarched by a beautiful mausoleum erected by King Jeconiah after Evil-merodach had released him from captivity. The mausoleum existed down to the middle ages, and it bore on its walls the names of the thirty-five thousand Jews who assisted Jeconiah in erecting the monument.\nIt was the scene of many miracles. When great crowds of people journeyed thither to pay reverence to the memory of the prophet, the little low gate in the wall surrounding the grave enlarged in width and height to admit all who desired to enter.\nOnce a prince vowed to give a colt to the grave of the prophet, if but his mare which had been sterile would bear one. When his wish was fulfilled, however, he did not keep his promise. But the filly ran a distance equal to a four days' journey to the tomb, and his owner could not recover it until he deposited his value in silver upon the grace.\nWhen people went on long journeys, they were in the habit of carrying their treasures to the grave of the prophet, and beseeching him to let none but the rightful heirs remove them thence. The prophet always granted their petition.\nOnce when an attempt was made to take some books from the grave of Ezekiel, the ravager suddenly became sick and blind. For a time a pillar of fire, visible at a great distance, rose above the grave of the prophet, but it disappeared in consequence of the unseemly conduct of the pilgrims who resorted thither.\n2- In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.\n4- And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowest unto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the river Sud.\n5- Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.\n9- After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon.\n12- And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favour in their sight.\n13- Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us.\n14- And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days.\n............and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice.\nto give us a land that floweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day.\n............ to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.\n3- That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter.\n4- Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them.\n5- Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient unto his voice.\n6- To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness- but unto us and to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.\n8- Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.\n9- Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord hath brought it upon us- for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he hath commanded us.\n10- Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, that he hath set before us.\n12- O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances.\n13- Let thy wrath turn from us- for we are but a few left among the heathen, where thou hast scattered us.\n15- That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name.\n16- O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us- bow down thine ear, O Lord, to hear us.\n18- But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord.\n19- Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.\n21- Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon- so shall ye remain in the land that I gave unto your fathers.\nthe voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride- and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants.\n24- But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon- therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest by thy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place.\n25- And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.\n26- And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda.\n29- If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them.\n30- For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiffnecked people- but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves.\n33- And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds- for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord.\n34- And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it- and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.\n35- And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people- and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them.\n1- O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish the troubled spirit, crieth unto thee.\n2- Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for thou art merciful- and have pity upon us, because we have sinned before thee.\n3- For thou endurest for ever, and we perish utterly.\n4- O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned before thee, and not hearkened unto the voice of thee their God- for the which cause these plagues cleave unto us.\n5- Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers- but think upon thy power and thy name now at this time.\n6- For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will we praise.\n7- And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in our captivity- for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before thee.\n8- Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where thou hast scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to payments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God.\n9- Hear, Israel, the commandments of life- give ear to understand wisdom.\n11- That thou art counted with them that go down into the grave?\n12- Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom.\n13- For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldest have dwelled in peace for ever.\n14- Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.\n15- Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into her treasures ?\n17- They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting?\n19- They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads.\n21- Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it- their children were far off from that way.\n22- It hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman.\nnone of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths.\n24- O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession!\n25- Great, and hath none end; high, and unmeasurable.\nthat were of so great stature, and so expert in war.\n28- But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness.\n29- Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her (Wisdom, Sophia), and brought her down from the clouds?\n30- Who hath gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold?\n31- No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path.\nGoing across the Sea was the sin at Mount Sinai as they rose up to PLAY. This was musical idolatry worshiping the Golden Calf as the symbol of the Egyptian Triad: Osiris, Isis and Horus.\nWe are not saved by FAITH ONLY. Paul speaks of THE FAITH as replacing THE LAW. THE FAITH is the Christian system. We know this because people who lived under THE LAW were men of personal faith (Heb 11).\nTHE LAW applied to the LAWLESS. The law used the ORIENTIAL INCENTIVE which was physical punishment. If we are not under the SCHOOLMASTER we are no longer under ANY human agency which had rather CONTROL than to let the people LEARN the lessons directly from God incarnate who left his written Word. A \"child\" is accused by Jesus as being the \"chorus leaders\" as the lost Jews piped hoping to get Him to sing and dance the perverted ritual of Dionysus.\nA \"child\" here is huios which means that we have GRADUATED from human tutors.\nPaul wrote the same message to the Colossians.

    "text": "While he does not generally receive mainstream hobby love, Grant Hill rookie cards and memorabilia have a near-cult following, which ensures good values in the years to come. Hill is one of those players that does not carry superstar status, but almost everyone knows who he is and respects his game.\nDespite his popularity and long career, Grant Hill had very few autographed cards until he was added to 2010-11 Panini products. He has also signed for Upper Deck products, so collectors should be able to find plenty of autograph options between the two brands.\nWhile 1994-95 sets don't carry as much value as those issued later in the decade, card designs began to see significant changes. This allows for several great-looking Grant Hill rookie cards, and most still remain very affordable.\nGrant Hill has 15 rookie cards that mostly fall in the low-budget category. However, the trio below sticks out as the best options for collectors.\nView the most popular Grant Hill card listings on eBay.\nShop for specific cards on eBay using the links below.\nGold and silver foil combine with a young Grant Hill to make a great rookie option for collectors. Although the gold and silver colors clash, the action image in the foreground makes Grant Hill seem to pop off the card.\nGrant Hill's Flair rookie card features a refined design that properly highlights the young rookie. The home and away jerseys utilized in the two images contrast nicely and the gold foil text adds a high-end touch.\n1994-95 Finest represents the top option for Grant Hill card collectors. Lots of color and a metallic rainbow effect make for an exciting card. The highest values can be found with the Refractor parallels.\nALLEN IVERSON 96-97 NBA Hoops GRANT HILL'S ALL-ROOKIE TEAM ACETATE ROOKIE RARE !\n1994-95 Fleer Ultra All-Rookie Grant Hill #2 Detroit Pistons \"Very nice card\"\n1994-95 Classic #4 Grant Hill RC Duke Rookie Card!\nBelow you will find an example of what Grant Hill's authentic signature looks like. This can be used as a first point of reference for determining the legitimacy of autograph memorabilia, but is not a substitute for having your items authenticated by a well respected professional autograph authentication company. Reputable authentication companies include JSA, PSA, Panini Authentic, Upper Deck Authentic, Tristar and Mounted Memories to name a few.\nSigned on a relatively even horizontal plane, the signature may exhibit a slight downward angle.\nThe letters lean to the right at about 50 degrees.\nThe letters \"G\" and \"H\" are the main component as many other letters are implied.\nThe letter \"G\" consists of two parts, made all in one pen stroke; the first part looks like a printed capital letter \"M\" and the other looks similar to a cursive capital \"J.\"\nOut of this letter is a line with a slight squiggle in it, implying the letters \"r-a-n-t.\"\nThe pen continues into a letter \"H\" formed with two parallel lines. Again, the stroke appears like a cursive capital letter \"J\" as in the first name.\nA dot is usually present implying the letter \"i.\"\nThe letters \"l-l\" are not written.\nGrant Hill signed autographed basketball!

    "text": "Dr. Azeem Latib, Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, San Raffaele University Hospital, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milan, Italy.\nTricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding in patients with left-sided disease, and is associated with poor outcome and predicts poor survival, heart failure, and reduced functional capacity (1). It is common after mitral valve treatment in rheumatic or ischemic mitral regurgitation, if left untreated at the time of mitral surgery. In this subgroup with long-standing TR, managed medically for a long time, surgical correction can be more prohibitive due to the presence of variable degrees of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, and right heart failure. The pre-operative condition of the RV and the severity of secondary renal and hepatic impairment are predictors of limited survival (2,3). Percutaneous procedures may be an attractive alternative to surgery for patients deemed to be high-risk surgical candidates. While the development and clinical use of percutaneous approaches to the aortic valve and mitral valve have been widespread over the past few years, limited data are available about the feasibility and efficacy of percutaneous tricuspid valve (TV) therapies (4,5).\nThe TriCinch System (4Tech Cardio Ltd., Galway, Ireland) is a percutaneous device designed for TV remodeling, by means of a transfemoral fixation of a stainless steel corkscrew into the anteroposterior TV annulus. The corkscrew is connected through a Dacron band to a self-expanding nitinol stent. By pulling the system towards the inferior vena cava (IVC), the anchoring corkscrew remodels the anteroposterior annulus, and the tension is maintained by fixation of the stent in the IVC. The stent is available in different sizes (27 to 43 mm in diameter, 60 mm in length) to guarantee oversizing in the hepatic region of the IVC (Figure 1). The \u201cfirst-in-man\u201d patient was a 72-year-old woman with severe functional TR associated with tricuspid annular dilation. She was admitted in New York Heart Association functional class III after 2 episodes of decompensated heart failure in the previous 2 months, presenting with edema of the lower extremities, moderate ascites, jugular venous distension, with moderate liver dysfunction due to hepatitis C (unconjugated bilirubin 2.7 mg/dl) and normal kidney function (creatinine 1 mg/dl, glomerular filtration rate 57.8 ml/min). She had a clinical history of permanent atrial fibrillation and prior aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis. The STS Score risk of mortality was 5.2% (morbidity or mortality 34.7%). Transesophageal echocardiography revealed grade 4+ TR (with systolic hepatic vein flow reversal, 9 mm lack of coaptation, and septolateral dimension of 46 mm at transthoracic echocardiography [TTE] assessment) (Figure 2), moderate right ventricular dysfunction (tricuspid tissue Doppler imaging systolic velocity 8 cm/s and systolic pulmonary artery pressure 42 mm Hg) with a normal functioning mitral valve, maintained aortic prosthesis function (mean gradient 6 mm Hg), and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. After multidisciplinary heart team agreement on the transcatheter TV repair option with the TriCinch System, the patient was enrolled in the PREVENT (Percutaneous Treatment of Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation With the TriCinch System; NCT02098200) study. Procedural planning, based on cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan, predicted the safe anchoring area at the level of the anterior tricuspid annulus (between the right coronary artery and anterior leaflet\u2019s hinge) (Figure 3A) and the adequate stent size to be used to guarantee the best vessel oversizing (IVC mean diameter 26 mm, oversizing 60%). The intervention was performed under general anesthesia, fluoroscopy, as well as intracardiac and transesophageal echocardiography guidance. A 10-F intracardiac echocardiography probe was inserted via the left femoral vein and a Judkins right guiding catheter via the left femoral artery to perform right coronary angiography. A 24-F Gore Dry-seal sheath was inserted in the right femoral vein for insertion of the 18-F steerable TriCinch delivery system into the right atrium. The tip of the delivery system was steered toward the target site on the tricuspid annulus. The corkscrew was inserted into the annulus. Any interference with the right coronary artery was ruled out by selective angiography (Figure 3B). The system was tensioned under echo guidance until a reduction in septolateral dimension (intraoperative at transesophageal echocardiography from 41 mm to 38 mm) and in TR grade (from 4+ to 3+) was observed (Figure 4, Online Video 1) and 5-mm coaptation length became evident. The cinching of the tricuspid annulus was maintained by implantation of a 43-mm self-expanding nitinol stent in the IVC between the hepatic veins and the right renal vein (Figure 3C). The procedure was completed uneventfully in 56 min, and the patient was discharged 5 days later, with TTE documenting the maintained remodeling of the TV (TR grade 3+ and septolateral diameter of 40 mm at TTE assessment) and showing the device correctly in place with continued tension on the annulus. At 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good functional status with improved quality of life.\nProcedural steps of the TriCinch TV repair system showing reduction of septolateral dimensions (yellow arrows) when cinching and tension is applied on the annulus in the direction of the inferior vena cava (red arrows). TV = tricuspid valve.\nBaseline tricuspid valve (TV) septolateral dimension and lack of coaptation (A) and severe tricuspid regurgitation (B) at transthoracic echocardiogram.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan pre-procedural planning (A), TriCinch System corkscrew (B), and stent (C) fluoroscopic implantation. Target area (asterisk) was identified at CT scan and fluoroscopic imaging. APC = anteroposterior commissure; ASC = anteroseptal commissure; AV = aortic valve; MV = mitral valve; TV = tricuspid valve.\nPre-procedural (A and C) and post-procedural (B and D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): following TriCinch implantation, tricuspid regurgitation reduces the tricuspid regurgitation grade from 4+ (A) to 3+ (B), and septolateral annular dimension from 41 mm (C) to 38 mm (D) (Online Video 1).\nPre-procedural versus post-procedural tricuspid regurgitation (TR) at transesophageal echocardiogram, demonstrating effective remodeling of the tricuspid valve.\nThe TriCinch is the first dedicated TV repair device to be evaluated in humans in a prospective trial. The design concept of the TriCinch system was initially based on mimicking the Kay procedure by cinching at the anteroposterior commissure and reducing septolateral dimensions. This first-in-man case demonstrates the feasibility and safety of the percutaneous remodeling of the TV by implanting the TriCinch device, associated with reduction in annular dimensions and TR severity. Although the device only resulted in a modest reduction in TR, this may be sufficient for symptomatic improvement in these patients in whom elimination of TR may be harmful. This also raises the question as to whether the correct measure of efficacy in patients with severe TR is echocardiographic or symptoms and quality of life. Longer-term follow-up and more patients are required to confirm these initial results and will define the risk\u2013benefit balance of future TR treatment strategies.\nThis work was supported by 4Tech Cardio Ltd., Galway, Ireland.

    "text": "Carl Franz Bally was born in Schonenwed, Switzerland in 1821. He was the son of a silk ribbon weaver, and together with his brother had taken over the family business in 1847. Carl Franz expanded the company to include an elastic tape that was used by shoemakers.\nWhile on a business trip in Paris in 1850, Bally he was fascinated by a pair of subtly decorated slippers he found for his wife. He bought several pairs of different styles and later started to manufacture his own collections in his factory.\nIn 1951 together with his brother Carl founded \u201cBally&Co\u201d, hiring a German shoemaker, who worked in the basement of his own home. Initially the shoes were entirely handmade, but manufacturing process was based on the division of labor. Just 3 years after the shoe production was started in 1854 a factory was built in the centre of the village and later when his brother Fritz left the business Carl Franz Bally founds the company \u201cC.F.Bally\u201d. Shortly first shops were opened in Bern, Basle and Zurich and exports to South America began.\nIn the 1860s the factory was enlarged to accommodate over 500 workers. First sewing machines and steam machines were introduced resulting in increased productivity. In 1868 a new elastic ribbon factory was build by Bally. It required the construction of a water channel to power water-driven turbine for the MacKay sole sewing machine. This was the start of mechanization of the production process, which was almost entirely mechanized by the end of the 1870s, with all the latest advances in technology from the UK and the USA, introduced at the factory by Franz\u2019s son Edward after his trips to these countries.\nThanks the quality of the material, excellent finish and refined decoration Bally shoes at the end of the century stood for luxury and the company was occupying the leading position in Europe. New agencies were opened in Barcelona, Cairo, Vienna, Hamburg, Lisbon, Marseille and Sofia. In 1881 the first Bally shop was opened in London\u2019s most fashionable street New Bond Street.\nTen years later, in 1892 Carl Franz Bally handed the company over to his sons. \u201cC.F. Bally and Sons\u201d was entering the last decade of the 19th century with two millions pairs of shoes produced annually. Carl Franz Bally \u2013 the founder of the company died in 1898 but his son continued the business.\nEconomic boom of the 1900s and free trade helped the company to build up important markets in France, Germany, Austria and Italy. In 1907 Bally went public, with the majority of shares owned by the family members. The company continued to grow. Building new tanneries, shoe factories and stores. Even the First World War did not affect Bally, as it was supplying military shoes to the French, German and Swiss armies.\nIn the twenties C.F. Bally AG was established as a holding company with five separate divisions for retail, wholesale, production, tannery and real estate. Later a retail company Bally Arola AG was founded as a separate entity.\nBally survived the world depression of the 30s and WWII restrictions and limitations by using different materials like rubber, cork, wood and straw and later diversifying its production to include shoes for every occasion: work, leisure and sport.\nIn the boom years of the 50s Bally was rapidly expanding and could only satisfy the demand by spreading out its operations to South Africa, Brazil and Belgium. Further diversification into several industries specialized in rubber, glues and other chemicals was a result of the market saturation in the 60s due to cheap imports and exports decline. In 1976 Bally adds handbags and other leather accessories to the shoe line.\nSuccessfully growing through the difficult 80s, when Bally product was compromised because of improper distribution and quality problems, caused by inappropriate licensing, Bally regains its global luxury brand image in the 90s. In 1999 Bally was sold to the Texas Pacific Group, which launched a new strategy to reposition the company. The 150th anniversary, which was celebrated by the company in 2001, has met Bally as one of the leaders of the world luxury market, with new stores being opened in China, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Turkey, Nepal, Brazil, Hungary, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and Russia. A new show room was open in the European fashion capital Milan in 2003 for the convenience of the press and buyers during fashion weeks and presentation of collections.\nToday Bally prides itself in about 200 mono-brand stores around the globe and plans to go ahead with new shops opening in Sydney, Shanghai, Taipei, Dusseldorf and Beverly Hills.\nThe love for shoes have led the Bally family to begin collecting shoes back in the 19th century \u2013 the passion, which resulted in setting up the Bally Shoe Museum in Schonenwerd, Switzerland, where they have gathered the most extensive collection of historical boots and shoes ever seen under one roof.",

    "text": "Competition is vital to our current social structure. Businesses compete for the best employees, schools compete for the best teachers, sports teams for the best records, grocery stores for the best produce, students for the best grades, etc. This idea of limited resources is everywhere in society which leads us to constantly be evaluating and judging people and situations. Charles Darwin introduced us to the idea of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d and we\u2019ve definitely run with it. But now I\u2019m finding competition to be destructive to my quality of life and I\u2019m wondering if we can do without it.\nIn my ideal world I\u2019m accepted and appreciated for who I am today, and I spend my time and energy contributing to my community in a productive way. Instead of tearing the people around me down so I can outcompete them, I\u2019m building them up so our community can be stronger. We take care of each other when we\u2019re down instead of climbing on top of the weak.\nIt seems that competition drives deadlines and hard work but the perpetual motion prevents us from stepping back and seeing the destination. If we look at the people at the top of the pile, they\u2019re successful but our their lives empty? Can they be happy knowing that maintaining their spot at the top mandates pushing the people at the bottom down?\nThis is definitely an oversimplification with unfair stereotypes, but the general trends seems appropriate. My question is, where would things settle out if we did away with competition? Would society be dragged down by free loaders and unmotivated people or would we connect with a deeper desire to love, contribute, and grow. Is dhamma leading me to resist competing? Only time will tell. Time to meditate.\nI think what makes people want to invest in community, is feeling safe with a particular community. Like you said, \u201cfeeling accepted and appreciated by the group.\u201d If it\u2019s a live-in ecovillage where all aspects of people\u2019s lives are wrapped up in that community, feeling safe gets a lot more complicated!\nIn my opinion, meditators or people that handle stress well are more inclined to feel safe, and therefore have a better chance at building cooperative communities.\nThat being said, members will still have to choose what they want more and less of in their lives. For example, who they nominate to do a certain job, carry a responsibility, or who they feel most compatible with in a personal relationship. It can\u2019t be everyone, b/c people aren\u2019t all equally skilled at everything and only have so much available time (in this life anyways). So I don\u2019t see competition going away completely, but more so the way it\u2019s perceived.\nWhen more people stay conscious of the fact that each individual can only know a limited perception of others maybe more individuals will feel safe amidst competition. As competition only reveals a fragment of the self, so value-judging someone as a whole doesn\u2019t make sense.\nAnyway, it\u2019s an interesting question and I think you\u2019re exactly on track.\nYes, and in addition, most anthropological thought favors the idea that the human species was able to survive \u2013 in the intense physical situation faced by early humans \u2013 by cooperating with each other, as in hunter-gatherer societies is still the case. Language perhaps arose because it facilitated that cooperation. Competing with each other even now seems to be counter-productive in the long run.\nOnce I was listening to the interview of one of the biggest industrialist in India and owns a TV channel, also following Vipassana for more than 20 years. The question asked was to him that your channel had been 2nd in TRP and business, making good profits, what are your plans and will you make an effort to take it to 1st. He replied I need not have to be emotional about being 1st, if my channel is 2nd and consistently continues to be at 2nd, I would be happy with it.",

That said we have held the 7770/80 resistance area overnight and dropped off that, which keeps the chance of a back test of the 7715 previous support area alive.\nBreaking 7740 has adjusted the daily resistance levels of note now, and while the top of the 10 day Raff channel is still around the 7785 level, there is also 7829 flagging up now.

    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2013 Saks Inc. (SKS), which announced last month it is selling off its Proffitt&apos;s and McRae&apos;s department stores, on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter as its mid-price department-store business continues to languish.\nFor the first quarter ended April 30, income was $17.1 million, or 12 cents per share. The latest results include a gain of a penny per share from disposing of closed stores, offset by a penny per share related to expenses from an investigation of alleged improper collections of money from vendors at its Saks Fifth Avenue (search) division.\nOn average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of 16 cents per share in the latest quarter.\nSales totaled $1.55 billion, a slight 0.6 percent increase from $1.54 billion a year earlier and a bit below the $1.56 billion expected from Wall Street analysts.\nAt all of Saks&apos; stores open at least a year, sales grew 1.9 percent last quarter, with a 5.5 percent increase at Saks Fifth Avenue shops offsetting a 0.9 percent drop in its department-store group.\nSaks did not report its year-ago profit results because it expects to restate financial results for fiscal 1999 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the investigation of markdown money and other related financial and accounting issues.\nMarkdown money is what suppliers pay to compensate stores when they don&apos;t sell products or are forced to take deeper markdowns than expected. Last week, the company announced it fired its chief accounting officer and other top officers as a result of the investigation.\nThe company, which is also the target of an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (search) and U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office in New York, said Tuesday it is working to confirm the amount of total vendor markdown allowances determined to have been improperly collected. As a result, all the results are preliminary and remain subject to change.\nLast month, Saks said it agreed to sell its Proffitt&apos;s (search) and McRae&apos;s department stores (search) to privately held retailer Belk Inc. for $622 million in cash. The stores have annual revenue of about $700 million. The company also said it&apos;s exploring strategic options for its northern mid-price department store division, which consist of 143 stores under the names of Carson, Pirie Scott, Bergner&apos;s, Boston Store, Younkers and Herberger&apos;s.\nShares of Saks fell 12 cents to $16.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.",

I depart for Vienna tomorrow, where I shall stay at the Hotel Imperial until Tuesday [April 22nd] midday. If it were not possible for me to call on you, on account of the very limited time, I should be most grateful if you would drop me a line there. I think one should at least ponder whether you might put yourself in a worse position with Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel than with Hertzka.\nOC 54 is a folder of correspondence relating to the publishing firm of Drei Masken Verlag and Das Meisterwerk in der Musik. This letter, and OC 54/297\u2012301, were filed there presumably because they were tangentially related to what became Meisterwerk III.\n2 The enclosed letter, from Karl Straube, is not preserved with this letter and does not appear to survive among Schenker's papers. However, OC 54/218, May 14, 1930, from Straube to Schenker, states that he has consulted Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel, who consider \"a new collaboration between publishing houses\" to be impossible under current economic conditions. In a postscript of May 16 to the same letter, he reports his consultation with C. F. Peters, who say that a \"take-over of publication of your work\" met with refusal. Since both letters are filed with Schenker's correspondence concerning Das Meisterwerk in der Musik , it is probable that Straube's letter refers to that.",

    "text": "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council annually presents a scholarship award in memory of Charles W. Eliot II. Mr. Eliot was an advocate of local planning as part of regional cooperation, and he was especially interested in land use planning as it affected transportation (coordination of trains, buses, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians), the need for communities to balance residential, business and open space, and the role of planning to solve modern problems (like today\u2019s climate change). This scholarship is open to any senior in a secondary school in the 101 cities and towns of the MAPC region, who is planning to further his/her/their education in these fields. A cash prize of at least $500 will be awarded in the form of a scholarship to the school of the recipient's choice.\nIf you would like more information about this award, please feel free to contact Heidi Anderson at MAPC at the address shown above or by phone at (617) 933-0764.\nThe deadline for 2019 applications is May 10, 2019.

The provided tool should be able to efficiently produce modeling results for multiple scenarios based on changing assumptions about the scale, location, mix, and form of future development; the routes, speed, and frequency of future transit services; and the nature of transportation demand management policies put into place.\nThe application of the tool will ultimately inform the planning of new transportation investments and land use policies by prioritizing options that should be subject to more detailed analysis and modeling. The sketch modeling tool is intended to complement the region\u2019s existing travel demand model operated by the Central Transportation Planning Staff. While the first application will be for the West Station Area Transit Study, MAPC seeks a tool with transparent, state-of-practice methods that can be transferred to other study areas in the region as the need arises.\nThe Metropolitan Area Planning Council (\u201cMAPC\u201d), pursuant to M.G.L. c. 7 \u00a7 22B and M.G.L. 30B, is seeking proposals from qualified Proposers to supply heavy and medium duty public works construction equipment and related options to the members of the Greater Boston Police Council (\u201cGBPC\u201d), operators of the Boston Area Police Emergency Radio Network (\u201cBAPERN\u201d). MAPC will be the awarding authority on behalf of GBPC. Proposals will be evaluated against quality requirements and evaluation criteria set out in the RFP, and by considering the prices offered. Those Proposers identified as being responsible and responsive and offering the most advantageous proposals against these factors will be awarded contracts.\nThe Request for Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) may be obtained from MAPC, by contacting Marjorie Weinberger, by email at: mweinberger@mapc.org on or after March 11, 2019 10:00 a.m. An optional Respondents Conference will be held March 27, 2019 from 10:00 a.m. \u201312:00 p.m. at the Walpole Library located at 143 School Street, Walpole MA. Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m. on May 1, 2019, at MAPC, 60 Temple Place, 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02111 (6th Floor Reception Desk). Price proposals and technical proposals must be submitted separately, sealed, and clearly marked. Late proposals will not be accepted.\nThe term of any contract resulting from this RFP will be from the date of execution through June 1, 2020, with the possibility of two one-year extensions. MAPC reserves the right to cancel all or part of this solicitation and to reject in whole or part any and all proposals. No bid bond is required.\nMAPC is administering this procurement on behalf of the Consortium and the Participating Member Municipalities. MAPC will identify responsible and responsive low bidders and make recommendations of award. Individual contracts will be executed between the Participating Member Municipalities and the low bidders. The Participating Member Municipalities reserve the right to accept or reject such recommendations and to award contracts with the low bidders as deemed in their best interest. MAPC and the Consortium reserve the right to accept or reject any and all bids or portions thereof, to waive any informalities in bidding, and to recommend awards as appear in the best interest of the Consortium and its members.\nBid documents may be obtained by contacting Marjorie Weinberger by email at mweinberger@mapc.org, beginning April 22, 2019 through May 13, 2019. Massachusetts Prevailing Wage Laws apply to all services. Bid Bonds, Performance Bonds, and Labor & Materials Payment Bonds are required. Sealed bids will be accepted until 1:00 PM, May 16, 2019 at 60 Temple Place, Boston, MA 02111 at which time they will be publicly opened.\nPlease note that bids from Bidders not listed by MassDOT as prequalified in the specific class of work with a single contract limit at or above the dollar value of the projects or who are not listed on a waiver contractor bid list as of the day of the bid will be rejected. Vendors are advised that the initial contract term is for one year. MAPC reserves the right to extend the contract for two additional 12 month options. Valuation for purposes of MassDOT Prequalification is based on first year times three (3) to arrive at an estimated total Prequal. contract value. Contractors who are not prequalified to provide the services listed for the total Prequal. contract value, but meet the single year waiver threshold (+50% of year 1 prequalification; example $100,000 limit = $150,000 waiver) and want to bid, should submit a waiver request at least two (2) weeks prior to the bid opening to allow for time to appeal in the event that a waiver is not granted. The estimated value provided in this Invitation to Bid is for one (1) year. Vendors are expected to be able to provide their services over three (3) years at three (3) times the initial estimated value.\nThe Metropolitan Area Planning Council (\u201cMAPC\u201d), in partnership with and on behalf of interested municipalities, is seeking responsive proposals from qualified consultants to conduct a streetlight inventory audit, design of streetlight retrofit with LEDs, assist with procurement of product and installation, and perform project management pursuant to M.G.L. c. 7 \u00a7 22B and M.G.L. c.30B. MAPC will be the awarding authority. Contracts will be awarded to those Respondents deemed responsible and responsive. This will be determined by evaluating Respondents against the quality requirements and evaluation criteria set out in the RFP, and by considering the prices offered. Those Respondents identified as offering the most advantageous proposals against these factors will be awarded a contract.\nThe Request for Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) may be obtained from MAPC, by contacting Cara Goodman, by email at cgoodman@mapc.org on or after Thursday April 18, 2019 at 12:00 p.m. Proposals are due at 12:00 p.m., Friday May 17, 2019 at MAPC, 60 Temple Place, 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02111. Price and technical proposals must be submitted separately, sealed, and clearly marked. Late proposals will not be accepted.\nMAPC reserves the right to cancel all or part of this solicitation and to reject in whole or part any and all proposals. No bid deposit is required.",

That\u2019s why as 2019 progresses we\u2019re going to decrease our weekly blog to fortnightly and we\u2019ll be slowly shutting down the fair majority of our security consultancy work for organisations around the North East and concentrating solely on the expansionof our investigatory arm so that we can deliver more services to more solicitors, insurers and businesses around Newcastle, Tyne and Wear and the like.\nOnce again, VERY little of what we\u2019ve achieved over the last two years would have been possible without the support of our clients who not only come back to us repeatedly but who recommend us to others. Nor would it be possible without people sharing our social media posts and promoting us locally to individuals and businesses struggling with a problem and needing professional investigatory support.\nWe never wanted to just be \u201cPIs\u201d.\nWe always wanted to be professional problem-solvers for anyone who needed help.\nSo thank you enormously from everyone here at Surmount Investigations.",

    "text": "Two games for you today. Both are ZvZ match-ups with valuable lessons to learn. I used to have a lot of trouble with ZvZ until I learned how to progress past Roach-fests. The answer, as I've discovered it, is committing to air. Pulling this off without alerting the opponent is key. When you show up to the next fight, or his base, with 6+ mutalisks, you've probably gained the momentum -- exactly what a Zerg player needs.\nControl the pace of the game so that you can tech to tier 3 while he's scrambling to assemble hydras. While getting Hive and Greater Spire, pump out 2-4 Corrupters and harass Overlords. When you can, upgrade them to Brood Lords and mop up!\nThis next game is a little different. My opponent was first to air, but I was anticipating it and had hydras ready to go. He completely backs off from going air and lets me take over the skies with Corrupters.\nPlayed three games of Dominion with Adam today. Here is a brief summary.\nHalfway into this game, Adam and I both commented on how much we liked the set. It was chosen at random, but we liked having Militia in a game with no defensive cards to limit the crazy Village, Nobles, Council Room combinations. Adam was particularly fond of giving me bonus cards with Council Room, only to then play a Militia to make me discard down to 3. We both loved the role of Island to let us remove Estates and Coppers early on.\nWe elected to play the same set again. This time I played an Upgrade heavy deck in order to shoot to Gold, Nobles, trash Coppers, and upgrade Estates. While functional, clearly it wasn't as great a strategy as the first game.\n\"Throne Rooms!!!\" we both cheered, as the new random set appeared. There was much Throne Room-ing. We each had a hand of nothing but Throne Rooms and treasure cards at one point. Fortunately for me, I caught on to Throne Room + Remodel before Adam did, allowing me to eek by and take the last Province before he did. For the record, Throne Room + Mine to take a Copper straight to Gold in a single turn is amazingly valuable.\nI'm pleased with the overall balance of units. With proper scouting and foresight, any race can prepare and counter any attack. This game feels more hard-counter driven than some RTS games, especially StarCraft 1. I don't know if that means the game has been harder to balance. Because I play Zerg, I do feel like there are more limited starting options because of the Roach unit becoming such a staple.\nThe interface is a dream. I can do things I only complained about for ten years in StarCraft. Mixed building/unit control groups, tab-able sub-groups, visible attack queue-ing.... oh how much easier it is to control the game!\nI'm going to start posting replays of interesting games here on the blog. I'll be using sc2rc.com to host them. Feel free to view them and post your thoughts here or on the sc2rc.com page.\nOverall, the first PAX East convention was awesome, but somewhat of a mixed bag. I won't write about the negatives too much, so let me get them out of the way.\nEach room of the Hynes Convention Center was undersized for its purpose. The main event room only held about 5,000 out of the ~45,000 present each day. The opening ceremonies (Wil Wheaton keynote + first Mike and Jerry Q&A) filled up and we still waited over an hour in line to get turned away at the door. Panel rooms were so small that attendance typically required 45-60 minutes of queue-ing. Tabletop gaming was split into eight rooms across two floors!\nCoordination needs improvement. The enforcers need team leaders with walkie-talkies. The halls needed more signage about where you are going and what's nearby. Panels needed better organization, like the track system Dragon*Con uses.\nThe con should be open a full three days. Doors did not open until 2pm on Friday and things wrapped up around 6pm on Sunday. I would like to see doors open at 10am on Friday. There just wasn't enough time to do everything. Heck, I didn't fully explore the Expo Hall or even SEE the console and computer game rooms. I elected to skip panels altogether in lieu of better time management. I only briefly saw the Rock Band room, but would have liked to play a song or two with friends.\nOK, enough dragging PAX East down. They are moving to a bigger convention center next year and will have all the feedback they need from this year.\nWe brought an entire suitcase of games to PAX East. Not kidding. 3x Dominion games, Puerto Rico, Power Grid, Race for the Galaxy + expansion, Hoopla, We Didn't Playtest This + Either, Battlestar Galactica, Mix-Up, and some Magic: The Gathering decks.\nMostly, we played Dominion, but there was also a game of BSG and some rounds of Hoopla and RftG.\nJosh and I entered the Puerto Rico tournament. To prove how much we've played the game, we took second and third, respectively. About 25 players signed up, half were scrubs, and two significant players didn't make it to the final game of four. Josh and I both played Factory games in our first two matches to great success. In the final game, I took an early lead as a Corn Baron but lost momentum towards the end. The guy who took first place played a similar Indigo Baron strategy, but when pressured by coffee and tobacco ship blocking, responded with a Wharf where I responded with Harbor and crop diversification. In retrospect, I should have gone Wharf over Harbor. No regrets, though! We had a blast and I even got my medal signed by Wil Wheaton!\nWe befriended Chris from Asmadi Games and he played some games with us Saturday night and Sunday. Look forward to meeting up with him again at Dragon*Con this fall.\nThe classic console game room was a little eye-watering. They had several stations setup with functional consoles from Atari to Dreamcast. A vast library of games could be checked out for all the systems. So cool to see folks playing classics like Armored Core, Mario Kart SNES, Battletoads, Goldeneye, and so much more.\nOh my God, the concerts. First off, I was sure I wasn't getting into either night of concerts based on the size of the event room. However, I got insanely lucky and was able to walk into the room on both nights, just in time to see the acts I wanted to play. Both nights, technical difficulty and other delays turned into brilliant timing for me.\nOn Friday, I saw The Protomen and Anamanaguchi. I had heard The Protomen's self-titled album once or twice and figured they were worth checking out. Holy hell, they were. I was completely blown away by The Protomen's showmanship. Make-up, costumes, atmosphere, choreography... total mind blowage. I've never seen so much fist-pumping in my life. Definitely check out their work and see their show if you like their style.\nAnamanaguchi was fun to see live, but I think the sound levels were off. My favorite part of their act is the chip tune music, but on stage their guitars were way overpowering. The front man was very cheerful and it was easy to tell he was as happy to be there as we were. They played some new tunes and it's clear they have a bright future. Absolutely check out their cheery chip tune rock if you haven't yet.\nOn Saturday, I showed up just in time to see Paul and Storm hit the stage with Wil Wheaton for this magical sketch- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_IRwTtkZEI I had never seen Paul and Storm or Jonathan Coulton live before. It was definitely a treat. Paul and Storm are superb musical comedians who write catchy folk music. Their ability to engage the audience was inspiring and entertaining. I've been listening to JoCo songs for years now, but seeing him live was also a treat. I didn't get anything super special outside live performance of his work. OK, OK, the Distract-a-tron was cool.\nLike I said before, we all had a great time, the con was a blast, we will certainly be going to future PAXs, but this new one has some kinks to work out, which I have full faith in Penny Arcade to resolve.",

    "text": "Bhopal: 29 Nov. 2018, An Indian rocket successfully lofted 31 satellites to Earth orbit late Wednesday night (Nov. 28), just a few days before the scheduled liftoff of a SpaceX booster that's even more jam-packed.\nThe Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, on India's southeast coast, at 11:27 p.m. EST (0427 GMT and 0957 local Indian time on Nov. 29).\nThe PSLV's primary payload was the 840-lb. (380 kilograms) HySIS satellite, whose main goal \"is to study the Earth's surface in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum,\" officials with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) wrote in a statement after the successful launch.\nAlso aboard the PSLV were 29 nanosatellites and one microsatellite, which were provided by eight different countries. All of these little spacecraft reached their intended orbits, ISRO officials said.\nThis phalanx included 16 \"Dove\" Earth-observing cubesats built by San Francisco-based company Planet and two shoebox-size \"Pioneer spacecraft.\" The Pioneers are owned by the company Spire Global but were developed under the European Space Agency's ARTES (Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems) Pioneer program.\nThe twin Pioneers will test the ability of tiny spacecraft to perform \"radio occultation\" science, European Space Agency officials said. This work consists of measuring how satellite signals are refracted by Earth's atmosphere, information that can in turn help characterize the atmosphere, potentially aiding weather and climate forecasts.\nThe PSLV launch serves as something of a prelude for the upcoming SSO-A: SmallSat Express mission, which is scheduled to lift off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Sunday (Dec. 2). The two-stage Falcon 9 will carry to orbit 64 small satellites, including one that contains a bust of Robert H. Lawrence Jr., the first African-American astronaut.\nSSO-A will also mark the first time that a Falcon 9 first stage has launched on three separate orbital missions. This first stage also helped loft Bangladesh's Bangabandhu-1 communications satellite in May and the Merah Putih satellite for PT Telkom Indonesia in August.\nSixty-four satellites is a lot, but it won't set the record: A PSLV launched 104 spacecraft to orbit back in February 2017.",

The Citizens are the first Edinburgh club to reach the last four of the competition in 25 years \u2013 the last team from the capital to do so were Meadowbank Thistle, who lost 3-2 to Falkirk at Brockville in 1993/94. James McDonaugh\u2019s side have reached the last four by beating four teams from four different divisions \u2013 Alloa from the Championship, Arbroath from League 1, Albion Rovers from League 2 and East Kilbride from the Lowland League. They could have the opportunity to face a side from a fifth different league in the semi-final, with Connah\u2019s Quay Nomads of the Welsh Premier League and Bohemians from the League of Ireland both featuring in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s draw.\n6 \u2013 Ross County defeated Motherwell Colts 2-1 at Fir Park to move into the IRN-BRU Cup semi-finals. The Staggies have reached this stage for the sixth time - they have won four of their previous five semi-finals. County have won nine of their last 10 away matches in this competition \u2013 the exception was a 1-0 defeat to rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the 2009/10 semi-final. County have won the trophy twice \u2013 against Clyde in 2006/07 and Queen of the South in 2010/11.\n3 \u2013 Inverness Caledonian Thistle extended their unbeaten league record to 25 matches after coming from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with Queen of the South at Palmerston. The last time the Caley Jags came from three goals behind to gain a point was a 4-4 draw with Dundee United in December 2012. On that occasion United led 3-0 within eight minutes, then Inverness roared back to lead 4-3, only to concede a last-minute Jon Daly penalty. John Robertson\u2019s side have not lost a Ladbrokes Championship match since March, but have drawn an incredible 10 of their 14 league games so far this season.\n5 \u2013 Arbroath remain 10 points clear at the top of Ladbrokes League 1 after thumping rivals Brechin City 5-1 at Glebe Park. The Red Lichties have won five consecutive league matches for the first time since September-October 2014. It was their biggest derby win over City in almost 50 years \u2013 the last time they beat Brechin by a four-goal margin was a 5-1 success in September 1969. On that day, just like on Saturday, Arbroath had five different scorers \u2013 Jimmy Jack, Tommy Ward, Harry Campbell, Jim Cant and an Alastair Littlejohn own goal.\n2 \u2013 Berwick Rangers defeated Albion Rovers 2-0 at Shielfield to move further away from the Ladbrokes League 2 relegation zone. After a slow start, new Berwick boss Johnny Harvey has picked up two consecutive victories to build up an eight-point gap on Rovers at the bottom, and move to within nine points of Annan Athletic in the final promotion play-off spot. Prior to this weekend, it had been over two-and-a-half years since The Wee Rangers won two league matches in a row in the same season \u2013 that came back in April 2016.",

    "text": "A beefy and charismatic left-hander, Mark Greatbatch was a solid batsman at Test level but in limited-overs cricket he could be a different character and was one of the first one-day pinch hitters. He learnt his trade in the leagues of New Zealand and England, and ground out an unusually dogged hundred on his Test debut against England in 1987-88, and again at Perth in 1989-90, when he staved off what looked to be certain Australian victory, making an unbeaten 146. He started the 1990 tour of England with hundreds in successive one-day internationals, but his form thereafter was patchy. At the 1992 World Cup he was left out of New Zealand's opening two matches, but thereafter was instrumental in their success and ended with 313 runs at 44.71. He followed with another Test hundred against Pakistan, but a loss of form, especially against the short ball, and a new national captain-coach team led to him being sidelined. A fine fielder, he took some spectacular catches, usually in the slips. On retiring in 1998, he became Central Districts' coaching director and then coach, but at the end of 2003-04 he quit New Zealand, frustrated with salaries and opportunities, and took over as coach of Giggleswick School in Yorkshire. In 2005 he moved to Warwickshire to head up their academy, and at the end of the summer was appointed as county coach on a three-year contract. Greatbatch did not complete his term with the club, and after leaving in 2007 he was appointed as an advisor to New Zealand's selection panel. That role, and a mini crisis after Andy Moles abruptly departed from the head coach's role in late 2008, saw Greatbatch take over in January 2010.",

    "text": "This chapter introduces some best secure coding practices for developers writing Debian packages. If you are really interested in secure coding I recommend you read David Wheeler's Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO and Secure Coding: Principles and Practices by Mark G. Graff and Kenneth R. van Wyk (O'Reilly, 2003).\nDevelopers that are packaging software should make a best effort to ensure that the installation of the software, or its use, does not introduce security risks to either the system it is installed on or its users.\nIn order to do so, they should make their best to review the source code of the package and detect any flaws that might introduce security bugs before releasing the software or distributing a new version. It is acknowledged that the cost of fixing bugs grows for different stages of its development, so it is easier (and cheaper) to fix bugs when designing than when the software has been deployed and is in maintenance mode (some studies say that the cost in this later phase is sixty times higher). Although there are some tools that try to automatically detect these flaws, developers should strive to learn about the different kind of security flaws in order to understand them and be able to spot them in the code they (or others) have written.\nThe programming bugs which lead to security bugs typically include: buffer overflows, format string overflows, heap overflows and integer overflows (in C/C++ programs), temporary symlink race conditions (in scripts), directory traversal and command injection (in servers) and cross-site scripting, and SQL injection bugs (in the case of web-oriented applications). For a more complete information on security bugs review Fortify's Taxonomy of Software Security Errors.\nSome of these issues might not be easy to spot unless you are an expert in the programming language the software uses, but some security problems are easy to detect and fix. For example, finding temporary race conditions due to misuse of temporary directories can easily be done just by running grep -r \"/tmp/\" .. Those calls can be reviewed and replace the hardcoded filenames using temporary directories to calls to either mktemp or tempfile in shell scripts, File::Temp(3perl) in Perl scripts, or tmpfile(3) in C/C++.\nThere are a set of tools available to assist to the security code review phase. These include rats, flawfinder and pscan. For more information, read the list of tools used by the Debian Security Audit Team.\nThe package does install binaries setuid or setgid. Lintian will warn of setuid, setgid and setuid and setgid binaries.\nProgrammed (i.e., cron) tasks running in the system do NOT run as root or, if they do, do not implement complex tasks.\nFor more information, specific to secure programming, make sure you read (or point your upstream to) Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO and the Build Security In portal.\nIf your software runs a daemon that does not need root privileges, you need to create a user for it. There are two kind of Debian users that can be used by packages: static uids (assigned by base-passwd, for a list of static users in Debian see Operating system users and groups, Section 12.1.12) and dynamic uids in the range assigned to system users.\nIn the first case, you need to ask for a user or group id to the base-passwd. Once the user is available there the package needs to be distributed including a proper versioned depends to the base-passwd package.\nIn the second case, you need to create the system user either in the preinst or in the postinst and make the package depend on adduser (>= 3.11).\n[ -z \"$SERVER_NAME\" ] && SERVER_NAME=\"Server description\"\n# Groups that the user will be added to, if undefined, then none.\necho -n \"Adding group $SERVER_GROUP..\"\necho -n \"Adding system user $SERVER_USER..\"\nStarts the daemon dropping privileges: if the software does not do the setuid(2) or seteuid(2) call itself, you can use the --chuid call of start-stop-daemon.\nStops the daemon only if the user id matches, you can use the start-stop-daemon --user option for this.\nIf the package creates the system user it can remove it when it is purged in its postrm. This has some drawbacks, however. For example, files created by it will be orphaned and might be taken over by a new system user in the future if it is assigned the same uid. Consequently, removing system users on purge is not yet mandatory and depends on the package needs. If unsure, this action could be handled by asking the administrator for the prefered action when the package is installed (i.e. through debconf).\necho -n \"Removing $CREATEDUSER system user..\"\necho -n \"Removing $CREATEDGROUP group..\"\nRunning programs with a user with limited privileges makes sure that any security issue will not be able to damage the full system. It also follows the principle of least privilege. Also consider you can limit privileges in programs through other mechanisms besides running as non-root. For more information, read the Minimize Privileges chapter of the Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO book.",

    "text": "Reading about new features is great, but finding data to test them out on is sometimes troublesome. As DBAs, we\u2019ve created test databases countless times, but the majority of the time they are empty.\nOracle does provide sample schemas that can be installed automatically by using the database configuration assistant (DBCA) when creating a database or manually by executing scripts under the Oracle software home directory. Consult the documentation of your particular version for more details. While these sample schemas do provide a framework that mimics a common layout, they lack the volume of data that typical production systems have. If your employer allows \u201csandboxes\u201d to be created to test new versions and features then you can stop reading here because you are one of the fortunate ones. However, if you do not have this opportunity but would still like to create a sizeable data set to work with, there is a utility called Swingbench that fills this need very well.\nSwingbench was created by Dominic Giles (http://dominicgiles.com/index.html) as an Oracle database load generator, but has since become a very useful suite of tools including Data Generator, Trace Analyzer, and several monitoring tools. Best of all, these tools are free to use. I would recommend that you provide a small donation if you find them useful, though.\nQuoting the creator, \u201cData Generator is a utility to populate, create, and load tables with semi random data. Users can specify sequences, random text, random numbers, database columns, and files as sources for tables.\u201d This sounds pretty good.\nSwingbench requires Java 8 JDK. Download the jdk-8u111-linux-x64.rpm and install it (as the root user) with the command: \u201crpm -Uvh jdk-8u111-linux-x64.rpm\u201d. Note that this file is for the 64-bit version of OEL.\nDownload the swingbench25971.zip file for version 2.5 from the website mentioned previously and place it in a location where the oracle user account has read, write, and execute privileges.\nGo to the swingbench/bin directory. You have the option to create the sales history schema (shwizard), the calling center schema (ccwizard), or the order entry schema (oewizard).\nAfter clicking Next, you have the option to create or drop your desired schema.\nFor the connection string, use //<servername>/<database_sid>. Make sure you can ping the host by the <servername> used and that there is a listener present providing service for the <database_sid>. Leave the connection type as the default (jdbc thin). Leave DBA username as \u2018sys as sysdba\u2019 and make sure the password is correct. Press Next to connect.\nIf the connection is successful, you will see the next screen where you can choose the username, password, schema tablespace, and tablespace datafile of your data set schema. I like to keep my data separated for easier management, so I elect to create a separate tablespace and datafile.\nThe next screen allows you to choose database options such as partitioning (range or none), compression (yes or no), tablespace type (bigfile or normal), and indexing (all, primary key, or none). Be careful here. Do not select options that you are not licensed for in systems that are eligible for license audits.\nSizing options come next. I don\u2019t suppose I need to tell you not to size your schema any bigger than you have space available. What is good here is that two counters at the bottom will let you know the size of the schema tablespace and the size of the temp tablespace required based on your selection. Click next when you are done.\nFinally, select the level of parallelism and click finish to create your schema.\nOnce the build is over, you should see a \u201csuccessful\u201d message popup window. Click Ok to acknowledge the message and close the window. You then have the option to review the wizard log in the wizard log window or save it to a file. Close both the wizard log and main wizard windows after you are done.\nAt this point, you have the option to generate other data sets if you want to. Enjoy.\nSequences are not gap free!\nYesterday I encountered a trace file on a \u201cpoorly-performing\u201d process with some interesting waits. The trace was incomplete because the trace process was started once the process was identified as \u201cpoorly-performing\u201d. Even so, it was interesting.\n0\u00a0 user\u00a0 SQL statements in trace file.\n2\u00a0 internal SQL statements in trace file.\n2\u00a0 SQL statements in trace file.\n2\u00a0 unique SQL statements in trace file.\n384089\u00a0 lines in trace file.\n1507\u00a0 elapsed seconds in trace file.\nOk, we have 1507 seconds of tracing, or slightly over 25 minutes. Of that, only .08 seconds are accounted for between the recursive (system) and non-recursive (user) statements. Where did the time go? There were no event waits under the non-recursive statements section, but the wait events for the recursive statements was very telling. Note that this is not a complete listing, I just filtered out any waits that did not add up to more than 1 second.\nWe now see that about 1211 seconds, or about 20 minutes of the trace, was spent on \u201cenq: SV \u2013 contention\u201d. But what is that? This event is sequence value (SV) contention and appears when there is a high demand for sequence values across multiple instances in a RAC environment. I typically see \u201clog file sync\u201d waits that point to sequence contention issues in non-RAC environments.\nWhen sequences are created they have a default cached value of 20. This means that every time a sequence is accessed, the next 20 values are cached in memory for quick access. This value needs to be much higher when the sequence is used to generate values for inserts when hundreds of thousands or millions of records are inserted in one process or routine.\nI always recommend increasing the size of the sequence cache values when I see these type of situations, but I am often met with one of two very weak arguments. One is that the client does not want to have to recreate the sequences to increase the cache value while the other is that the client wants to keep the cache small in order to avoid gaps in sequence values. Let\u2019s take these arguments one at a time.\nFirst, altering the sequence cache value dynamically has been available since Oracle database version 10g release 1. In fact, there is a quote in the Oracle 10g release 1 SQL reference guide which states \u201cOracle recommends using the CACHE setting to enhance performance if you are using sequences in a Real Application Clusters environment.\u201d The rest of this argument is disproved by creating a test sequence and changing the cache value with a simple \u201calter sequence\u201d command.\nThe second argument is the most exasperating for me because the client usually won\u2019t budge from their position. Although the client is correct when they state that a smaller cache size reduces the risk of sequence value gaps, they are mistaken when they assume that a reduced cache will ensure no sequence gaps.\nIf you are relying on sequences to generate primary keys for newly-inserted records, there is NO guarantee that there will be no sequence value gaps. Even Tom Kyte is in agreement here (https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:29059659958024).\nBecause I did not commit some newly-inserted records before the instance crashed, they were not written to the table even though the sequence incremented and created a gap in the key values of the table. Even if you have a batch process that commits after every record inserted, you can\u2019t account for instance crashes.\nIf you STILL intend to use a sequence alone to generate a \u201cno gap\u201d primary key, what happens if you have to delete records from the table? Guess what, you now have gaps in your primary key values. What are you going to do, re-index all the remaining records to remove the gaps? I doubt it. The best bet is to use the sequence and one or more other values in the table, perhaps even a timestamp, as the basis for a primary key value. This way, you can increase the sequence cache and still have solid primary keys. You just need to get over the \u201cno gap sequence values\u201d idea.",

    "text": "Almost all the Axis LMS reports and tables revolve around users; a user\u2019s purchases, a user\u2019s scores, which users belong to which manager. These reports also allow the report viewer to apply filters, narrowing their results down to users from a specific position, company, by manager, and countless other criteria. But these fields don\u2019t fill themselves out.\nA User\u2019s Dashboard is the central hub for all of that user\u2019s data. From here, you can reset their password, assign managers, manage their courses; groups; variables, and pull up all of their reports; both historical and current.\nFrom this page, you can also quickly pull up some important information about the user, such as their Name, Login ID, Email Address, and their current Active/Inactive status in the system.\nThe User Profile is where data unique to the user is stored; this includes their first and last name, as well as fields specific to your company, and private notes about the user.\nThe \"General Info\u201d tab hosts common fields, such as first / last name, and address. Switching to the \"Customized Fields\u201d tab allows you to store company-specific fields - re-namable fields that which the admin may use to store information about the user which is more specific to their company or used for their own business practices.\nWhile on the \"General Info\u201d tab, you\u2019re also able to manually change the user\u2019s interface language to any of the different language packs installed on your system.\nThe \"Notes & Other\u201d tab stores an editable historical activation / deactivation record for the user, as well as a section allowing the admin to change the user\u2019s login ID.\nThe Password Reset icon allows the admin to revert the user\u2019s login password back to an Axis LMS temporary password (and optionally send the user an email with their new password).\nIf you\u2019ve chosen to utilize Managers on your Axis Learning Management system, you\u2019ll want to begin in a user\u2019s Role & Topology. From this area, you\u2019re able to designate a user\u2019s role [Learner / Manager], and their superiors.\nThe \"Topology Path\u201d tab shows where the user currently lays in their hierarchal tree - who their Manager is, and which users report to them.\nThe \"Role\u201d tab lets you designate if this user is able to have users below them or not. \u2018Learners\u2019 only report to Managers or the admin; \u2018Managers\u2019 can both report, and be reported to.\nThe \"Manager\u201d tab provides you a method to designate this user\u2019s primary manager (who they directly report to).\nThe user\u2019s dashboard also allows the admin to Manage the Usergroups and Courses / Course Groups the user is participating in.\nUsergroups are a tremendous help when filtering your reports. Usergroups can be systematically assigned through Event Triggers and upon import (among other methods); but this page is useful for manually adding or removing an individual user from these groups.\nWhen managing a user\u2019s courses, you\u2019re able to set both start and end dates for the user in that course(s), as well as (optionally) send them an enrollment email. Courses, similarly to Usergroups, can be systematically assigned to users through Event Triggers and upon import; but this page is an excellent method to manually enroll or disenroll users from a course.\nLearn more about Courses in this article.\nThe manage KeyCodes area allows the Admin, or a Manager, to utilize a KeyCode on a user\u2019s behalf. KeyCodes enroll users into courses for specific durations of time, and while they may be redeemed by the user through specific widgets, this is a more hands-off approach for the user.\nWhen managing a user\u2019s certification, the admin (or a manager) is able to manually create, import, export, filter and print, or inspect any of a user\u2019s certifications.\nTo create a new certification for a user, click the green addition symbol. When adding a new certification, you\u2019ll be asked to select what kind of certification this is, the certification number, the date it was earned, and when it should expire.\nWhen selecting what type of certification this is, you can optionally select one of the existing certification programs you have set up. By selecting an existing certification program, a lot of the information will automatically generate upon saving - using that certification program\u2019s data.\nFor Example: if you do not assign a certification number now, Axis LMS will automatically create one using the same logic it does to create other certifications for the corresponding program. If you choose to enter the certification in as a 3rd party certification (meaning - there is no existing online certification program set up for it), the user will not be able to systematically renew this certification inside of Axis LMS - a certification program will need to be created which allows the user to accrue CEU credits towards re-certification.\nTo import certifications for a user, select the import/cloud icon from the Manage Certifications area, then follow the prompts and guidelines spelled out in the importer.\nAfter a user has earned at least one certification, it will appear in their Manage Certifications area with a magnifying glass icon next to it. This will allow you to pull up a read-only view of that certification. This view will allow you to see which program the certification is associated with (if any), the certification number, how it was earned (entered by Admin versus earned in the system), and the user\u2019s recertification window. It will also show the CEUs that the user has earned towards their recertification.\nWhen Managing a User\u2019s CEU Credits, the admin (or a manager) is able to manually create, import, export, filter and print, or inspect any of a user\u2019s CEU Credits.\nTo add a new CEU credit, click the green addition symbol. When adding a new CEU credit, you\u2019ll be asked to select how the credit(s) were earned, the number of credits earned, and the date they were earned.\nSelecting an online course from the drop down will award the user those credits as though they had completed that selected online course. Those credits will follow all the rules of that online course including which CEU group(s) that course is a part of. When selecting a course, Axis LMS will identify how many CEU credits that course is set up to award (by populating the credits earned text box with that value), which the administrator (or manager) can take as a suggestion before completing the CEU creation process. The completion date is an optional field; if it is not filled out, Axis LMS will use the current date for the credits.\nThere are very few circumstances that would warrant the admin having to go in and edit a user\u2019s Trigger Data, but when those scenarios do arise, it\u2019s important that the admin be able to make it right.\nTrigger data refers to two fields of data that are otherwise invisible and out of the way - these are the Course Tracking variables, and System Tracking variables. These are customizable fields which allow the admin to tick up or down, then compare against using other Event Triggers.\nThere are a handful of pre-constructed system tracking variables, listed below.\nAccessibility mode allows a specific user to access your content in a way that is capable of adhering to section 508 compliance. Turning this on for a user will drastically change their user experience.\nTo read more about Section 508 Compliance in Axis LMS, check out this article.\nWhen Resetting a User, you are resetting and archiving their current score in one (or many) of their Axis LMS courses. This is a complete wipe of their data, and is irreversible; after resetting the user in a course, the next time they log into that course, they will have 0% progress and 0% average - they have never been in the course before.",

    "text": "Today\u2019s selection of words are magic: incantations that summon mysterious powers and set spells in motion. Nowadays they\u2019re all considered rather childish and funny, but they come from a variety of original sources. And once again we have a lot of interesting etymological theories, with a lot of question marks to go with them.\nhocus-pocus - Dating from the early seventeenth century as a magical formula used in conjuring, the word was apparently first a stage name used by \u201cjugglers\u201d or magicians. It may be a corruption of the sacramental blessing from Catholic Mass \u201cHoc est corpus\u2026\u201d Support for this theory comes from the equivalent phrases in other European languages, which also appear to be corruptions of elements of Catholic ritual. But it may derive instead from the pseudo-Latin phrase \u201cHax pax max Deus adimax,\u201d also used as a magic formula. Or it may be from \u201cOchus Bochus,\u201d a Norse magician and demon of folklore. Or perhaps it was just random nonsense, with the full phrase given in 1656 as \u201cHocus pocus, tontus talontus, vade celeriter jubeo.\u201d In any case, it seems to have been made up by performers with no belief in actual magical powers.\nmumbo-jumbo - First used in 1738 and alleged to be the name of an idol worshipped in Africa, the phrase may or may not come from the Mandingo name Maamajomboo described in the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1803. By English speakers this phrase came to be used to mean \u201can object of senseless veneration or a meaningless ritual.\u201d As a word in English, therefore, it was never intended to be taken seriously by magician or audience, and is indicative of magic that we assume to be false.\nOpen, sesame! - Speaking of the mystical East, this phrase comes, as you probably know, from the story of Ali Baba in the Arabian Nights. Its first appearance is in Antoine Galland\u2019s Les Mille et une nuits from 1704-17, whence it was translated into English. Interestingly, Galland is the one who added the story when he first translated the story collection One Thousand and One Nights, so although he may have heard it from a storyteller in Syria, no earlier form of the story has been found. So, why sesame? Unknown, of course, but possibilities include a rare literary word in Arabic that\u2019s the same sound as sesame (simsim in Arabic) but which means \u201cgate.\u201d Or a reduplication of the Hebrew sem meaning \u201cname,\"\nthus being a kabbalistic reference to God. Or that certain Babylonian magic practices made use of sesame oil. Or who knows what. In any case, Ali Baba\u2019s dim brother takes the meaning at face value and, when he can\u2019t remember the password, guesses various other seeds: \u201cOpen, barley! Open, chick-peas!\u201d This would presumably be even funnier to the tale\u2019s original audience if indeed there were some particular magical significance to the word sesame.\nshazam - Apparently invented in 1940 by Bill Parker for the Captain Marvel comic series. Shazam was explained as an acronym of the first initials of various powerful figures: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. In the comic its utterance turned our Ordinary Guy into our Hero, and it soon became used as an exclamation at a sudden and surprising change or occurrence.\npresto - Going all the way back to the 1590s as part of conjuring patter, it comes from Italian for \u201cquick, quickly.\u201d Now it\u2019s often used in combinations such as \u201cHey presto,\u201d and \u201cPresto-chango.\u201d Interestingly, the same word was borrowed into English again as a musical notation, but not until about 1683.\nGutenberg wasn\u2019t the first to print with moveable type. The nearest comparable effort with movable metal type was printed in Korea in 1377.\nThe 42-line Bible wasn\u2019t Gutenberg\u2019s first product. He\u2019d already done some broadsheets and even pamphlets before undertaking the massive production that was the 1286 page, two volume Vulgate Bible.\nink, by hand. After about 10 pages he started spacing his lines a little more closely together so as to fit 42 lines of type per page, thus saving himself about 30 pages per Bible. Later when the print run was enlarged, the extra copies of these initial pages were made to match the rest of the Bible. So, there are versions with some printed rubrication and some without, there are versions with some 40-line pages and some without, there are versions printed on paper and some on vellum, and any hand rubrication and illumination done on each copy will be unique, meaning that no two copies of the Bible are identical, despite its being the first mass-produced book.\nWhen I was in 7th grade I received an \u201cexcellent\u201d award at the district competition of National History Day with my project about the invention of the printing press, so obviously I\u2019ve been interested in this stuff for a long time! And in truth, it\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of the technology or how it\u2019s changed and enriched life. But despite the continuing advances in information dissemination, there\u2019s still something especially beautiful and magical about the pressing of ink onto paper, one sheet at a time.\nWe saw lots of lovely mythical beasts in Ireland! It\u2019s worth noting that with ancient depictions of creatures, especially medieval and earlier, it\u2019s not always easy to tell the difference between real animals and mythical ones. Note, for example, the wonderfully bizarre elephant holding up the castle in the first carving. This obviously is the work of an artist who was no more likely to see an elephant than a griffin, and to whom both beasts were equally exotic, improbable, and real. There are many creatures in Celtic artwork that are not readily identifiable. They could be monsters, or they could simply be odd dogs. Even so, fantastical creatures turn up everywhere you look in Celtic art, and I took great pleasure in spotting them on our recent travels.\nI should mention the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow, although between the crowds and the dim lighting it\u2019s nearly impossible to get a good view of the Books in person. I didn\u2019t spot any mythical creatures on the pages that were open for display on the day we went, but I include a couple of illuminated animal selections anyway. The animals in the Book of Kells are mostly real, but the number and charm of them sprinkled everywhere is one of the things that makes this illuminated book unique.\nknotted dragonish creatures. The crozier of Clonmacnoise is supported by gorgeous leonine beasts. And one of my favorites is the wonderful opossummy head on the Cross of Cong. It\u2019s probably not meant to be a mythical creature, but since I certainly can\u2019t identify it, I\u2019ll count it as something cryptoid!\nThis second selection of Irish block prints features scenes of Dublin, and I\u2019ll begin with another piece by Paula Pohli, whose work I shared last week, as well. This one is a contrast from her dramatic dolmen view, and it sticks to black and white, with an emphasis on all the different geometric patterns of the city (plus the wigglier texture of the water.) I really like the variety of lines and rectangles, some black on white, some white on black. Somehow the completely plain, blank white sky reads as gently overcast, which is right for Ireland.\nNext, for contrast, is a black sky, perhaps a clear night. This is a view of Trinity College by Mary Grey. The foreground looks almost abstract, while edges of the roof melt into the background. Yet despite the lack of precise detail in this piece, the circles and stars of the bicycle wheels lined up along the front of the building make a fun and beautiful detail.\nThe third piece, by Mary Plunkett, is an illustration of one of the stories in James Joyce\u2019s Dubliners. It\u2019s titled after the line \u201cshe heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses..\u201d I confess that I don\u2019t know the story, or why these houses aren\u2019t red! Perhaps there\u2019s some special significance in the interesting viewpoint of this street, with the two sides sprouting away in both directions. Note the typical Dublin fanlight arches over all the doors, even if these have no tracery details and are more modest than the famous Georgian show houses. They\u2019re very simple, without any signs of life - no plants or flowers, no curtains in the windows. This adds to the emptiness and unreality of the street. In fact, all three of these pieces show a Dublin devoid of people. In terms of art that\u2019s just fine with me - I usually prefer my landscapes people-free, but you have to admit it\u2019s a pretty unrealistic image of the bustling, buzzy city of Dublin!\nThis month marks the 180th anniversary of the publication of Sir John Herschel\u2019s most extraordinary discoveries, including the invention of a new telescope 24 feet in diameter and with a hydro-oxygen microscope lens that allowed him to see the surface of the moon in unprecedented detail. Indeed, it allowed him to discover life on the moon. The life that was reported included red flowers covering the surface of the rock, bison, bluish grey goats, and an amphibious spherical creature which rolled with great velocity. Even more extraordinary, Herschel saw tribes of biped beavers that lived in huts and had mastered the use of fire, and finally the Vespertilio-homo, winged humanoids covered with glossy, copper-colored hair.\nYowza! These amazing discoveries received widespread press, and created much excitement, as you can imagine. So how is it that you\u2019ve never heard of these discoveries? Well, obviously, it all turned out to be a hoax. (Oops, I guess I gave it away in the title of this post.) It was, however, one of the greatest and most successful popular scientific hoaxes of all time, and in 1835 perhaps the first mass-media event, driven by the high circulation of the New York Sun with its steam-powered printing presses and its innovative use of newsboys shouting out headlines for all to hear. Poor Herschel, who was in South Africa at the time, had nothing to do with the hoax. Apparently he was initially amused when he heard about it, but eventually became irritated at perpetually being pestered about it.\nIf you want to know all the details about the hoax, its reception, its author, and the history of the newspaper business which made it possible, check out this article from the Museum of Hoaxes. One interesting thing about it is that even the many skeptics seem to have enjoyed the story as fiction, rather than being outraged by the inaccuracy and downright dishonesty of the New York Sun. It seems that the tabloids have always been more about entertainment than truth, and at least exciting science fiction stories are better entertainment than slanderous gossip about unhappy celebrities. Just hold onto your skepticism when the popular press announces the discovery of biped beavers on Pluto!\nThis summer we\u2019ll be going to Ireland - I\u2019m so excited! To get in the spirit I\u2019ve collected some block prints of Irish scenes. (I\u2019m very much hoping to get material for some future Irish block prints of my own, of course.) I\u2019ll begin today with scenes from the western side of Ireland. First, two by Gail Kelly, who works in County Down in Northern Ireland, but who has prints depicting many places in Ireland. First, a scene of Connemara, which is roughly the western part of County Galway. I especially like the texture of the sky and water. This piece has lovely light.\nThe second of Kelly\u2019s pieces shows a dolmen in County Donegal. We won\u2019t be making it to Donegal, but we will be seeing plenty of dolmens and other archaeology. The juxtaposition of the prehistoric monument right across from the modern village is one of the things that makes Ireland so special: it wears its thousands of years of history on its sleeve, and everywhere you go the past rises up in stone.\nI found another block print of a Dolmen, this one by Paula Pohli, whom I take to be working out of Dublin. Her dolmen is clearly in the Burren, an area in County Clare that\u2019s just peppered with neolithic sites. The ground composed of slabs of limestone is the Burren\u2019s geological trademark. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the dolmen being in red. It certainly gives it a dramatic punch, and without it the grey stones of the dolmen would blend in with the grey stones of the Burren. But it also reminds me of the paperback cover of a cheap shocker! I do like the darker grey sky, though, and the vertical format is an interesting choice.\nI\u2019m late with my post and even later to celebrate the International Day of Friendship which is set by the United Nations as July 30. However, it turns out that many countries celebrate Friendship Day on the first Sunday in August, so I\u2019m right on target after all! And in honor of international friendship, here are words for \u201cfriend\u201d in lots of different languages. To make it more interesting, I\u2019ve grouped them so that you can see some cognates. Cognates, in case I\u2019ve never mentioned it before, are words in different languages that share similarities of sound and meaning because they derive from the same ancestral word. (For languages with different writing systems, I\u2019ve given the Romanization so you can get the gist of the pronunciation. I also apologize for lack of diacritical marks on many of these words. I don\u2019t know how to type them!) Of course plenty of languages, like English, have more than one word for \u201cfriend,\u201d but here I\u2019ve simply listed the one that came up first in the dictionary. And of course the last group is all the words that don\u2019t share any other cognates on my list.\nOne thing that\u2019s especially interesting about the words humans use for \u201cfriend,\u201d is the variety of etymologies. Many come from roots having to do with love, including friend, amigo, filos, and cara. Bengali bandhu comes from \u201cto tie,\u201d while Arabic sadiq comes from \u201cto tell the truth.\u201d The Japanese and Latvian words come from roots having to do with company. There are languages whose words for friendship come from \u201csharing,\u201d and others that come from \u201ccaring.\u201d In short, there are many facets to friendship, and many ways we can talk about it. But don\u2019t just talk - go out and do something about it!",

Well, unusual in the sense that this fight is from 1995 and it sure as heck looks like someone in the crowd is using a smartphone.\nThe evidence: at one point during the fight, a spectator held up a big white square thing that had a camera lens on it. In 2016, that sounds like someone is using an iPhone, a Galaxy, or something similar. But in 1995, cell phones were pretty uncommon, and those who had cell phones didn\u2019t have devices with cameras in them yet.\nThat absolutely, positively looks like someone is holding up a smartphone. Not just because it looks like a phone, but when you\u2019re taking pictures of something on a stage (or, in this case, in a boxing ring) you have to hold your phone up like that.\nBut you know what? We\u2019re going to go ahead and guess that this is time travel, regardless. So if you\u2019re the person with the smartphone in this video, do us a favor and go into the future next time. We really want to know if theFloyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor superfight actually happens, and also if you can hook me up with the Powerball numbers for every week from now until 2050, that would be awesome.",

    "text": "Good news everyone, according to the geniuses at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), the UK is beginning to emerge from the cold, hard winter of economic discontent known as the \u2018great recession\u2019, and is due to return to its pre-recession peak of 2008.\nThis is obviously good news for all. I don\u2019t think I need to spell out to you the importance of economic stability and rising employment to the recruitment industry.\nIf the NIESR\u2019s report highlights anything to us, however, it is that per capita GDP is still well below pre-recession levels, and so \u2018how rich individuals are\u2019 will take some time to recover. The important thing to recruiters here is that high-billing jobs are not going to become so abundant just yet, and so stresses the importance for consultants to focus on the number of placements made.\nWith this economic good news in mind, we at idibu decided to compile statistics on the number of jobs posted and the number of applications made, comparing Q1 2013 to Q1 2014. idibu\u2019s multi-posting software is designed to make accessing data simple and efficient due to all recruitment practices being centralised in one, easy to use system.\nAs you can see, this is in-keeping with an upturn in economic activity. What is interesting here is the rate of jobs posted is higher than the rate of applications, which could be explained by a decrease in unemployment.\nOf course, data such as this can help you focus your business activity according to your particular strengths. It can highlight areas where you need to be more time efficient and make your recruitment practice run a lot smoother.\nGiven that we have access to global statistics of this nature, we have begun collating and analysing data for our clients to be distributed in the coming weeks. We call this the idibu Index. This information can help you focus your business according to increases in job availability in each sector; the number of available applicants in each sector; the focus on specific job boards; the ability to reach the best candidates by posting at the appropriate time of the day. The idibu Index will give our clients what they need to sharpen their business practice: appropriate and applicable market information.",

    "text": "I have to say Wow! Shocked this is a really nice blockset, congratulations!\nI have a question: is CAN support in the roadmap?\nI do not use CAN bus in my project due to its complex electronics.\nRight now, I do not plan to build the CAN blockset since the documentation is very long and that it will take me quite a lot of time to achieve the user interface for all the options available.\nSo, depending how many people ask for it, I will read carefully the CAN chapter. But I guess that most people use SPI or I2C bus for small distance communication with fixed ground reference voltage.\nIts worth developing the CAN driver blocks as its is widely used. SPI and I2C are ok for on board devices like A/D etc, but CAN is far superior for noisy enviroments and long cable runs.\nI would also like to see some CAN modules as CAN is widely used and will be in the industrie for some years to come.\nI work with CAN intensivly and have a CAN test bench with a couple off CAN nodes on a Bus .\nIf it would help you I can help you in testing and running the code generated from the toolbox in realtime for you or supply you with the CAN basics which you may need .\nThis is just a offer that could help us to generate the modules for the toolbox.\nCAN peripheral is available on current version of the dsPIC blockset. I will write the doccumentation soon.\nECAN is not available yet. Is anybody interrested by ECAN ?\nWe are very interested indeed in getting an ECAN block working.\nthat's what we will be offering our customers.\ninteroperability with (e.g.) CANdb support in MathWorks.\nYes I second that. ECAN Please !!\nVery interested in ECAN. Hope it will come soon.Thanks Lubin!\nI would also like to vote for supporting ECAN. I have the 33f with ECAN and would like to be able to use it as a block.\nIt seems like a few different people are looking for this, are you thinking about developing an ECAN block?\nECAN has lots of possibility and it is still difficult to start to work on it.\nIt's even more difficult now because I'm writing my PhD report and have some change planned in my private life (getting married soon).\nI will start to works on it as soon as I can get enough free time.\nLast edited by bmairs on Sat Dec 10, 2011 1:47 am, edited 1 time in total.\nIt would be very interresting to get an ECAN module compatible with the blockset.\nI try to have a close look within few weeks (2 or 3) and provide my comments.\nI've fixed the repo. Should be publicly clonable. I'll try and add more documentation to it within the week to clear up some things.\nI just wanted to update this thread briefly.\nI'm currently stuck on an Embedded MATLAB block issue where it doesn't want to respect an infinite sampling time. After that is fixed, there blockset should be close to if not fully functional.\nthat is great news, I am really looking forward to that as I will need ECAN soon to implement in my project (I am now waiting for some parts delivery, and PCB to be made) so in few weeks if not days I will be able to test. In case you need some help testing or so, I hope I will be able to help.\nI didn't get time yet to have a close look into the code.\nAnyway, I will try to do it.\nare there any news? I have run in some problems with communication (UART is not enough ). I would like to try ECAN. Should I try using your code (or try to make mine), or should I wait?\nWhat do you mean by UART is not enough ?\nI would advise to use it.\nI couldn't give date as I always have to postpone it, but this is in the pipe anyway ! I hope to do it soon !\nIt's very good news from Lubin and Bryant.\nBut, if your deadline is very short, maybe you better have to build a multipoint with the Uart and some RS422 / RS485 tranceivers.\nIf the speed at 921600kbaud/s is enough sure.\nAnyway... I have noticed new toolbox version, thanks for the debugging support! I will start with the ECAN part of my project now, as there is a new uC unit for the BUS. I have less than 2 months now to finish my project and write my diploma work... uff.\nThe function 'gcb' is not supported by Embedded MATLAB for code generation. See the documentation for eml.extrinsic to learn how you can use this function in simulation.\nI have noticed similar behavior with I2C: my colleague is implementing I2C, He is not using I2C part of the block-set for sending and reading data, but he is using C-call. When we compiled through matlab, there was a problem with reading sequence, but when we used generated c code in MPLAB project, it started working! I do not have the code now on me to post it, but I am starting to think, that the problem may be somewhere in the compilation process, perhaps some argument settings for calling the MPLAB?\nLast edited by Bobes on Tue Apr 06, 2010 11:17 pm, edited 1 time in total.\nYou may compare the configuration bits.\nWhat if you compile/run in MPLAB with release mode ?\nI often noticed very weird behavious using MPLAB debugger. Thus, I usually avoid using it.\nIf more option are required in the blockset for the compilation process, just let me know !\nIf I read interpret those values correctly: according to section 25: bit 23-8 are Unimplemented, therefore there should be no difference between 00FF and FFFF hmm.. that is just 16 bits?\n7 bit: Reserved, do not use. ?!\nLet me know how to force first 8 bits of FSS to 0.\nI have some further problems with buffers, I have started using more Rx and Tx blocks, Rx seems fine, but I dont see where to set Rx block for buffer which stores filtered data... Does the filter -> buffer feature work?\non Tx: when I set Tx buffers 1 2 3, and then for three Tx blocks use 1 2 and 3 it sends empty messages (only header, no data), I have all set to one buffer now, and that works, but the messages are not send at the rate they are supposed to. I have no (or couple) errors on the line.\nI am using blocks from the example with circ buffer.\nSo I recently went through and updated my ECAN code. I also actively use these blocks, so it's known to be good. Link is here: https://github.com/Susurrus/ECAN_dspic. Just add it to your Matlab path as another library and you're good to go.\nbmairs wrote: So I recently went through and updated my ECAN code.

Just add it to your Matlab path as another library and you're good to go.\nHello, I'm having a look at you blockset. I have C30 v3.23 and C32 v1.05 installed, with Matlab 2010a. Trying your two examples 'out of the box' I notice that a device which is targeted by the pic30 compiler failes to build because your code uses includes from the pic32 compiler (and vice versa). Does the toolbox require the new Microchip compiler ( I forget what it's called) which I understand targets all parts?\nI'm a bit wary of having to upgrade the microchip tools in case it breaks somthing in Lubin's blockset. If anyone is using te ECAN code (and the dsPIC blockset) succesfully I would appreciate it if you could list the versions of the tools that you're using.\nHas anyone used bmairs ECAN blockset with a dsPIC33FJ256MC710 device?\nI've spent a couple of days trying to transmit over CAN from the PIC with no success. I can transmit using the microchip code that accompanies AN1249 so I know that the hardware is OK.\nI'm not sure if I'm doing something stupid or if there is a problem with bmairs code. If anyone has succesfully used it I'd appreciate a copy of a simple simulink model (that transmits) that is know to work so that I can see if it works with my setup.",

    "text": "Large banks have become synonymous with the words \u2018scandal\u2019, and \u2018manipulation\u2019 in recent years. Since the emergence of the Global Financial Crisis in 2007/08, several large banks were discovered to be committing large-scale malpractice, fraud or miss-selling of financial products \u2014 for the purpose of reducing costs and raising profits.\nSince 2008, the activities for the UK\u2019s five largest banks alone, have led to over \u00a325 billion in fines levied upon them by various regulatory agencies around the world including the UK\u2019s very own Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nThe exact nature of the banks\u2019 wrongdoing is wide-ranging and multifaceted which has led to an unprecedented level of intra-national co-operation between the worlds\u2019 financial regulatory authorities such as the FCA, NFA, CFTC, ASIC, BoJ, FinMin and BaFin.\nPlease note this content is for informational purposes only and may not constitute as legal advice. The information provided here is based on online research. If any mistake has been made, please let us know over the comment section.\nDuncan Lawrie has been hit by occasional instances where some individual accounts were hacked into. In addition, Duncan Lawrie has been known to provide personalised banking services to many people who had been engaged in LIBOR rate-fixing activities in the past. The bank has not been found to be directly involved or responsible for any of the actions that some of its members have engaged in though.\nFrom the dozens of available asset classes available to investors, banks were found to be taking part in illegal activities in some more than others.\nClient reporting, residential mortgages, loan securitisations and rate setting were the four areas banks were least compliant, according to regulators.\nRegardless of the territory, there\u2019s been a bank conducting some form of malfeasance there over the past decade \u2014 and the worrying thing \u2014 is that banks\u2019 behaviour has not changed in any meaningful way to curb the level of market abuse and manipulation.\nBanks have been embroiled in several market sectors when conducting their market abuse. Of the officially confirmed abuses, the following asset classes/markets were confirmed to have been severely impaired by banks\u2019 behaviour.\nAll of the above asset classes have been used by banks to either reduce the level of operational cost(s) or to market-make markets in their favour for preferential pricing and fees. Here are the highlights of the past decades\u2019 market abuses, as claimed by regulatory agencies.\nBarclays and Citigroup were the hardest hit from a regulatory backlash perspective although both banks continue to operate thriving FX businesses to this day.\nAdditional information on the FCA fines and activity may be found on our FCA page.\nThe CFTC cites how \u201cbanks failed to adequately assess the risks associated with their FX traders participating in the fixing of certain FX benchmark rates and lacked adequate internal controls in order to prevent improper communications by traders.\u201d The worst hit bank from the synchronised FX-rigging regulatory backlash in 2014 was UBS, reaping in excess of $800 million in fines.\nThe Swiss giant is the only bank to be fined by three separate regulators in three different countries in a single day.\nFINMA found that over an extended period of time the bank\u2019s employees in Zurich attempted to manipulate foreign exchange benchmarks. In addition, employees acted against the interests of their clients. For these indiscretions, FINMA fined UBS 134 million Swiss francs in confiscation of costs avoided and profits.\nin individual cases engaged in deception regarding sales mark ups and excessive mark ups associated with an internal product of the bank.\nSeveral large top-tier banks consequently beefed up their litigation war chests, although the nominal value of the fines levied remains disproportionally small compared to the market impact of their abusive market activities.\nIn recent announcements, top-tier banks such as UBS, Barclays, Deutsche, HSBC and Citigroup have all reported increases in their litigation allocations and have warned shareholders that litigation costs will remain elevated at best for the foreseeable future given the range of manipulation and malpractice cases that have hit the largest banks over the past five years.\nVarious banks have been penalised for mortgage market malpractices, interest rate derivative fixing and LIBOR manipulation, just a few examples of penalties applied in response to widespread impropriety found to be occurring at Tier 1 banks.\nOne of the biggest debacles during (and since) the GFC has been Mortgages \u2014 otherwise known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\nSometime after the GFC, it was discovered that prior to 2007, many of the world\u2019s largest banks had been using sophisticated securitisation methods to package junk-level debt into AAA-rated securities comparable to US Treasuries.\nThis imbalance was rubber stamped by credit ratings agencies and the newly-created sub-prime \u2018toxic\u2019 assets were presented as clean, wholesome investments investors had little risk of losing their money on.\nThe reality was that these investments were in fact of low value, and when markets priced in the discounts, it was clear that hundreds of billions of dollars were in fact misspent/miss-invested which led to an inevitable rush for the exits and large-scale losses/drawdowns across the investment community.\nBoth Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 stalwart names in the US banking industry \u2014 were forced to become deposit-taking institutions simply to remain solvent.\nThe major consequence of the sub-prime debt bubble was the GFC itself, because of the deep interconnected nature of modern markets. Iceland\u2019s government was forced to default on many of its obligations because of the liabilities its domestic banks had racked up in league with US and UK counterparties.\nBank of America was forced to pay a record $16.7bn (\u00a310bn) to settle allegations that it misled investors into buying toxic mortgage securities. The bank said the \u201cclaims relate primarily to conduct that occurred at Countrywide and Merrill Lynch\u201d before it acquired them during the height of the financial crisis in 2008.\nIn February 2012, Citigroup was one of many banks that agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle charges brought by the US authorities over claims they used abusive methods to foreclose on homeowners hit by the bursting of the country\u2019s property bubble. The agreement saw the banks pay $5bn directly to states in the form of cash fines, $17bn of debt written-off and a further $3bn in lower interest rates to homeowners.\nJP Morgan also paid $5.29 billion under the February 2012 foreclosures settlement, while another US bank, Wells Fargo, paid $5.35 billion. In October 2013, JP Morgan reached a $13bn deal with US regulators to settle claims that it miss-sold bundles of toxic mortgage debt to investors in the build up to the financial crisis.\nThe largest single fine for any one bank in history \u2014 was the $1.9 billion fine levied on HSBC in 2012 for failing to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. HSBC paid almost $2 billion to settle allegations that its failure to enforce anti-money laundering rules left America\u2019s financial system exposed to drug cartels.\nUnconfirmed reports at the time suggested HSBC was actually aware and complicit in helping money sourced from international criminal activity to be funnelled through its network of banks across South America, Africa and Asia.\nIn yet another case of confirmed malpractice affecting thousands of clients, Barclays Bank was fined \u00a337.75 million by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2014 for failing to properly protect clients\u2019 custody assets worth \u00a316.5 billion.\nThe FCA\u2019s fine was the largest of its kind relating to custody assets.\nAccording to the FCA investigation, clients risked \u201cincurring extra costs, lengthy delays or losing their assets if Barclays had become insolvent,\u201d spanning 95 custody accounts in 21 countries. The FCA identified \u201csignificant weaknesses\u201d in how the bank carried out financial services in the \u2018Barclays Investment Banking Division\u2019 between November 2007 and January 2012 \u2013 a period of history dominated by the global financial crisis.\nAppropriate management and real-time accounting of custody assets is often difficult due to liquidity availability and the complexity involved in managing a $16 billion of assets spread across multiple asset classes including property and fine art. The lack of price certainty for some assets was a factor in exacerbating the global financial crisis as market participants were unable to accurately see the true value of their portfolios.\nAmidst fear, panic and market volatility many market participants preferred to sell at the first rate available which in turn fuelled a negative spiral of declining asset prices, more selling and more asset price declines. In 2008 and since, the FCA has communicated on multiple occasions its view of the importance of safeguarding client assets for the good of the bank itself, the wider banking industry and the British economy.\nAccording to the FCA, Barclays did not accurately reflect ownership links within its Investment Banking Division and failed to establish legal agreements on many assets held there. In a further egg-on-face moment, Barclays was found to have claimed ownership rights to assets that actually belonged to clients.\nAs is often the case with brand damaging regulatory penalties, Barclays Bank opted for the FCA\u2019s early-settlement option and qualified for a 30% discount on the fine, saving the bank over \u00a315 million.\nThe full list of defendants in the case consists of major banking institutions: Bank of America; Barclays Bank; Citigroup Inc; Deutsche Bank; BNP Paribas; HSBC Holdings; Royal Bank of Scotland Group; Credit Suisse Group; UBS; Goldman Sachs; Nomura Holdings; Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.\nIn revelations that have an eerie resemblance to the LIBOR fixing scandal, staff working for the 13 accused banks allegedly \u201ccommunicated via private chat rooms\u201d and \u201cused digital communications to \u201csubmit identical quotes beginning at least in 2009\u201d, according to an official statement from the AEPF.\nAlso included in the court case is ICAP Plc, a UK-based broker-dealer clearing over $1.3 trillion in daily transactions. It is alleged that ICAP helped facilitate the manipulation of ISDAfix rates given the company\u2019s prominent and dominant position in clearing transactions in the interest-rate derivatives markets.\nRecorded telephone calls and e-mails reviewed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) show that traders at the thirteen banks instructed ICAP brokers to buy or sell as many interest-rate swaps as necessary to move ISDAfix to a predetermined level.\nAEPF alleges that banks often kept rates artificially low, allowing them to generate substantial profits trading \u2018swaptions\u2019 \u2013 interest derivatives linked to ISDAfix rates.\nDeutsche Bank was fined \u00a35 million for misreporting CFD transactions for almost 5 years between November 2007 and April 2013. Mr. Kai Lew, a Director of Institutional FX at Deutsche, was suspended as part of a manipulation investigation in April 2014.\nLibor, the London inter-bank lending rate, is considered to be one of the most important interest rates in finance, upon which trillions of financial contracts are based on.\nThe LIBOR scandal was the largest in terms of magnitude, and yet the effect on financial markets was felt the least because of its institutional effect.\nLIBOR is generally used by financial intermediaries, for the purpose of setting short-term lending rates. Individuals borrowing money to buy a home would also use LIBOR but the impact on the homeowner is vastly smaller compared to an institution borrowing/lending capital on a daily basis.\nSwiss bank Credit Suisse agreed to pay a $2.6bn fine in May 2014 over allegations that it helped some of its US clients avoid paying taxes.\nIn June 2014, BNP Paribas admitted to processing thousands of transactions through the US financial system on behalf of bodies in Iran, Cuba and Sudan, landing the French bank with an $8.9bn (\u00a35.2bn) fine and leading to the departure of more than a dozen senior employees.\nHave Banks learnt their lesson?\nTo date, not a single employee of any firm has been charged with a criminal offence relating to price fixing of any market, despite dozens of confirmed cases of market manipulation between multiple banks involving dozens of individuals.\nThe effectiveness of ratings agencies and regulators seems to be minimal despite growing powers to regulate and restrict abusive market activity, including large fines.\nThe regulators are either not effective enough or the bankers are too effective. Or in other words, either the regulators are not good enough at their jobs, or the banks are just too good at theirs for lawful business practise to predominate. Gargantuan banks and financial intermediaries remain largely unaccountable and beyond the reach of UK law when it comes to being penalised for wrongdoing, while their overall size and market dominance continue to grow year-on-year, in-line with investor expectations.\nPrior to the 2008 banking crisis, UK banks were only lightly regulated. Since on a global scale only minor regulations were enforced on banks, the regulators worried that banks would simply move abroad if they were too harsh.\nLike any other UK business, banks were subject to regulation by the OFT and the Competition Commission (now the Competition and Markets Authority). In addition, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Bank Of England, and the HM Treasury, all oversaw financial institutions.\nIn 2013, the system was revamped. The FSA was replaced by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is part of the Bank Of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition, the European Banking Authority (EBA) keeps track of the strength of UK and other European banks.\nMoney transfer scams are usually commissioned to law authorities rather than regulators.\nPRA: Prudential regulation of +-1700 financial services institutions, in order to maintain stability.\nFCA: The watchdog that ensures competition is maintained, and that the conduct of firms in the market meet legislative standards.\nEBA: Conducts regular stress tests, to determine how banks would fare in potential crises.\nUK banks have recently been subjected to \u201cring-fencing\u201d, which forces banks to separate retail banking from riskier financial ventures. This is so that taxpayers don\u2019t end up paying in the event of a collapse.\nRing-fencing requires both sectors (retail and investment) to hold equal importance, which many banks are finding onerous. Sir David Walker, the former chairman of Barclays, insists that ring-fencing regulations are redundant and uniquely British, which will force banks to relocate. Banks will spend an initial \u00a3200 million to implement the reforms, and \u00a3120 million on extra staff requirements.\nThe ring-fencing reforms themselves will cost banks billions of pounds to maintain.\nBanks are regularly inspected by the FCA, and in the case of non-compliance, the FCA has the power to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban.\nThe regularity of inspections depends on how disastrous a firm\u2019s failure would be.\nP1 firms are firms whose failure would cause lasting damage to their clients and the marketplace. They are inspected once a year.\nP2 firms are firms whose failure would cause significant damage which is, however, relatively easy to deal with. They are inspected once every two years.\nP3 firms are firms whose failure would not cause much damage to clients or the market, and are only supervised on a reactive basis.\nUK banks are allowed to accept international clients. However, there are stipulations attached. Many banks do not take on non-residents, because of the strict regulations. If the client is in the UK for over 6 months, it is far easier to set up a UK bank account. The client will be required to have extensive documentation, as the banks are wary of international scams.",

    "text": "Brothers and Sisters, I would like to thank everyone that took time to attend a unit meeting this month. There is a lot going on with Oncor Electric Delivery. IBEW Local 69 is supporting the acquisition of Oncor Electric Delivery by Berkshire Hathaway. The parties will await the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision on how the deal will proceed. Also, Oncor announced a plan to swap assets with Sharyland Utilities in a transaction valued at approximately $400 million. The transaction is subject to approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas. When approved by regulators, Sharyland will receive approximately 258 miles of 345 kv transmission lines from Oncor, and Oncor will receive all of Sharyland\u2019s distribution network and retail delivery customers, totaling around 54,000 customers. I understand about 130 Sharyland employees will receive offers of employment to join the Oncor team. Let\u2019s hope they are not in management because, we have plenty of chiefs - we need more Linemen.\nThe happiest people in Texas are the Sharyland customers. The customers at Sharyland moving over to become Oncor customers will realize a significant rate relief, resulting in lower electric bills. Oncor and Sharyland will file a joint change-in-control filing with the PUCT. When approved, the transaction will be complete before the end of the year.\nThe Company is in the process of offering a contract extension to IBEW Local 69 members. At this time we have not received an offer in writing. At the unit meetings we discussed whether a one year contract extension or a two year extension would be in our best interest. We have one more week of unit meetings at the time this article is written, stay tuned for updates.\nLocal 69 and WFAA-TV will enter into negotiations on August 1st for wages only. After we have a solid offer from the station we will inform the membership and schedule a ratification vote at the station. You all know how hot it is. Don\u2019t get too hot and drink plenty of water.\nThere will be a Steward Training Class on Saturday, August 19, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. at Local 20\u2019s Hall. Local 20 is located at: 684 W Tarrant Rd., Grand Prairie, Texas, 75050. IBEW representatives will conduct the Steward Training. If interested please send an email to our local at ibewloc69@aol.com. There will be members from Locals 20, 66, 69 and 220 attending the training.\nPosted on August 7, 2017 by Teresa Reed.",

Alternately, when you type \u201cc\u201d while on the JIRA page, the following \u2018Create Issue\u2019 dialog opens up.\nAll the fields in this page are self explanatory. We will discuss the most important one below.\nProject: Every issue belongs to a project. You can choose the same by clicking on the drop down and choosing the project that you want this issue to belong to.\nThe items Bug, new feature, task, improvement are exactly what their names imply. Epic and story are more relevant to agile projects. Story is a requirement in Agile that needs to be tracked from start to finish. Epic is a group of stories.\nChoose the issue type as needed. I am going to go with \u201cBug\u201d.\nA bug/defect is essentially something that is not right. The right way to approach a bug title is to concisely define \u2018what\u2019s wrong\u2019.\nIt is also agreed, that when I open this bug and look into it in detail, I am sure I will find the answer to this question.\nIn the limited space that this field provides try to write your title in a way that communicates the exact issue without any ambiguity.\nPriority: This field can take one of the following values.\nChoose an appropriate option for your bug.\nComponent: This list will display the components of the Project. Choose appropriately.\nAffected Version and Fix version: These two fields will display the versions available for the project. It is not necessary that a certain issue that you encountered in a certain version gets fixed in the same one. In cases like that, you can choose the affected version as the current version and fix version as the next one.\nAssignee: You can type the name of the person to whom this issue should be handed over further. You can also assign an issue to yourself.\nQ5. Is it possible to access JIRA cloud site via a mobile device?\nYes, it is possible to access JIRA cloud site via a mobile device. You have to just use the URL of the JIRA cloud site in your mobile web browser.\nQ6. Explain labeling and linking issue in JIRA?\nLabeling Issue: It enables you to categorize an issue in a more informal way than assigning it to a component or version. You can then search issues according to label.\nLinking Issue: This feature enables you to link an association between two issues on either on the same or different JIRA servers.\nQ7. Mention the types of reports generated in JIRA?\nWorkload Pie Chart Report, etc.\nQ8. Explain what is Cloning an Issue?\nQ9. Mention what things are not included in cloned issue in JIRA?\nQ10. How to Use JIRA Effectively for Managing Agile Projects?\nAgile Methodology for software development has gained immense popularity in the recent years.\nAgile Projects follow an incremental approach to development of the requirements.\nOnce ranked, the stories are assigned developmental cycles (Sprints) that last for approx. 4-6 weeks.\nThe detailed documentation is avoided. Instead, a scrum board is maintained that will show the status and progress.\nJIRA successfully supports all the activities listed above for projects following an Agile Methodology. In this article, we will see how.\nNote \u2013 Firstly, you will need JIRA Agile add-on if you have not gotten it already.\nYou can have a product backlog by creating a main User story and having various sub-tasks under it.\nOr you can create an Issue type -Epic and Issue type \u2013 Story linked to it. To do so, in the \u2018Create Issue\u2019 page you can go to \u201cConfigure Fields\u201d and choose \u201cEpic link\u201d field to be included in the issue creation screen. \u2013 This is the most commonly used method.\nNote: You will not be able to link Epic to another Epic.\nFeature #2) There are two kinds of boards in JIRA agile. What are they and what they do is explained in the below window. Choose the appropriate board and continue through the steps to create a board. You will have to choose the projects from which issues are to be considered. In this article we are going to discuss a Scrum board.\nFeature #3) After a board is created you will be able to configure it as you see fit. Basically, there are two modes to a board \u2013 Plan and work. As the name implies, plan is the part where you can categorize your requirements (stories) into Sprints. Work mode is when you can track the time spent and the overall progress. Apart from these two you can generate several reports.\nThe plan mode displays all the user stories created for the project.\nYou can use the LHS menu to decide the basis on which the issues need to be displayed. You can choose to view all the issues or only the ones related to a certain Epic.\nChange the order in which issues need to be considered simply by dragging them up or down in the backlog.\nFrom the RHS side menu upon clicking on an issue, you can create links, sub tasks, log work and perform any other activity like you would on a normal issue.\nYou can use this screen to create a sprint too, if you have the right permissions.\nThis will display the Active sprint information. All the user stories are going to be categorized into To do, In progress and Done to show the progress clearly.\nGo to Agile Board->Reports. As you can see, there are lots of custom Agile reports that can be generated using JIRA. All you have to do is, choose the report that you would like and decide the data based on which this report should be generated.\nWith the right permissions or if you are an admin, you will be able to configure a board after its creation. To do so, go to \u201cAgile->Manage Boards\u201d. In the following screen, select the \u201cConfigure\u201d option next to the board that you want to edit from the list of the all boards available.\nThat completes the basic introduction into how JIRA can be used for Agile Projects. In my opinion, the tool when used right can provide solid support for this methodology. Since the focus on documentation is low in Agile, JIRA can be your one stop-shop to have everything in one place.\nNow, the obvious question: How is JIRA agile helpful for testers? Frankly, for the QA fraternity the scope of JIRA is either for bug tracking or task tracking \u2013 these do not change whether they are Agile Projects or regular ones. But having a good knowledge of this methodology by itself and the tool provided support is important because the IT world is shifting its focus to Agile \u2013 and we want to know all there is to know about it to make the best of it.\nQ10. Explain what is the use of \u201cMove Issue\u201d wizard in JIRA?\nCustom Fields: If you have determined required custom fields for your issue, which do not occur in the target project, you must set values for them.\nQ11. How security setting is helpful in JIRA?\nQ12. Explain how you can share an issue with other users?\nYou can email an issue by using the share option in JIRA. You can also email other JIRA users a link to the issue by sharing the issue with them or by mentioning them in an issue\u2019s Description or Comment field.\nQ13. Explain how you can modify multiple bulk issues?\nQ14. Explain how you can disable mail notification for Bulk Operations?\nTo disable mail notification for a particular Bulk Operations, you have to de-select the \u201cSend Notification\u201d checkbox in the bulk operation wizard.\nQ15. What does an issue change history include?\nQ16. Explain what does the three color indicates tracking times or duration for an issue?\nQ17. When you log a defect using TestDirector or JIRA what fields do you see?\nThe issue once created can be accessed by searching the ID, browsing the \u201cIssues\u201d menu item or going to the project details and checking the issues tab.\nWe will go in a sequential order from Right to left and discuss all the options.\n1) Edit: As the name suggests, this option lets you modify an issue created. Click on it and modify the information as desired. Choose \u2018Update\u2019 when done. This is similar to \u201cCreate Issue\u201d dialog.\n3) Assign: This is the option you would need when you want to shift the ownership of an issue. Enter the Assignee information, comments (anything that you would want to communicate) and choose the viewership of the comment. Once an issue is assigned to the user, an automatic email is sent (if this option is chosen by the admin) and the issue appears on the assignee\u2019s dashboard on login.\nAgile Board, Rank to Top, Rank to Bottom -> Related to Agile Projects \u2013 the details of which are going to be coming up in a later article.\nAttach Files, Attach Screenshots -> Lets you attach files to an issue. The screenshot option will auto capture a screenshot. All you need to do is print screen on your machine and you can directly copy it here into JIRA.\nAdd Vote, Voters, Stop watching, Watchers -> Voting is a process that JIRA users can perform to support the resolution of an issue favorably or unfavorably. The options in this section facilitate the same. You can also choose to watch an issue \u2013 when you do so, all the changes to it will be notified to you.\nCreate Sub-Task, Convert to Sub-task -> These are the options that help create and work with sub-tasks.\nLabels -> This concept is similar to the \u201cLabels\u201d that we find on various blog and web pages. You can categorize issues based on Version and Component formally, but when in need of something more informal, this option can be used. For example, all the issues raised to track peer review comments can be labeled \u201cpeer review\u201d to view and track them easily.\n5) Log work: This is a way to track the progress on your issue in terms of time. When this option is used, the following dialog opens up. As you can see, the detailed information about how much time is spent on an issue, how much is remaining, etc can be logged here.\n6) Move: JIRA issues can be moved across projects. However, the move from one project to another might mean a different target workflow, a different issue type, a new status etc. It is therefore advisable to analyze thoroughly how the move is going to affect the issue before going ahead with this.\n7) Link: This is a very versatile feature of JIRA that allows you can logically link issues with one another and establish relationships/dependencies.\nAn example situation where this can be used in QA projects is when a certain defect prevents you from working a certain requirement. You can use this option to show the dependency.\nConfigure an already created Project.\n3) Choose any of the above 3 methods to add a project. In the below window, choose the type of the project.\nTip: The Project type will determine the type of workflow your issues will go through.\nNote: Please note the \u201cImport from external systems\u201d link at the bottom of the page. If you have been using a different bug/issue tracking system and would like to migrate to JIRA. This is the option you could use. Also, if all you had earlier is an excel sheet for all your issues, you can create a project by importing all the issues in the CSV file into JIRA.\n4) Enter the project Name, Key (once chosen cannot be changed) and assign a Project Lead (the person who is responsible for the overall project). Click Submit when done.\n, versions and components, people involved and the level of access permissions they have etc.\nWe will see the creations, deleting and editing of an issue in details below. For the rest of the operations, we would encourage you to try them on the site with your trial ID.\nNote: With the trial you can add up to 10 users to your account i.e., 9 additional users and 1 admin, yourself.\nThere are two ways in which you can add users to JIRA.\n2) Enter the user details in the \u201cCreate new user\u201d dialog that opens up. In the below example I have entered only mandatory fields. The others are self-explanatory and can be set as required.",

    "text": "In the times we live in, it\u2019s a fact that a lot of people download music and movies from the web through P2P or BitTorrent. The music and movie industries naturally see this as a threat and try to stifle it, but it seems these attempts are in vain.\nThe idea is that companies, artists, actors and others should get paid for what they do, which is a fair assumption. The problem, though, is that the industry is stuck in old distributional chains where they had a lot more control. With the advent of Internet, however, things are bound to run out of control. My belief is that no matter how hard they try to legislate and to hunt people who fileshare down, the phenomenon will continue to exist, and also grow stronger in its rebelliousness against the \u201chigher power\u201d.\nThe basic, let\u2019s be outright honest about this, crap is that companies lose so-and-so much money on people who have seen, for instance, a movie by downloading it instead of going to the cinema. Just because someone has watched a movie illegally doesn\u2019t mean that they otherwise would have paid to see it. Most people watch movies in a casual manner, and instead of having some kind of fake hopes that this would have been money in the bank for the company, just see the enormous marketing benefit of this!\nIf they like the movie, they will tell their friends and recommend it. Their friends, in turn, might watch it in the cinema or buy the DVD; they might also just download it. Either way, if they like it, they will spread the word, and so on. Never underestimate viral marketing!\nIs what I want available when I want it? If not, how can I get it?\nThat\u2019s the core mindset of the audience, so it\u2019s time to listen to them. People love using the Internet for accessing their favorite music and movies, but the services today aren\u2019t well-developed enough and/or are so ridiculously overpriced that, as an example, a movie download will cost the same as buying the DVD in a store, but without the packaging and actual DVD record. What makes you think people would pay the same money for less value? Really?\nDRM is a joke. Really. Whenever a legally bought product, in any way, becomes harder to use than something that can be downloaded \u201cfor free\u201d, why would people pay? Throw away all your demands for restrictions, because they simply won\u2019t work. Let people share a movie or a song as many times as they want, through whatever medium they want.\nForget about proprietary solutions that limit the user to a certain computer platform or digital music (e.g. MP3) player. If, for any reason, the distribution channel forces the end user to use a product from a certain provider, you\u2019ve lost. There will always be cracks, hacks and workarounds, so you have to live with it. Tough, but that\u2019s the reality; never think you can outsmart such a vast community of people who are very technically skilled. DRM of any kind is the road to failure.\nSome people will never pay, and that\u2019s the way it is. A witch hunt will never make a difference, since their main goal is to get something for free, not the actual experience of what they\u2019re getting. However, I sincerely believe that a majority people want to go the legal route and pay for what they watch/listen to. Anyone, who is, say, 25+ of age, have grown up in a world where you actually had to buy what you wanted, in terms of records and movies. Kids who are teenagers now, and the coming generations, learn to download things from the Internet before they learn to pay. And they are really the gist of the problem.\nIf such a habit becomes a de facto standard for accessing any entertainment material, we will have to face a downward spiral with less and less income for companies producing music and movies. And then, at the end of the day, less quality content will be produced and distribution companies will go for the quick profit. Everyone loses.\nWhenever a music record, or, more importantly, a movie is released/having its premiere, people want it. Immediately! The buzz is right then, and as with all hypes, you have to let it work for you instead of against. Instead of fighting vigorously to quench it, music and movie companies have to start providing what people want. My humble take is that, if not already, the situation is on its way overboard. Listen to opinions, and try to meet the mass market\u2019s need and desires, to able to outcompete illegal file sharing.\nIn the area of TV shows and movies, people don\u2019t want to wait for it to come to their country, or to wait another week for the next episode of their favorite series. We live in a on-demand world and if the audience wants to watch several episodes in a row, let them have it (given that it\u2019s already produced, of course).\nWhen a movie (or TV show) premiers, make it instantly available as a download to all the world.\nMake it available in a format so attractive that searching through P2P and/or BitTorrent sites for a good quality copy is a waste of time.\nReasonable pricing: maybe $0.50 for a song and $5 for a movie.\nAlternatively, offer free ad-sponsored solutions, which will be a good complement to buying.\nNo DRM or any other lock-ins. Seriously.\nGeneral availability. Everything that\u2019s accessible through any other channel has to be available through the Internet as well.\nSome TV companies in the US made their TV shows available, ad-sponsored, online the day after they were shown on TV, which is, in general, a great idea. The problem with this, though (except for the fact that they haven\u2019t been able to watch as the exact same time as the program), is, again, availability. Sure, US citizen could watch it, but what about the rest of the world? Sure, I understand the problematic situation that they can\u2019t make it available to all the world simultaneously, while also trying to sell it to international networks. But this is most likely something that has to be changed to be able to cater to the whole world at once.\nSo, the only good example I\u2019ve seen so far of thinking in the right terms is Joost. It is ad-supported but otherwise completely free for the end user, who can choose to watch whatever he/she wants no matter the time (I\u2019ve been beta-testing Joost for a while now, and will write a review about it in the future; stay tuned). However, Joost doesn\u2019t yet offer movies so there\u2019s a wide open field there to target.\nAnd I think this solution is one of the ways there are to go: offer good content as easily available as possible, with a different financing plan than current alternatives have.\nAnyone, who is, say, 25+ of age, have grown up in a world where you actually had to buy what you wanted, in terms of records and movies.\nI'm not sure if I agree on this. Of course, I'm not 25+ of age, but my father told me stories about taping CDs or radio shows on cassette, and while this is of course not comparable to today's quantity of illegally copying/reproducing media, it's basically the same thing and in that particular time frame just as illegal.\nYou should also mention libraries that offer books, CDs, tapes and DVDs.\nTaping things on cassette and videotape caused a huge uproar at the time, comparable to the uproar burnable CDs caused when they appeared, and mp3 and other formats now.\nThe solution was to add a royalty tax to the devices in the case of cassette and video recorders; the movie and recording industries weren't totally satisfied with the solution, but it struck a balance.\nCanada made a similar move with mass storage devices which all carry a tax paid to the industry under the assumption that everyone is at least part pirate. I don't entirely agree with the premise (everyone is guilty, tax them all) but it might be the only solution.\nFor a similar view, take a look at Baen Free Library.\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.baen.com/library/home.htm\">Any cure which relies on tighter regulation of the market \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009d especially the kind of extreme measures being advocated by some people \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is far worse than the disease. As a widespread phenomenon rather than a nuisance, piracy occurs when artificial restrictions in the market jack up prices beyond what people think are reasonable. The \"regulation-enforcement-more regulation\" strategy is a bottomless pit which continually recreates (on a larger scale) the problem it supposedly solves. And that commercial effect is often compounded by the more general damage done to social and political freedom.\nI am a Canadian but that doesn't really mean I know anything more about the tax on CD/DVD-R than anyone else here. However, the tax must be small because, on sale this week, you can get a stack of 100 Fujitsu DVD-R discs for $25. I can't imagine that the tax would really be enough to cover the lost royalties on the 100 movies you could record to these discs.\nSecondly, I agree with all of Robert's comments with the minor exception of his assessment of a downloading fee of $5/movie. Given that rental shops charge just slightly more than that (albeit for a short-term rental and with a significant delay in availability), I think that closer to $3/movie would be the price point that buyers would be attracted to downloading.\nI am a Canadian but that doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t really mean I know anything more about the tax on CD/DVD-R than anyone else here. However, the tax must be small because, on sale this week, you can get a stack of 100 Fujitsu DVD-R discs for $25. I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t imagine that the tax would really be enough to cover the lost royalties on the 100 movies you could record to these discs.\n$0.29 : audio cassette over 40min long.\n66% of the levy is paid to the SOCAN, CMRRA, and SODRAC, 19.9% to NRCC for 'performers', and 15.1% to NRCC for 'makers'.\nThe current levy schedule is pretty close to that.\n'memory card' applies to SD, MM, and MemoryStick cards. Other formats are covered in some legalese document elsewhere.\nThe costs are more or less covered since the *vast* majority of disc and memorycards sold are not used to store pirated movies/songs, they're used for more mundane purposes.\nWell, as I see it, seeding a TV series should be generally accepted. The reasoning behind this is that the companies producing them doesn't really lose any (larger sums of) money. This because of the TV series being public as they are broadcasted on TV already and that people gladly pay their TV license anyway. So basicly it's a choise of weither wait for it to broadcast on TV or being able to see it whenever it suits you. I'd choose the latter in most cases.\nI was just wondering.. if you could download movies for $5 or $3 and songs for cheap.. that still wouldn't stop the buyer from adding their movies to a P2P network.. perhaps even unaware they did.\nOf course there's always going to be piracy, but I do like the idea of better quality movies or what have you for a cheap price. Maybe they could even burn the name or id of the buyer within the movie itself, to deter people from sharing (if you get what I mean).\nYou're right though Robert, I would gladly pay if it wasn't so expensive. I even find .99 cents ridiculous for an MP3 file. .50 sounds so much better, or even cheaper. Just like Hockey in Canada, it took them forever to realize nobody was physically going to the games anymore because the prices were ridiculous. Sometimes it's better to lower your prices, to increase sales (simple philosophy).\nNow.. if the cell companies would wake up and realize $2.50 for a ringtone is out to lunch!\nThanks, Robert. I think the current mentality is costing the industry far more money than copying. They need to mass deliver and take advantage of economies of scale. They need to think beyond the United States. Living in Vancouver, Canada, I can't understand the current limitations (and I realize there are greater laws that might affect delivery \u2013 such as language rights, etc). With that said, the mentality is so wrong. If I want to, I should be able to buy now \u2013 don't turn me away. Both the industry and governments need to realize the importance of this. I own a TiVo, but they wouldn't ship it to Canada, so I had it sent to the US. Now, I want to take advantage of Amazon Unbox and download a tv show I missed (yes, even with TiVo \ud83d\ude00 ), but I'm not allowed, because I am not in the US (which if I was I could also do for free by simpy visiting the producers website). So, I can't do it for free, and I can't even pay them to do it????\nCan someone tell me where the US ranks in population growth for the target demographic? Can you also tell me how many people live outside the US that fit the target (both in age and disposable income)?\nI believe that cost is the first issue. High prices make it more tempting to download than to buy. Lower prices and make your profit on volume.\nTake a page from tele-marketers and offer something \"extra\" for those who buy. When you buy an exercise machine because of an info-mercial they always give you something extra as an incentive to buy, like a cookbook. Add something that you can't download in the packaging to make it worthwhile to buy.\nFinally, work on a campaign to change attitudes about stealing, and it is stealing no matter how it's rationalized. The golden rule; \"do unto others as you would have them do to you\", \"honesty is the best policy\", \"if you were the owner/song writer/band/movie producer\u2026 would you want this to happen to you?\". I'm sure you can think of more. If you don't want to sponsor the message in advertisements, sponsor the message in movie and TV scripts.\nMy experience is that I buy more cd's now that it's easier to download and listen to them first. Of course, I won't buy all. But I do buy the good ones. CD's I otherwise never would have bought. Heck, from artists I've never heard about before I stumbled upon them in some download.\nAbout DRM: I'm just not going to buy a (quite expensive anyway) DVD if I can't be certain it will play in my DVD player, car-dvd-player, notebook player or a player at my friend's house.\nOr if I can't make a backup copy. Don't know about the cities you live in, but were I live it's not a good idea to leave original CD/DVDs in your car (even hidden in the trunk).\nThanks for your comments. And well, yes, there was a huge uproar about video, cassettes etc at the time, but it worked out fine, and the business didn't go down in flames, They just had to adapt, and now it is time, and it's more importantly than ever!\nSweden also has a price added-on to cassettes, CDs, DVDs etc to try to cover up for pirated versions. But seriously, how fair and modern is that approach? How many people who download music and/or movies will burn it on a CD/DVD?\nMusic will be transferred right to the MP3 player and movies will be saved on a computer's hard drive, or a hard-drive media center at home.\nI disagree very much with comparing unauthorized copying to stealing. After all there is one very important difference \u2013 theft concerns physical objects.\nA copyright owner does not lose his work when it is copied. A copyright owner can still sell his work, if someone has copied it. In fact, the copyright owner may in some cases have suffered no loss at all even if his work is copied.\nThis is quite contrary to theft where the rightful owner does lose his property, is unable to sell it, and suffers a very tangible loss.\nThis does not mean that I condone unauthorized copying of music, movies or software. Quite the contrary. But please don't use the corporate Newspeak.\nI don't down load music I like to blog to much for that ,it would take me away from blogging . I think people want more instant gradification and a lot of people well not get paid as much money in certain proffesions as they use to get paid . This is a transition period and new rules well be made . I really don't know how things well work out in the future but God takes care of the future God always takes care of the future .\nI am a downloader and have been since newsgroups were the start of everything. I believe I should have the right to test products whether that be music, software, movies or what have you. If I like it I buy it. Why would I want to buy something like software knowing that in two months there will be another version bigger and better. Maybe renting software would be the answer who knows. I believe in FTA as well even though I still pay for regular sattelite on top of it. We get priced to death on everything and we are sick of it. Cheers to the downloaders as I will always get what I can for free and only pay for the stuff that's worth it.\nI know, being in Australia, that a lot of people download stuff illegally because we have to wait MONTHS after things are released in the US to get it. Personally, I don\u2019t download them, simply because I do not know how. For example, Gossip Girl is not on TV here, and we only just had season 4 released. And with Psych, we only have season 3 released on DVD, and they are airing season 6 in America! Fair enough if we have to wait maybe a week or so, but seriously, so many people would stop doing it if we got it faster.",

    "text": "The Samsung SCB-9050 High Performance Thermal Night Vision Camera with 0.08\u00b0C temperature resolving power measures the surface temperatures of the field-of-view and displays the resultant data through temperature distribution images (thermal images). Equipped with IR imaging technology, the night vision camera works under 0 lux illumination and allows you to detect objects, people, and incidents even in complete darkness. The thermal camera has a detection range up to 360m.\nWith an uncooled microbolometer image sensor, the thermal camera displays bright and intense color images, created digitally to help distinguish details in the scene. Offering 8-14 \u00b5m long wavelength sensitivity, the IR camera delivers 320 x 240 pixel resolution thermal images with minimum impact from sunlight as well as during outdoor daytime monitoring in clear weather. The camera features a 14mm fixed focal length lens with maximum aperture of f/1.4, and offers 2x to 4x digital zoom.",

    "text": "Why do I have to study math and how does this relate to a pursuit of truth?\nYou know, growing up I would always ask the dreaded question that every math teacher would cringe and even made them question their vocation. I remember getting frustrated with certain mathematical problems and I would always ask, \u201cWhy do I need to learn this anyways?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like I am going to use this in the real world!\u201d Ah, I remember it as though it was yesterday. In fact, I think it was yesterday!\nSeriously, my elementary (junior high and high school too) would just look at me and realize that it was easier to dismiss my question with a sigh and or argument from authority and respond, \u201cbecause I said so!\u201d Little did I know that these seemingly complex mathematical problems were pondered and solved by generations upon generations of people before me. As a matter of fact, I could say that a problem as simple as two plus two equals four had a legacy of thought behind it, no matter how simple it was. Here I was not realizing what I had on my hands: I was working on a conceptual problem that either blessed or plagued thinkers way before me. In fact, it has been classified so important that every generation feels it is important enough to pass it down to the next generation.\nHere I am, in the 21st century and as an adult, I now realize that if I do not understand simple mathematical processes I will not understand concepts such as budgeting, percentage points, and interest rates on that credit card that I can never seem to pay. Without giving these math problems too much importance (I still hold resentment against them), I know that without them I would be \u201clost in translation,\u201d as it may, in many of areas of society. In fact, society cannot function without these \u201crules\u201d of math. If you think I am making a big deal about math, I think it really is a big deal. This \u201cbig deal\u201d could also be applied to other disciplines such logic, language, grammar, and even spelling.\nLet me bring the aforementioned illustration to the topic of Bible study and Christian thought. When engaging in the proper study of God and his word, every Christian should be asking the following questions. Well, before we go there and since we do not want to put Christianity on the hot seat as to whether all of us practice a good thought life, I am going to use my fictional character named Joe to take this role. To make it even easier, I am going to give Joe the script of questions he should be asking as a thoughtful Christian. Ok Joe, fire away.\n1. Why do I need to read and get to know my Bible?\n2. Why do I need to know if the resurrection happened or not?\n4. Why do I need to know what truth is?\n5. Why do I need to study theology?\n6. Why do I need to study apologetics?\n7. Why do I need to study epistemology? Episte-what?\n8. Logic! Are you kidding me?! I am not Spock and my spouse knows I am not logical sometimes.\n9. Metaphysics \u2013 ok, this is getting weird and somewhat uncomfortable, what is metaphysics?\n10. Can we just do devotions at this point; I am mentally exhausted.\nOk, Joe, we will let you off the hook. You did a good job and you hung in there for the series of questions.",

    "text": "(WASHINGTON) \u2013 International Brotherhood of Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa and General Secretary-Treasurer Ken Hall today announced that strike benefit increases approved by delegates to the 29th International Convention became effective on July 1, 2016. Under the new constitutional provisions, which were unanimously approved by delegates on June 30, 2016, the changes raise strike benefits, increase minimum benefits and allow for benefits to begin earlier than in the past.\nTeamster members will receive benefits that are based on five times their hourly dues rate, a 25 percent increase from four times the dues rate. The minimum out of work benefits will rise to $150 per week, an increase from $100. And, benefits will be paid at the end of the 8th day, previously paid at the end of the 11th day.\nThe improvements, with the exception of the hourly increase, also apply to newly organized members who have voted for the Teamsters and designated the Union as their bargaining agent, but do not yet have a contract.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.4 million hardworking men and women throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

    "text": "Volkswagen joined the sport utility vehicle market a little late, waiting until the 2004 model year to jump in with the Touareg, named after a nomadic desert tribe in the Saharas.\nThough the vehicle never threatened to knock the Ford Explorer and other more mainstream products off the top of the sales perch, it was and remains a solid, well-conceived SUV that genuinely takes its designation seriously. There's sport, and there's utility, in equal measure.\nAs a five-passenger vehicle, a lot of customers who need a third-row seat pass the Touareg by, but for the rest of us, there's an adequate 31 cubic feet of cargo space, which turns into 71 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down. Inside, the Touareg is roomy up front, reasonably spacious for two rear-seat passengers. Instruments and controls are among best in class, and the upholstery and trim has a genuinely premium look and feel.\nIt should because the Touareg isn't, and has never been, cheap. Starting at more than $40,000, our test model topped $53,010, and it didn't have all the available options. One option it did have that raised the price about $3,500: The 3.0-liter, 225-horsepower turbocharged diesel engine.\nDiesels typically cost more to build and almost always get better mileage than gasoline-powered engines, but with the added cost plus the fact that diesel seems to average about 40 to 50 cents a gallon more than regular gasoline, a lot of Touareg customers might stick with the standard 3.6-liter, 280-horsepower gas engine.\nThat said, the diesel does get better mileage \u2014 the EPA rates it at 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, while the gasoline engine is rated at 14 mpg city, 19 mpg highway. We averaged nearly 23 mpg in the diesel Touareg, which seems pretty good for a vehicle that weighs 5,304 pounds.\nReally, though, the Touareg is startlingly light on its feet. Handling is typically German, which means precise and controlled, but the ride is smooth, even on uneven surfaces. Where the Touareg has always surprised is off-road. Though it's not a dedicated rock-crawler, the Touareg can take on all but the worst terrain. It has low-range gearing for extra power, and the torque supplied by the diesel engine make it pull like a freight train. It's limited by the tires, though, which are understandably more designed for a quiet highway ride than mud-bogging. The Touareg can also tow more than 7,700 pounds, a lot for a vehicle this size.\nWhile the base-model Touareg has a lot of standard equipment, our tester had a $2,600 luxury package, a $5,200 technology package and a $500 tow hitch that, with shipping, upped the price to $53,010. A lot of those features I could happily do without, especially with so much equipment standard, including a power sunroof, Sirius satellite radio and walnut interior trim. All the safety equipment you'd suspect is standard, too.\nVolkswagen is updating the Touareg for 2011, so it could be a good time to make a deal on a 2010 at a hungry VW dealer. A year-end discount could fix the only real problem I've ever had with the Touareg \u2014 the window sticker.\nNutshell: Plenty of sport, lots of utility.",

    "text": "With Easter a month away and grass an easy crop to grow, why not consider a hand-painted terra-cotta pot filled with a bed of real grass? Finished off with a cloth ribbon handle, it's the perfect place to rest Easter treats and eggs decorated with natural dyes.\nIf you decide to create a ribbon handle, you'll need to drill holes in to the terra-cotta. Wearing safety goggles, drill two holes, one on each side of the pot, about 1/2 inch from the edge of the rim. As you drill, use light pressure to prevent the pot from cracking. Dust away powder.\nCover the inside of the pot with two to three coats of a water-based polyurethane sealant. While it dries, apply two to three coats of acrylic or latex base paint to the outside of the pot and the 2-inch lip inside the pot.\nThere are a variety of painting techniques to use when designing your basket. Regardless of the technique used, apply a few coats of a water-based polyurethane sealant over your finished design and allow to dry overnight before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace shard or gravel at the bottom of the pot and over the hole to allow for water drainage. Fill soil just up to 2 inches below top and work in a small amount of fertilizer. Sprinkle seeds onto soil, rake seeds with fork, and water with a spray bottle. Use this watering method until seeds sprout and roots are established. Place in a window and water every couple of days, keeping the top of the soil moist at all times. Once the roots have been established, adjust the watering schedule to once or twice a week. Growing time for grass is around four to five weeks.\nThe sun will fade the ribbon and possibly your painted design, so attach the ribbon after the grass has grown and protect the design by wrapping it with cloth. To attach ribbon, cut along the edge forming a needle. Insert ribbon into the first hole; bring enough through to tie a large knot at the end.\nRepeat the process on the other side of the pot. Adjust ribbon as needed. On larger, heavier pots ribbon is only ornamental. If unsure about using the ribbon as a handle, carry the basket from the bottom.\nTo ensure your sweet treats stay that way, don't water the basket the day before you'll use it because the grass and soil will retain moisture. For added protection, wrap candy and food in cellophane bags.\nSeveral fruits, vegetables and spices can create natural dyes. There are two methods for dyeing eggs: boiling raw eggs with dye agent (hot) or dipping hard-boiled eggs in cold or room-temperature dye (cold). Each approach will yield different results.\nHot boiling method: To create dye, use 2 tablespoons of white vinegar per quart of water, add dye ingredients and bring to a boil. To remove ingredients, strain solution into bowl and return solution to pan. Place eggs in pot; add additional water to cover. Bring dye solution and raw eggs back to a full boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Leave in pot longer for darker colors. Use spoon to remove eggs from solution, rinse with lukewarm water and allow to dry. Alternatively, you can boil the ingredients and the raw eggs simultaneously. Hot-dyed eggs are purely decorative and should not be eaten.\nCold dipping method: Boil eggs and dye ingredients separately. Cool and strain dye into small bowls. Dip eggs for five, 10, 30 minutes or overnight. As with the hot method, the longer the eggs sit in the solution the more intense the colors. Remove eggs from solution with spoon and allow to dry.\nEggs that last: Hollow eggs allow you to keep them from one year to the next. To create hollow eggs, thoroughly clean them with hot soapy water. Carefully hold egg in hand or steady in an eggcup and use small paring knife or thumb tack to make two small holes on both ends of egg. Remove egg white and yolk by blowing egg over the kitchen sink. Rinse eggshell under hot water and soak in hot water for 15 minutes. Allow water to drain, before placing in dye solution. Be sure the egg fills with liquid so it is submerged during the dyeing.process. The natural dyes will fade overtime; keep the color by applying gloss acrylic spray varnish.\nBlue painters tape and removable stickers are perfect for creating smooth lines, as well as striped or polka dot patterns. Apply first coat of paint and allow to dry; next, place tape around pot and apply second coat of paint. Allow last coat of paint to dry and remove tape to reveal the previous layer of paint.\nCreate designs with rubber cement, it protects the area where you wish to keep specific colors. Apply cement to the area and allow to dry. Paint pot with next color. Allow second coat of paint to dry before removing the rubber cement. Do so by gently rubbing it with your fingers.\nDecorate with decoupage. Use decoupage glue to attach and seal cut outs and stickers to your pot. Or, use rubber stamps and stencils to embellish your pot.\nRed: Boil 4 cups chopped beets or for light pink boil a can of beets.\nBlue: Boil 1/2 head of chopped red cabbage to 2 quarts of water.\nLight violet: Boil 1 cup of blackberries.\nGreen: Boil 1 cup of fresh spearmint leaves. Or, boil 2 cups fresh rosemary leaves.\nYellow: Boil 2 tablespoons ground turmeric.\nOrange: Boil 3 cups of yellow onion skins.\nBrown to dark brown: Use 1 quart coffee, omit additional water.",
