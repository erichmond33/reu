Last updated by Raam Dev 4 years, 11 months ago.\nI need a solution for a site I\u2019m developing with S2 Members Pro, the issue is the clients run a chain of shops across the UK and a magazine that is subscribed from all over the world. The client wants its clients to be able to not only sign up online but also in store, the problem is my client will not accept the 0.01p charge on the checkout with a 100% discount code, this is because they feel there customers will not like having to pay online.\nI know you suggest 2 options on the plugin: 1 being a free registration form but this is open to abuse if the link gets leaked and will also require a lot of moderation on the admin side of things to make sure each sign up actually did join in store. 2 being a free trial, we can set the trial up to last a year but then the checkout will still require a form of payment to start running once the trial period has ended.\nIs there any solution to this problem? we need it to be as secure as it can without being open to abuse and easy to administrate.\nWhat is the best solution for this?\nLet us know if that answers your question.",

    "text": "Everyone seems to want a brighter smile, and teeth whitening is a great option for boosting your confidence. If food and drinks have stained your pearly whites, you may be tempted to rush to the drug store and pick up the first over-the-counter whitening product you find. However, while side effects from whitening products are rare, you should follow these tips before bleaching your teeth to ensure your safety.\nIf your teeth appear stained, don\u2019t assume you need to bleach them. It\u2019s possible a good teeth cleaning will restore the sparkle to your smile. During an oral exam, your dentist will also check for cavities and gum issues, which should be treated before bleaching your teeth.\nAt-home whiteners most often use carbamide peroxide in concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent. Carbamide peroxide is hydrogen peroxide with urea added. This product remains active for up to 10 hours at a low enough acidity level that enamel etching is not a concern.\nStart with a product containing 10 percent carbamide peroxide. If the whitener doesn\u2019t bother your mouth, but you don\u2019t see the results you want, try another over-the-counter product with a higher concentration.\nWhen you choose an at-home teeth bleaching kit, it\u2019s your responsibility to follow the instructions on the package. Don\u2019t leave the gel or strips on your teeth longer than advised or you could experience tooth sensitivity and sore gums. Also, avoid drinking soda, sports drinks or other sugary/acidic beverages for several hours after whitening to prevent etching your teeth.\nAt-home whitening kits are inexpensive and widely available, but that doesn\u2019t make them the best choice. Professional in-office teeth bleaching can lighten your smile up to eight shades in a single 45-minute visit. Combined with professional-grade take-home treatments, patients see an average improvement of 11 shades. In comparison, over-the-counter whitening requires daily 30-minute applications for more than two weeks to achieve a six-shade improvement.\nIn-office whitening uses LED light-activated technology to maximize results in the shortest amount of time without causing tooth sensitivity. It\u2019s effective both for people who simply want to lighten their smile and for patients with severely discolored teeth.\nPregnant women and nursing mothers should postpone teeth bleaching.\nTranslucent teeth don\u2019t respond well to whitening. A tooth-colored composite placed on the lingual side of a see-through tooth is a more effective way to improve its appearance.\nZen Dental Center in Seattle offers Philips Zoom in-office teeth bleaching for safe, professional results.

    "text": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon.",

    "text": "Mahatma Gandhi1 once said, \u201cThe world provides enough for every man\u2019s need but not for every man\u2019s greed.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s easy to agree with proclamations of world peace and say things like, \u201cThe rich should really give to the poor and solve world hunger!\u201d However, when the giving strikes closer to home, it can be tougher than we think.\nI once had a watch that I thought was seriously cool. It was a boy\u2019s watch, but I didn\u2019t mind; it had all the dials and gadgets you could want. I visited my family and my younger brother was crazy about my watch and asked if he could have it. I told him I couldn\u2019t possibly part with such amazingness and sadly left it at that. Shortly after getting home, my treasured watch met with an accident and broke. It was then that I realized how stupid it was that I\u2019d missed the opportunity to give it to my little brother, who was so much more important to me than that watch ever could be. It might not have lasted him forever either, but at least he would have been happy for a while. And more than the watch, the meaning behind my giving him something special would have stuck with him so much longer.\nI try to remember that incident whenever I\u2019m tempted to be selfish with my things or start to prize them too highly. It\u2019s great to have nice things and groovy gadgets. (Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m fairly addicted to my phone, which contains all my appointments, mail, reminders, to-do lists, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, Google, and favorite games.) These days, the \u201cmust-have\u201d gadgets are endless\u2014from smartphones, iPads, laptops, and gaming equipment right down to 3D home TVs! If you\u2019re able to have some of these nice things and enjoy them and they help you with your work and studies, or are also a fun source of entertainment, technology can be great. But it\u2019s good to step back sometimes and imagine what it would be like if one day all those things instantly disappeared. After your initial withdrawal symptoms, you\u2019d realize that life goes on without material things. What matters most are our loved ones\u2014our friends and family members. Sometimes we can forget this truth, and that\u2019s when we tend to act selfishly.\nThe act of giving not only helps those we give to, but us as well. Luke 6:38 says, \u201cGive, and it will be given to you.\u201d2 Sometimes what you get back will be something tangible, such as the Lord supplying things you need or someone giving to you, but more often than not what you receive in return is the satisfaction that you did something good. Have you ever given someone something they really needed or wanted and watched their face light up? It\u2019s an amazing feeling!\nAn old American movie from the 1930s called The Man Who Played God is about a concert pianist who lost his hearing in a bomb explosion. He finally got through his depression when he learned how to read lips. He\u2019d watch people in Central Park (New York City), where they\u2019d talk about their problems and troubles, and he would do what he could to solve their problems anonymously. I think it would be amazing to do something like that, to know what other people need and be able to secretly give it to them.\nThere is a cute kids\u2019 song that one or two of you may have heard when you were knee high to a grasshopper, called, \u201cI\u2019d Like to Be Invisible.\u201d The singer wishes he was invisible so that he could \u201cspread love everywhere, and help in secret ways without you knowing he was there.\u201d (Yup, it even rhymed!) The truest part of the song, though, is where it concludes that you don\u2019t have to be invisible, because you can do things to make a difference all around you. You can make it a point to look for where the need is and do what you can to fill it.\nIt\u2019s a funny story but it rings true. It\u2019s easy for me to think that if I had a million dollars, I\u2019d love to give it away to help people, or to ponder all the great things I\u2019d do for my family with money like that; but when it comes to giving away a small portion of my free time to parents who could use a break from their kids, or doing a favor that costs me in the here and now, that\u2019s where the true essence of giving really kicks in.\nI know a lot of missionaries who do great works of evangelism and charity, and it\u2019s inspiring to read about the orphanages they help and the seminars they host, and all the other great projects they do. However, I have a very personal description of what makes a missionary: it\u2019s someone with a giving heart. That means not only do they do big, impressive (and usually well-advertised) works to help the poor or disadvantaged, but they\u2019re also always there to lend a helping hand whenever there is a need. They give to their own hurt; and they don\u2019t ask for or expect favors in return. They don\u2019t have a personal agenda. They just give. And you can feel their love and kindness in their actions. They\u2019re the ones you only ask for help when you really need it, because you know they\u2019ll do everything in their power to help you. In return, you want to do anything you can to help them. Their lives are examples of cheerful and selfless giving.\nI would love to be remembered as someone like that! Sure, we all have bouts of selfishness, and human nature tends to take the path of least resistance, but it\u2019s something to strive for, don\u2019t you think? Sometimes giving can be as simple as a sincere compliment, a hug, or a word of appreciation. It can also be giving your favorite gizmo to your little brother or sister when it would mean the world to them.\n3 Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883\u2013April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese artist, poet, and writer.",

    "text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996.",

    "text": "The Eastern Playoff race has been decided. The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.",

    "text": "Far Left Van Jones Admits that Trump Can Win and Gives Major Warning to Democrats - Video - Stumpin' For Trump!\nCNN contributor and former Obama aide Van Jones put out a warning to his fellow Democrats on Friday: Donald Trump is probably going to win the White House.\nIn the Facebook video, Jones credited Trump\u2019s ability to understand and use social media and reality television as well as his appeal to black voters as reasons he will likely win the White House in November.\nJones likened Trump to Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama in the sense that they all excelled in a new medium that no other politician could easily master.\n\u201cJust like FDR changed the rules of the game because he mastered radio, he was able to take radio and just completely master that \u2014 then you had JFK and JFK was able to master television \u2014 new medium, new master, new president,\u201d Jones said.\nHe continued to detail how Trump has been able to use his celebrity to appeal to parts of the Democratic base, especially black voters.\n\u201cIf only 70 percent don\u2019t like Donald Trump, that means 30 percent are open to his argument, if he gets half of those, he\u2019s president,\u201d Jones said.\nA Public Policy Polling report released on Monday showed Jones might be correct in his opinion that Trump is winning over large segments of the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc. The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?",

    "text": "In fact, there are currently over a million international students studying in the United States. India and China are by far the two largest contributors, with 47% of all students for the 2015-2016 school year.\nThe visa application process can be confusing though, especially when English isn\u2019t your strong suit. We at TransparentCareer have laid out each type of visa used by international students, and the application process for each visa.\nF1 Visa\u2013 These are the most common type of visas, and are used for bachelor and graduate school degrees, as well as training programs in the English language. The first step is to check whether the university you\u2019re interested in is verified by the United States government \u2013 you can\u2019t get an F1 visa for non accredited universities. Take a look here to see if your school is verified. The first step is to apply to universities where you want to study. Upon acceptance, the university will provide you with a form I-20. Keep in mind \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer once you select a school. Make sure it\u2019s the right fit for you! You\u2019ll then have to go to the site of the US embassy closest to you, and pay a non refundable application fee. Find the embassy closest to you here.\nYou\u2019ll then have to prepare for an interview \u2013 the sooner you can set this up the better. The interviewer will require proof of intent to return to your country after you complete your education (such as family, home job offer) as well as a passport and the form I-20 provided by your school. The interview will also require proof of financial sufficiency to fund your education. If you need advice on how to finance your education, take a look at this guide. Depending on your school you may also have to provide test scores such as the SAT, GMAT, or GRE.\nJ1A Visa\u2013 J1A visas are for those looking to temporarily stay in the US for a work or culture exchange program, such as to be an au pair, international camp counselor, or for specific medical training. To be accepted, you have to be sponsored by a nonprofit or government organization. You can find a list of all approved organizations here. After applying and being approved by an organization, they\u2019ll provide you with a DS-2019 form to fill out. Then you have to apply for a J1A visa at your nearest US embassy. A Sevis I-901 fee must then be paid (sometimes by your sponsor), along with a Nonimmigrant Application Processing Fee of $160. You must then schedule an appointment with the embassy, giving plenty of time in case anything goes wrong. Bring along the DS-2019 form provided by your sponsor, as well as your passport, a 2\u00d72 photo, and any additional documentation that may be required depending on the nature of your program. You can find the types of documentation on the J1A government site.\nM1A Visa\u2013 This is visa for vocational training in the US. There must be a specific program/school when you apply for the visa, and you\u2019ll have certain requirements and forms you might have to fill out for the school before applying for a visa. You aren\u2019t allowed to work while studying in the US, so you must prove to the school that you have enough money to stay in the US while getting your training. If approved by the school, they\u2019ll give you a form I-20 to fill out, which you\u2019ll need next when you set up a meeting at your nearest US Embassy. You\u2019ll also have to pay an application fee, and bring your passport, a photo (with rules provided by your consulate), a DS-160 form, and a DS-157 form if you\u2019re a male between the ages of 16 and 45.\nH1B Visa- H1B work visas are for those that have completed a higher form of education and want to work in America \u2013 it\u2019s the most common way for foreign students to stay and work in the US after graduation. These visas have to be filed by your employer, so if you\u2019re hoping to stay in America after graduation you should start the job search as soon as possible. Approvals are done through a lottery system, and start to fill up quickly after the government\u2019s fiscal year starts \u2013 typically October 1. You may file up to 6 months in advance, so filing as close to April 1 as possible is ideal. There are a total of 85,000 visas issued this way each year, and the first 20,000 are reserved for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher levels of education. The remaining 65,000 are available to those with bachelor\u2019s degrees, along with those that didn\u2019t make it past the first round with a master\u2019s or higher level of education.\nA lot of controversy has stirred up around H1B visas recently after the election of Donald Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that he wants to get rid of people who got into the US unfairly. According to Forbes, the top 10 companies that sponsor H1B visas received 25,000 visas in 2014, which is nearly 30% of all issued H1B visas. Of these 10 firms, half were firms based in India, typically working with call centers. Trump and others supportive of a crackdown claim that firms are submitting multiple applications for one person in order to game the system. 236,000 applications were received last year for the 85,000 positions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there were 236,000 applicants. While we haven\u2019t seen what a Trump presidency will look like yet, stopping people from abusing the system may provide more opportunities for foreign students looking to work in the US after graduation.\nCheck out our industry career guides on Finance, Consulting, and Tech to help you decide which is the best fit for you.\nLooking to stay in the states after graduation?

    "text": "WBS: why is it important & why it is not important?\nCan somebody post their view or opinion based on practice, why is it that WBS is not important or why is it that WBS is important in managing project?\nI appreciate all ur input.\ncreating a wbs forces you to think about how you are going to dissect your project and organize your project into meaningful groups or packages of work.\nIt is a way to group your work so that people can understand the where's the what's and the how's you will approcah the work.\nfor example if you were looking for an activity in the 2rd floor of Building B and the activities were not group by building and floor it would be very hard to find.\nAlso by using a wbs you can collapse work and summarise work more easily.\nI love a good WBS!\nSee below link to one of our newsletters.\nI started using activity codes even before WBS functionality was available. And I still use them, precisely for purposes as you mentioned - eg filtering the plastering items etc. And since I started using these things from DOS days, I also make use of the characters in activity ID to represent various things. And as you correctly mentioned, it is also possible to get those functionalities from few characters in the activity description.\nIn fact, the best way to input your coded information is in the activity id. That way, the information is \"in built\" and cannot be changed easily.\nAll these things including searching and filtering (eg for filtering for certain characters in activity id or description) work well when everybody is disciplined in naming and coding. And as long as one person is doing all these things, everything works perfectly well for him (as it does for me and you). But when you are integrating programmes from various contractors, it is not easy to excecise those rules with planners from various firms.\nWBS concept is as old as project management but its functionality appeared relatively late. Even in P3 3.1, WBS is still optional function that appears the same way as acivity codes. And some people still don\u0092t use it because 1) it is optional 2) activity codes seem to do the same job and 3) they are more used to activity codes. But even in P3 3.0, WBS code can do things which activity codes can\u0092t.\nFor example, you can have WBS activity and it does not need any links as in hammock activities. And this WBS activity can summarise all the activities which have the same WBS code. When you need a high level programme that shows bars in the same line as activity description (activity code roll up bar appears one line below), you can just filter for WBS activities and you get very good presentation. And the list goes on.\nAnd when you start using P3e, WBS is no more optional and it appears more different than activity codes and thus makes it more apparent. But activity code has more functionality in new programmes as well as you can have second level of codes within same acitity code. And these lower levels of codes work exactly the same way as WBS does. So you can have work breakdown stucture as well as ANY breakdown structure using a single code.\nBut as long as you have to use two or more actity codes (as you have to do in P3 3.1 and earlier), to make your work breakdown structure, it is far more easier to do so using the in built WBS coding. (And you can of course, still use activity codes, for other functionalities).\nI can therefore sort as activity description contains plastering and all the activities drop out. Now If I have also coded for floors and towers I can organise so the towers and floors show up so I know where I am.\nThat means I need to code in a tower and a floor with each activity, thats pretty easy cos I can copy and past this info.\nIf I am really smart when I copy and past the fragnet I can add some alpha numerics at the end of the ID ie 100 activity number from fragnet then T1 (tower 1) then F1 ie the id is know 100T1F1 this helps in that I can sort all activities in tower 1 or floor 1 or whatever so by using the ID and the description almost without touching the codes we have a pretty robust sorting catergory. In turn when you can sort in this way logic application and resource balancing becomes much easier.\nLets go back to the plastering scenario we now have all the activities, so linking floor to floor or globally copying resources is easy as is levelling them because you can see whats happening and more importantly so can everybody else.\nIn this way you can tell your subby exactly what he needs.\nI am not saying you cant do it with WBS and of course you can what I am saying is for a great deal of what we do in building and Civil Engineering WBS codeing is excessively complicated.\nI\u0092m Currently using Hierarchical code structures to help with the application of the cost accounts from our cost tool. I simply apply the codes to the activities and then group and sort with totals and balance my activity budgets.\nSo you can use code fields to give rudimentry totals for Units.\nThis process has helped me immensley as when I started with this company 9 weeks ago there wern\u0092t even any baselines in the projects and they were using units % Complete and just adding extra hours to the remainings by multiples of 10 or 50. They even expected to be able to resource level with this data.\nActivity codes look good and seems to show what you want to show only when data is organized in a particular way (eg phase, location, contractor etc). So it is very much a Layout depedent method.\nWBS works no matter how you organize your activities. And you can have WBS activity (in P3 for example) which summarises all the activities which have the same WBS code no matter where those activites are located. There is no such functionality available for activity codes.\nFurthermore when you organize activities with acitity codes, you will always end up with groups with no names. Planner would understand it but there would be many would be questining it everytime they see it.\nSo when you want work breakdown that really add up to whole project, use WBS. It is that simple. And use activity codes for other organizing and filtering purpose.\nI suppose WBS & Codes are lying on the same concept, so why bother? you\u0092re not showing codes on your schedule anyway.\nDont let anybody walk away with the idea when you have explained something \"gee I wonder what he is smoking\"\nOften in fact more often than I care to remember I dont employ planners because they cant do their job but because they cant explain what their job is.\nRemember we are planners, that makes us somebody who assists the process not somebody who actually does it, so go and assist the person doing it by understanding what he wants not what you feel you should give him.\nThe WBS structure is simply an end to a means.\nThe end is being able to provide BAC, ACWP, ETC, EAC & EV for particular portions of the project.\nThe WBS is simply the most widley used method of doing this, and as a consequence comes as a standard part (or code) of most planning/scheduling software.\nAs far as codes go - well the world is your oyster.\nAs far as how to, and what size, and by what method you chose to quantify and divide your project up, it\u0092s really up to you..... However you should document what each structre is for and what assumptions were made to arrive at the particular structure.\nCBS - Cost Breakdown Structure, ETC.\nAgain I will say it\u0092s limitless to how many you can have, but you should document what it is and how you came up with it.\nThat way when you\u0092re asked to explain a code field that you thought was a good idea at the time - Your manager doesn\u0092t walk away with the \"I don\u0092t know what that guy was on about\" thought in their head.\nthis is very simple! you use WBS or Codes to make your Project become \"Measurable\" either in a summarized form or a detailed one. But how do you put a certain unit to a summarized deliverable? Isn\u0092t it Lump Sum (LS)? and how do you define Lump Sum? are you gonna need WBS or Codes?\nWhile the Explanation is well \"dry but clear\"\nI think all would benefit more if you provided sonme clarity with examples.\nAs I have mention before WBS development can be viewed as the process of grouping all project elements into several major categories, normally referred to as Level One; each one of these categories will itself contain several subcategories, normally referred to as Level Two. Alternately, and more accurately, developing a WBS involves dividing the deliverable items until the project has been divided into manageable, discrete, and identifiable items requiring simple tasks to complete that, when combined, constitute the project deliverable.\nLogically is to keep dividing the project until the elements cannot realistically be divided anymore and may vary from organization to organization or may even vary among project managers within the same organization.\nEach level of detail contains not only organization specific, but they also are specific to the nature of the deliverables involved in each project. Similarly, the degree of detail at the lowest level of each branch must be in line with the size of the project and in conformance with the organization\u2019s operational philosophies.\nIdeally, there should be some uniformity and consistency in the WBS. To achieve this uniformity, all children of the same parent must be developed based on the same division basis.\nUsual practice of WBS are using three division levels which are \u201cDeliverables oriented (Structure or products, functional system, physical area and proof of capability)\u201d, \u201cSchedule oriented (normally referring to a task or activity and sequential/ phases)\u201d and \u201cResource oriented (disciplines, administrative units and financial accounts)\u201d.\nSo again, no matters how you do it by codes or groups fields or using the WBS field as long as you define the structure into manageable level and represent the project deliverable that will contribute to success of the project.\nMost of my work is in building construction, so maybe the fact that I like codes better is biased by my work.\nBut if sometimes you need to see activities organized by floor; sometimes by trade; other time by trade within each floor, etc. There\u2019s no way to do that except with codes.\nDo other lines of work have the same need or is it enough for you to squeeze into a rigid WBS and limit reports and analisys to that single point of view?\nwhat I believe it says is that progranmmes should be structured in such a way as to enable sorting in a logical and affective manner thus enabling the team to ascertain an accurate picture of the progress of the works and the elements that make up the works.\n\"for hard planning thinkers\"?? they don\u0092t know how to use codes?\nWBS show the heirarchy of Scope of work and deliverables.\nWBS is the standard for PMI, PMP, Planning Professional.\nIt is very clear in PMI influence or way of project management in general and planning in particular way of managing project.\nSo for hard planning thinkers, WBS is the preference.\nI think the need and importance of structure in a schedule is clear and proven. The point now is how.\nI prefer primavera codes over WBS or outlines. Codes are much more flexible and let you organize activities in different ways to analize different aspects of a schedule. WBS an outlines are rigid.\nOf course you can use both at the same time, but unless I\u00b4m forced by a client, I don\u00b4t use a WBS, but codes.\nIt\u0092s just a simple divide and conquer technique. It a way to go from general to specifics. It\u0092s like writing a book first you have the outline the going to the details and contents.In a way it helps in organizing a project and simplify the job of a planner.\nBreakdown Structure - Work, Cost, Organization..whatever it is..It is important! I think nobody is using a one liner schedule!\nJust to explain more on WBS. As I have said on the other thread (Work Breakdown Structure is a results-oriented family tree that captures all the work of a project in an organized way. It is often portrayed graphically as a hierarchical tree; however, it can also be a tabular list of \"element\" categories and tasks or the indented task list that appears in your Gantt chart schedule). Meaning it can be shown on a different approach or style as long as it became meaningful and useful to other member of project management. It defines as a level of schedule to make it more sensible and manageable. It is used to define the project objectives with sufficient detail information into more detail groups of scope or task. Some planner/ scheduler used activity codes as their WBS and others are just the first 1, 2, 3 or 4 character of their activities.\nProper schedules are using this technique according to their own methods so they can level their schedule to more manageable levels.\nOn my own view \u201cschedule without the proper work breakdown structure is going nowhere or meaningless as its does not show the sensible picture of the project\u201d.\nAny serious program must have some kind of organization so it is usable for control.\nWBS is one way, but there\u0092s also activity codes.\nThe more detail that you want to see (monitor), the more important the WBS. A formal and logical structure helps capture the project data (activity type, resourcing, costing, progress etc.) in the most appropriate \"pigeon-hole\".",

    "text": "\u201d It may seem surreal, but as work continues to decommission damaged reactors at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant\u2013a project that involves 7,000 or so workers\u2013tours of the complex by outsiders are becoming increasingly popular.\nBy the end of last September, or four-and-a-half years since the nuclear accident triggered by the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami disaster, some 16,000 people had visited.\nInitially, visitors to the stricken facility were mainly politicians and specialists. But more recently, ordinary citizens are taking part as radiation levels have fallen at the plant site.\nNineteen university students took a tour last November. The bus they rode took them past large tanks holding contaminated water as well as a massive piece of equipment attached to a reactor building to extract nuclear fuel. Throughout the visit, workers wearing protective clothing and face masks could be seen.\nThe tour was organized by a group called AFW, which stands for Appreciate Fukushima Workers. Led by Akihiro Yoshikawa, 35, a former employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken plant, the group began escorting tours by residents living along the Pacific coast of Fukushima Prefecture from 2015. A major objective of the tours is to show residents what decommissioning involves.\n\u201cIf ordinary citizens abandon interest, the plant site will be further shut off from the rest of the world,\u201d Yoshikawa said.\nHe said that 140 or so people had participated in the seven tours organized to date.\nIwaki resident Kaori Suganami, 39, took part in a tour last June.\nBecause of the core meltdowns at the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors, high levels of radiation continue to be emitted. This makes it very difficult to approach those three reactors.\nElsewhere, though, rubble that was strewn throughout the plant grounds due to the tsunami generated by the magnitude-9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake has been removed, and radiation levels in many areas have dropped significantly. Ground surfaces have been paved and trees felled, which has also helped lower radiation levels.\nAccording to TEPCO, about 900 people visited in the first year after the nuclear accident. Since then, the annual number of visitors has continued to increase. Local residents joining the tours also grew in number. About 3,700 people visited the plant in the first half of fiscal 2015. Of that number, about 250 were from Fukushima Prefecture.\nUnlike workers at the plant site, visitors are not required to wear heavy protective gear. The basic getup is cotton gloves, disposable face masks and special footwear. Visitors are required to carry dosimeters. To reduce radiation exposure, visitors remain on the bus for large parts of the tour. Radiation exposure after an hour is in the range of 10 microsieverts, which is about 1 percent of the maximum additional radiation exposure of 1 millisievert established for the general population.\nIn April 2014, TEPCO established a visitation center at the Fukushima plant and two to three groups consisting of individuals 18 or older are allowed in daily. But not just anyone is allowed on the tours. \u201cAn overall assessment is made after considering such factors as the objective of the visit,\u201d said a TEPCO official.\nThe decommissioning work is expected to take decades.\n\u201d FUKUSHIMA\u2013Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s population has declined by 5.7 percent since 2010, its largest recorded drop and the cause of a widening gender gap in some areas, according to national census figures announced on Dec. 25.\nThe population drop is mainly due to ongoing evacuations following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to the preliminary figures released by the prefectural government.\nThe prefecture lost 39,715 men and 75,743 women, a decrease of 4 percent and 7.3 percent from 2010, respectively. The difference is thought to have been caused partly by the majority male presence in reconstruction efforts.\nThe national census figures are the first released by the prefectural government since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.\nFukushima prefecture\u2019s population as of Oct. 1 stood at 1,913,606, down 115,458, or 5.7 percent, from the last census in 2010.\nAmong the six towns and villages where the entire population has left under evacuation orders, four towns recorded zero inhabitants: Okuma and Futaba, which co-host the nuclear plant, and nearby Tomioka and Namie.\nThe village of Katsurao had 18 people who have returned to their homes after being evacuated. They are recorded as temporary residents, but the central government is working to make their resettlement permanent. Katsurao\u2019s evacuation order is scheduled to be lifted next spring.\nNaraha, where an evacuation order was lifted on Sept. 5, also experienced a massive decrease in its population, with 976 people living in the area, down 6,724 people, or 87.3 percent, from 2010. The figures illustrate the fact that few evacuees have opted to return home.\nThe town of Hirono, where a large portion of the population is involved in nuclear reactor decommissioning work, tallied a male population of 2,746, up 2.3 percent from 2010. The female population, on the other hand, was about half that figure at 1,577, down 42.3 percent.\nThe population figures are based on the number of people living in the prefecture as of Oct. 1, irrespective of whether they are registered as local citizens.\n\u201d Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant, has opened a rest area and canteen for cleanup workers, more than four years after the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\nTokyo Electric has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions at the plant.\n\u201cWe have taken various steps to cut accidents, including Tokyo Electric itself working more with contractors on the ground,\u201d Akira Ono, Fukushima plant manager, told Reuters.",

    "text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully.",

    "text": "during our conversation it became apparent Jerome has developed a great approach to the sport, being backed by a good team, coupled with a dynamic fighting style, he is definitely one to watch.\n\u201cI started boxing when I was 21, so I started late, I just went to the gym with a friend, I had always watched boxing but never took that much of an interest in it.\nAfter I went to the gym once I got a feel for it, everything about it, the environment, the smell of the gym and from there it has catapulted, it became an obsession, it went from a hobby to a lifestyle.\n\u201cI had 35 fights, I won the Haringey box cup, I reached the national finals in 2016, I won London titles twice, so yeah, in the last two years I\u2019ve seen my amateur career take off.\n\u201cYou know what it is, I am a strong believer in timing, and at the age of 26 I wasn\u2019t going to gain much more from the amateurs, as in it might take me away from what I want to do as a pro.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve got guys at the IQ Boxing Gym in Neasden, North West London, my main coach is Xavier Miller, and my promoter is Steve Goodwin. Me and Xavier get along like a house on fire, as much as I like him as a coach, I also do as a person. We have a good understanding and it\u2019s a great relationship.\n\u201cSo, like I said, as an amateur I was relying a lot on reflex, movement, counter punching, but not as a pro, I\u2019m going to focus on sitting my weight down, catching shots, returning shots and working the body.\nI would love to say I can adapt to any shape or style but I have to be realistic, I would say that I\u2019m a thinking fighter, I can work out people\u2019s fight quite quickly so I can entertain different styles.\n\u201cWithout trying to sound arrogant or cocky I feel like I\u2019ve got the makings to go all the way, I feel like I\u2019m destined for great things and it\u2019s a matter of time until everyone else starts to believe it.\nIn 2018 I\u2019m just looking to get the whole experience, and I think if I could get 4 fights this year I would be happy with that, I\u2019m looking to soak up the experience and fight in front of a big hyped up crowd. I\u2019m also sparring 6-8 rounds at the moment so 4 rounds shouldn\u2019t be too bad.\nJerome Campbell makes his debut tonight on Goodwin Boxing\u2019s \u2018Venom\u2019 show at the infamous York Hall. Featuring on a strong card, Jerome is bout #6 of the evening. 4 x 3 minute rounds in the lightweight division, sharing the ring with Luke Fash.",

    "text": "Each year, there are more than 100,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S. Many of these were caused by household substances that may seem perfectly harmless to you. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won\u2019t hurt beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis.\nDepending on how a particular substance affects your dog\u2019s body and how much was ingested or inhaled, pet poisoning symptoms can include gastrointestinal and neurological problems, cardiac and respiratory distress, coma, and even death.\nDog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the opposite effect in pets. And it doesn\u2019t always take a large dose to do major damage.\nPrescription anti-inflammatory and pain medications can cause stomach and intestinal ulcers or kidney failure.\nAntidepressants can cause vomiting and, in more serious instances, serotonin syndrome -- a dangerous condition that raises temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and may cause seizures.\nDog poison No. 2: Insecticides.\nFlea and tick products. You may think you\u2019re doing your dog a favor when you apply products marketed to fight fleas and ticks, but thousands of animals are unintentionally poisoned by these products every year. Problems can occur if dogs accidentally ingest these products or if small dogs receive excessive amounts. Talk to your vet about safe OTC products.\nDog poison No. 3: Over-the-counter medications. This group contains acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen and naproxen (Advil, Alleve), as well as herbal and nutraceutical products (fish oil, joint supplements).\nDog poison No. 4: Pet medications. Just as we can be sickened or killed by medications intended to help us, cases of pet poisoning by veterinary drugs are not uncommon. Some of the more commonly reported problem medications include painkillers and de-wormers.\nDog poison No. 5: Household products, from cleaners to fire logs. Just as cleaners like bleach can poison people, they are also a leading cause of pet poisoning, resulting in stomach and respiratory tract problems. Not surprisingly, chemicals contained in antifreeze, paint thinner, and chemicals for pools also can act as dog poison. The pet poisoning symptoms they may produce include stomach upset, depression, chemical burns, renal failure and death.\nDog poison No. 6: People food. Your canine companion may look so cute as he sits there begging for a bite of your chocolate cake or a chip covered in guacamole, but not giving him what he wants could save his life. Animals have different metabolisms than people. Some foods, such as onions and garlic, as well as beverages that are perfectly safe for people can be dangerous, and sometimes fatal, for dogs.\nChocolate . Though not harmful to people, chocolate products contain substances called methylxanthines that can cause vomiting in small doses, and death if ingested in larger quantities. Darker chocolate contains more of these dangerous substances than do white or milk chocolate. The amount of chocolate that could result in death depends on the type of chocolate and the size of the dog. For smaller breeds, just half an ounce of baking chocolate can be fatal, while a larger dog might survive eating 4 ounces to 8 ounces, though 8 ounces would be extremely dagerous. Coffee and caffeine have similarly dangerous chemicals.\nAlcohol. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning in animals are similar to those in people, and may include vomiting, breathing problems, coma and, in severe cases, death.\nAvocado. You might think of them as healthy, but avocados have a substance called persin that can act as a dog poison, causing vomiting and diarrhea or worse.\nMacadamia nuts. Dogs may suffer from a series of symptoms, including weakness, overheating, and vomiting, after consumption of macadamia nuts.\nGrapes and raisins. Experts aren\u2019t sure why, but these fruits can induce kidney failure in dogs. Even a small number may cause problems in some dogs.\nXylitol. This sweetener is found in many products, including sugar-free gum and candy. It causes a rapid drop in blood sugar, resulting in weakness and seizures. Liver failure also has been reported in some dogs.\nDog poison No. 7: Chocolate. See above.\nAzaleas and rhododendrons. These pretty flowering plants contain toxins that may cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and potentially even death.\nTulips and daffodils. The bulbs of these plants may cause serious stomach problems, difficulty breathing, and increased heart rate.\nSago palms. Eating just a few seeds may be enough to cause vomiting, seizures, and liver failure.\nDog poison No. 9: Rodenticides, if ingested by dogs, can cause severe problems. The symptoms depend on the nature of the poison, and signs may not start for several days after consumption. In some instances, the dog may have eaten the poisoned rodent, and not been directly exposed to the toxin.\nDog poison No. 10: Lawn and garden products. Products for your lawn and garden may be poisonous to pets that ingest them.\nIf you think your dog has been poisoned, try to stay calm. It is important to act quickly, but rationally.\nFirst, gather up any of the potential poison that remains -- this may be helpful to your veterinarian and any outside experts who assist with the case. If your dog has vomited, collect the sample in case your veterinarian needs to see it.\nThen, try to keep your pet calm and call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at (888) 426-4435. Experts at the APCC are available to answer questions and provide guidance 24 hours a day for a $60 consultation fee. Another option is the Pet Poison Hotline with a fee of $59 per incident.\nKeep all medications, even those in child-proof bottles, in cabinets that are inaccessible to your dog. If you inadvertently drop a pill on the floor, be sure to look for it immediately. Supervise anyone, such as the elderly, who may need help taking medications.\nAlways follow guidelines on flea or tick products.\nAlthough you can safely give some ''people foods'' to your pet as a treat, others are toxic. If you have any questions about what is safe, ask your veterinarian. Or, err on the safe side and give treats made specifically for animals.\nBe sure any rodenticides you use are kept in metal cabinets or high on shelves where your pets can't find them. Remember that dogs can be fatally poisoned by eating an exposed rodent, so always be very cautious about using these products. Tell your neighbors if you put out rat bait, so they can protect their pets from exposure, and ask them to do the same for you.\nWhen buying plants for your home, opt for those that won\u2019t cause problems if your dog happens to nibble on them. The ASPCA has an online list of toxic and nontoxic plants by species. If you choose to have toxic plants, be sure they are kept in a place where your animals can't reach them.\nStore all chemicals and cleaners in pet-inaccessible areas of your home.",

The points on 03 seem to be frozen; even though the indicator arrows switch from red to green, the points stay in the same position. Also, whenever I try to run a loco through either turnout, it derails! Close visual inspection does not reveal any immediately obvious reason for this to be happening, and I am moving at less than 10 mph with the points properly set, so I can't see that it's anything I'm doing, either. Help???\nPlS NEVER feel bad if something is not working(lucky happen very rare!) as we all know very well certain things(N3V bugs) we have no control but can repair luckily at least so i feel good when i can help.\nby tonight or tomorrow dec. 31st latest I will have a updated version of CPR Mountiain Sub and Rogers Pass both under release 1.0.2.\nIf you are interested to receive please email me on roystrainz together with information on your username so I can provide each one with a newer version.\nupdate contains replaced corrupted switches, repaired textures dissolved left and right and also a new speed and signal update.\nThe signal update will cover Viktor Lake till half way Lake Kinbasket to Donald Station.\nPlease report any missing, corrupt or not working item so we can update them in the next version end of january 2013.\nthanks for all the nice post and help to get this blog getting better and more lively.

I consider this not to bad and would accept the HUD not to be correct. The more once the train passed the signal it turned yellow for S 1095S so proofed the HUD is little bit off. Your take and please do not be shy to post something here.\nTrouble with the 1.0.2 download. I'm getting a file not found error. Possibly because the link says crp rather than cpr?\nHappy New Year to all of you!!!!!!!!\nI confirm that the download of version 1.0.2 and the installation in Trainz went as expected, ie. no problems at all.\nThanks for such good service and for such a superb route.\nThanks Gilles most other Roy's trainzers confirmed also good execution of the new release and yes works as expected, thanks for the ice comment.\nHi everyone! I want to thank Roy for an AMAZING route (I bought the 3-in-1 CPR Mountain Sub)!! The detail is ridiculous and I cannot even imagine the effort and time it took to create this route. Today I spent some time reading the new PDF instructions for the CMTM System (http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showt...7-CMTM-Upgrade) and was wondering if anyone else other than myself is crazy enough to attempt creating at least one session utilizing it. It seems like a daunting endeavor and I have no doubt that it would be an intense effort. However, I believe that a few of us dedicated enough may be able to team up and put something quite impressive together for this equally impressive route. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I especially would like Roy to chime in here too. Thanks!\nEnough industries to do the first steps with lumber industries rolling stock and truck bringing the lumber from the forest..eg.\n64WarHorse, yes, I think that there are enough industries, esp if you include the whole Mountain Sub. Not to even mention what Roy here has proposed (integrating it into his upcoming additional route(s)). CMTM does support all sorts of cool scenarios as mentioned by Roy, not just yard/switching duties specifically. I am in the process of learning the new CMTM version (v.4) and would gladly contribute as much time/effort that I can to developing some sessions if we do it in a team fashion. :) Maybe we can start small at first and make some very basic sessions/scenarios to see how it goes. If all works out well then we can collaborate and come up with some truly epic sessions for these awesome routes! This idea is very exciting for me and if some of you share my enthusiasm (esp Roy), I really think we could build something legendary here. Idk. Maybe we can pull DAP (CMTM creator) into this somehow too.\nOkay, colour me intrigued. So where do we start? I suppose the first question would be, do we need to modify any rolling stock for CMTM?\nThis is the most expensive ad-on I have ever bought, but I consider it worth every penny.\nKeep the spirit high. :) I really look forward to following the devlopment of Your project.\nSteve i agree i will tell Ray to change the background in a neutral easy to read color monday! promise!\nChrisD yeeeehhh wow that feels good you like it as so many did already before you and yes it is a marvel and yes worth every penny you spent There is so much to discover it will take you a lot of time to find out and still not see it all,........that means yes i spent a lot of time creating this and hope to finish the next section soon.\nRailworks user here that just had to see what Trainz was capable of in its most extreme! Picked up Trainz on 75% discount and bought the Rogers Pass route from your site. The level of detail in this route is amazing. Im a routebuilder in Railworks, and I know how long it takes to build anything. I cant imagine it being any different in Trainz.. Your work is really and I mean really fantastic! Its all in the details as they say and your route has it all. Take care all and thanks again for your hard work Roy!\nHello all! Sorry for the few days absence but I've been quite busy lately. Anyway, I am almost done reading and re-reading the CMTM documentation and would soon like to start collaborating with those of you interested in helping me out with some basic CMTM session ideas and subsequently creation. All of those interested should PM me on the main Trainz forums thread and send me their e-mail addresses so we can communicate more efficiently. Or, feel free to e-mail me directly at runthat1@gmail.com.\nsaw that one too1 I did straighten a track segment and did not realize the signposts were separate and so got this cosmetic error. Moved the post and fixed already, thanks for reporting.\nThank you for this nice route it is wel very long to drive cpr mountain sub -)) my wife is killing me.\nGuillaume, i cannot advice you what is a less of more painful death, killed by your wife or trainz excitement, lol.\nThanks 4 sharing, Ning laughs she understand.\nHopefully this will work in TS12, seeing errors as I install, previous versions errors, warnings. All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the routes!\nall related to JVC grass items by author jankvis.\nmissing deps or unknown deps 99% of the time are caused by to many cdp's installed at the same time in Content Manager Program! So if jankvis has unknown ora ny other look for the author and reinstall that group like here for Jankvis go to group 3 dependencies you downloaded and reinstall the group J in there, should work flawless honest.\nhmm working in my dungeon on Mount Stephens/Spirals/Lake Louise area Laggan sub.....sssst top secret.\n\"Roy, the screenshots of the Mountain Subdivision are phenomenal. Have you done the whole thing to absolute scale? What sources did you use (or are you a railroader)? What version of Trainz will this run on and are there related kuids included?\"\nLike Google real scale and detail as far as possible.\nRunning TS12 latest version 49922.\nThanks a million Roy! You are a wonderful and patient support. Everything is up and going, beautifully! Now for that latte, sit back, relax and enjoy.\nThursday Feb 27th I will upload release 1.03 of the CPR Mountain Sub. Claim yours by sending an email to me and i will link an upload for you. Have a great week!\ndid you have any succes implementing the CMTM system for our routes? let us know what the current status is ok?\nHello! Sorry for the lack of updates, but I was out-of-state enjoying Mardi Gras in New Orleans for a few weeks. :) But yes, CMTM DOES work with the routes and it works quite well actually. I had started to collaborate with another member here but he hasn't replied to my last e-mail. He had some VERY good session ideas which I was excited to work on with him. He had suggested doing multiple CMTM sessions, each one building upon the previous one(s). I will attempt to contact him again. Otherwise, I, myself, have begun testing CMTM implementation on the CPR Mountain Sub route (3-in-1) and am now trying to come up with some of my own session ideas. If ANYONE else here would like to help, PLEASE contact me via e-mail or PM on the forums.\nMardi Gras that has been a while for me.... very nice time!\nWell CMTM that sounds good, let me know when you have something for me to test here and give ideas to you as feedback. If lucky not to long we have a connection to the Laggan sub to run real CMTM!\nKeep up the excellent work and keep me in the pict.\nCPR Mountain Sub release 1.0.3 is ready for dl.\nemail me and I open in your account for dl!\nHello all! I must apologize for the delay in providing any updates regarding implementing CMTM 4 on the CPR Mountain Sub. I am just starting to get over a nasty bout with bronchitis/upper respiratory infection and have not been able to devote much time to Trainz or much else aside from sleep (and coughing my lungs out). Steve (I am now unsure of his Trainz username here) contacted me awhile ago about his interest and desire to help me get some CMTM sessions thought-out and started. I will be contacting him later today to continue to work out the details of some of his ideas (which are really awesome btw!!). Not going to ruin the surprise or anticipation, but due to the route's huge size and unique layout of industries, yards, and portals to subsequent routes that Roy has mentioned, the sessions Steve has suggested as some possibilities really do a great job of taking those factors into account.\nRoy, yes!, CMTM 4 can and DOES work with the route(s) and YES!, it should definitely be something you take into consideration for future updates, upgrades, and new routes/expansions. Steve and I both came to the same conclusion that adding CMTM to existing rolling stock is a very simple matter of just adding some lines to the config.txt files. However this poses a potential problem with the original content creators' licensing/hosting mandates. I am not sure what to do about this potential issue, but I am sure we will find a way.\nkep up the good work guys, i work hard to get the daunting task of texturing over and over again certain areas to my liking but as i get older (like all of you) every day, day by day I get more picky and say to myself time is not of the essence, quality, pride of work and fun of doing it makes the difference.\nif this continues I close the blog and concentrate only on supporting you guys my unbelievable nice cosy and great roys trainz family. SP1 is the door closer for me with trainz although I will support you guys to the end of the 5 major routes for the next years to come and look seriously for another alternative than N3V.\ni not understand what fun they have spamming this blog. there is no financial gain nor fight or dispute of any kind related unless they show their face like we do.\nugly but it seems to make them happen.\nGarbage not only fills our oceans and kills habitat.\nI just finished testing a way around the grotesque bug existing for years far as TRS 2009 and now even blocking my routes from working with tunnels.\nIt is not a copmplete guarantee it should work now for you to so pls dl it and test it once I uploaded only CPR marked as 57720_CPR. i not upgrade any smaller route instead I will teach you how to spli them yourselves from a certain release for your own enjoyment. Kepp all routes updated is to much work right now and easier to split the biog one local at your desk.\nYess, they failed to block me here is a version that will work at least it does on my computer 57720! I will now start prep upload for the route with tunnels working but its new tunnels not the old one i did change little things in the config too of the tunnels.\nOk just uploade the latest CPR version working with big tunnels in 57720 SP1 and also uploade the 577203rdparty_fix for deps new tunnels you need to dl again. sorry for the incovenience but thank N3V for all the mishap and fuzz they create and deny.\nI am not sure how to update my Rogers Pass to SP1. Please advise.\nNiels send me an email and acc namr and see what we can do ok?\nMaybe You should take a look at Open Rails when You get a few moments to spare.\nThis is where I have moved after giving up on TS12 and its \"Service Pack\".\nThis freeware Train Simulator (at 0.8 rev 1561) uses at present existing MSTS Routes, but is running on 4 cores and is revised several times each week.\nBug reporting and fixing is a breeze compared to N3V, and the team even works for nothing.\nVisual range from the CAB, where I am supposed to be when I drive a train, is 4 Km\u00b4s and can be set even higher If You want to, but 4 Km\u00b4s is GREAT sustaining a 100+ frame rate.\nThe driving experience is CLASSES Higher than Trainz.\nSorry for rubbing salt in Your wound, but my wound is just as great thanks to N3V, and You said in a previous post that You might change platform.\nJust wanted to let you know that after a fresh install of TS12 SP1 and CPR Mountain Sub 57720 I am simply amazed.\nNever before have I been able to run with 5000MT draw successfully. Usually I cannot even open up the CPR as it locks up my computer. I have never been able to run it with all sliders maxed out but with TS12 SP1 and CPR 57720 I have no problems.\nThe graphics are a huge improvement as is the sound.\nIn fact the only minor issue I have is a slight stutter when the scenery detail slider is on normal or high with the other sliders at max value. Smooth as silk if scenery detail is on low. this is unheard of on my humble computer. I will play with the slider settings a little more as I am sure there is a better compromise re the stutter.\nI have kept the TS12 pre SP1 install just in case, but I am really loving the 57720 version so much.\nI will report back after testing in a heavy yard area and with other trains about.\nThat's all for now, Andrew.\nsorry to hear you leave.\nWell if Open rails has a modeller similar to trainz or better, if the dbase of 3rd party freeware objects to choose from is similar or better, if there is a way to \"move\" \"recreate the same DEM, networks, road,splines and locations of existing objects ....what else.\nI know the problem, and there is no easy solution.\nAs for the assets, there may be a way forward. Most assets are built with some kind of 3D modeller, and if the raw files (before export to Trainz) is at hand they can be exported to MSTS as well.\nI am sure we will never get to a quater of a million assets, but right now N3V is voiding a batch of these, so..\nI not need all dls items so far 400 are faulty in my trainz dbase. ouch but can live with it for the moment.\nthanks for your support dear friend say hello home from all of us!!\nNew version of CPR Mountain Sub TS14 release 1.0.5 now available.\njust uploaded the 1.0.5 release which runs very nice and is the best ever driver version so far in 10 years! Scenery and quality is beyond expectations and a complete surprise probably for N3V too they never check or report things anyway.\nOGL is now finally the way to go and has better fps too when tweaking your Nvidia.\nPersonally I am most happy with driver as the speedtrees and my textures now do VERY well!!!\nI just made a free roam around Your route and the memory usage peaked at 2,454,000 Kb, so Trainz definately uses more than the usual 2 Gb. And, no locking or long thinking pauses.\nRoy, thanks again, I have donwloaded all 1.0.5, do I need all these if I have the previous version?\nIf you dl already earlier revs deps you not need to dl again same.\nChris thanks for the link it seems to work better than expected!\nIs there a way to undo the 4GB patch? My trainz.exe file is changed, cannot apply patch #2. Thanks.\nyou run into the same booby trap too like me.\nCurrently i make some backups of older TS212 versions to an old HDD but a slow one. After done I will than carefully upgrdae another 57720 on my SSD and install same way you do.\nI lost my major HDD backup disk incl my original TS12 files from trainz setup. Not in the mood now to see if i can dl them again from trainz... Maybe when we finished supplying N#V with all the bugs they will fix them for the next TS14 for sure and use us as their testers like always.\nthere is and never will be a rollback from them so when goes wrong you have to uninstall reinstall crazy but true as far as I know.\nkeep me us posted and you can post in roy doors thread so other can learn from it.\nThat is Your original file. Just delete the Trainz.exe and rename tha backup.\nOk guys this evening uploaded tons of kuids upgraded to trainz build 3.5 to be used in TS12 49922 and 87898.\nIf your interested dl the 5 groups on the deps page of your profile.\nRoy, just found your website by chance, looked at your route pics. they are the best I've seen. You are an artist.\nFor all those using the CPR Mountain freeware route with s301 ZR grasses which unfortunately not do the job at all. I did replace them today but the route is not updated yet.\nHere is a way to use replace assets and you can dl via your profile the Pofig-JVC frewware cdp with the grasses needed.\nI did work on a proper replacement for the S301 grasses for the freeware grass version of the CPR route.\nI thought that those from jvc in the pofig lib could do the job till one decides to change/upgrade to ST_2 grasses if he/she likes them more.\nfind near track following item \"ZR~(Gr-1)Grass R-Dark green-2 mtr\"\nopen in surveyor main menu replace assets and place this object in left side as assets to replace!\nclick current selection only to make it replace all in the route!\n\"3D1_Pg-JVC_gr1_22\" is asset to replace with!\n3D1_Pg-JVC_gr2_58 asset to replace with!\nIn case you are not familiar with I can make tomorrow a short video how to but bet you know this command how to use.\nRoy, a query please. I am in the process of writing a Session for CPR to be uploaded (hopefully) to the DLS.\nI have the freeware S301 grasses at the moment. If I replace them with the 3D1 grasses does your map still retain your kuid?\nIf I upload a Session with S301 grasses will other players with other versions of grasses still be able to download and play a Session from the DLS?\nI not have experience with creating sessions to that level of detail how trainz would handle it bit from the surveyor handling this it should work as long as the other side has the same grass it will show that grass.\nMost probably the session would have missing deps (grasses) if the other party not have those grasses in his/her dbase.\nWe have to test this and see or discuss with other more experienced session users on the forum.\nThe eeasiest and most forward way for you however would be to make these grasses Gr... now used mandatory to dl and install when someone dl your session.\nI have never used Replace Assets before so I'm not sure if it also replaces your kuid with mine for the map. That would be no good to upload a Session to the DLS.\nI'll play safe for the moment and keep to the S301 grasses until my Session is released. After that I can experiment.\nI think you are right in that another player would have missing deps but that should'nt affect the playability of the Session.\nBTW, what is the correct spelling. Illecillweat or Illecillwaet? Both are used in the map. I would like to know the correct one for use in html messages.\nBefore you release any session on the dls make sure that not inadvertedly parts of the payware route are linked or available thru the session on the dls.\nI never used sessions in depth but I think i saw once a large route file linked in the sessions data file that was the major part of the route.\nThis we have to avoid you understand.\nReplace asset is easy and handy so pls use it and let me now the new grasses do the job.\nIllecillewaet is the correct name.\nI understand your concerns about people getting hold of your route through other means. That will not happen with me. I shall be uploading 2 files to the DLS when ready. One is the Session and the other is a HTML file which will contain the instructions, messages, etc.\nNothing of your route is included apart from your kuid in the Session config.txt that gives the map being used. What this means is that if someone hasn't bought the route and downloads the Session, they won't be able to play it as the route will be a 'Missing Dependency'.\nWith your permission I'll add into the DLS description that the Session uses a Payware route only available from you at Roy's Trainz. You never know, it might bring in a few extra sales! If someone has already bought the route then everything is peachy.\nI've started the Session at Revelstoke CPR Yard and have now reached Illecillewaet (correct spelling thanks).\nI'll tidy up here and save a backup to external HD before I try replacing the grasses.\nthanks for the nice post and agree with you.\nSorry for the late approval of the post.\nMy webmaster adviced me to go this cumbersome way to approve outside posts since hackers/spammers keep bombarding the website relentlessly what fun they think they have is unclear to me but this world has more unclear habits and things happening.\nThanks for the reply. I agree with you, these hackers are a menace.\nI installed the grasses ok but what I feared would happen, did. I could only save them in a new map with my kuid. This of course is no good as I need to upload a Session for use with your map, your kuid.\nWhat I think I'll do is to continue on to Wakely and stop there. I'll upload the Session and explain that it can only be played with your S301 map. I'll wait and see if there is any positive interest/feedback before deciding whether to carry on to Golden.\nDon't bother replying to this post. I'll put future posts on the Forum and let N3V worry about the hackers.\nIf you go into the config of your session and change the route map the session refers to than, anyone who has the CPR in any form but different grasses eg should be able to run the route/session.\nWhen you have a test for me i can proof what I say when you ready.\nI have done this dozen times when a session linked to an older CPR version I wanted to link to a newer, changed the config map kuid the session has to run on and done.\nI understand what you mean when updating Sessions but this is your own kuid on your own computer and Trainz recognises this.\nWhen I replaced the grasses I can only save it in my kuid which Trainz gives me, like it or not.\nFor instance: your map 122860:100035, after installing and saving the new grasses has now become 90608:100027, the 90608 being my kuid.\nThis is fine as long as I don't want to upload the map to anywhere. It may now be in my kuid but doesn't belong to me.\nI think the way to go is to release the Session with the default map 122860:100035. I will add an instruction on how to change the map kuid in the Session to whatever they have on their system. This will not infringe your copyright as any player must have bought your original map before they can update grasses.\nAll very complicated so I'll leave that for now until I get the Session finished.\nI'll come back to you at that time to see about testing.\ndefying 58414 little critters and bugs the Rogers Pass passed my QA tests with \"flying colors\" after crashing first time after 2 hours without any normal reason than the exisitng Trainz bug.\nThe route is now ready for dl for those interested in a 58414 1.07 version of this section.\nAbout wich trainz TS12 versions support my routes. Simple and straight forward ALL releases work 100% and dependencies of the route are all working and links for dl provided. It cannot be more simple and all in one place.If for any reason you feel well with the 49922 version dl this one from your account profile.I use the 58414 as the driver here runs particularly well, but earlier versions no problem.\nCan i ask what the file size is for the whole Route please Roy ?, Like to download the whole thing mate i am on a limited wireless service here and it would take for ever to download if the Route and Deps is too big. And does it only come in a winter version ?. Loks pretty cool the whole thing.\nsorry I just now checked the blog to see for comments that need approval. Many times hackers and sorts of try to ruin one's day and for unknown reason and sick pleasure that never works at least not with us.\nOk the size of the entire route is a cdp/zip 199 MB! not that big even for a limited internet connection and my site has fast acces so dl would work fine.\nThe deps are all grouped in smaller ones and also setup to fit as you said ltd acces internet connections.\nI am very pleased to see you around here and we would be more than happy to welcome you to our community. You will love it and yes the winter/seasonal groundtextures for a auto pre and post winter experience is included.\nCheck my thread there are somewhere also winterpictures around.\nThis should get you on the tracks with Roy's trainz.\nThanks Roy i'll certainly grab it at sum stage mate, Few other projects i want to take care of first though so thanks again.\nHate to be a pain again mate sorry but can i ask one more question, If i have not updated to the latest patchs for TS12 can i still use your Route ?. Or would i have to patch to the latest build ?. Thanks Roy.\nyes when you purchase my routes it will show you what to dowload for eg. 49922 WIN and MAC version and in case the 58414 release the coresponding CPR route working/updated for the version of TS12.\nAlso I did \"update a lot of built-in and other used cdp's to actualize them as far as feasible to run well on 58414.\nthese routes look awesome, i'm currently downloading alot of stuff for other software and will buy CPR Mountain Subdivision in a couple of hours. I hope the download includes everything needed to run the route because i'm new to Trainz12. Thank You Roy for your work of Art :) Harry from Montreal, Canada.\nyou make my birthday a complete success. thanks for the very nice comment.\nWelcome to Roys Trainz and YES there is one page containing ALL needed deps at your fingertips.\nOMG, WOW! Roy you're awesome! I just finished installing \"Rogers Pass\" and I am in shock at how beautiful the route looks in TS12. Your payware even looks better than Railworks TS2014......BRAVO!\nDo you remember if I have all the routes when I bought the $70 combo? If not, which one do I not have? Curious, thank you for all your hard work and beautiful creative things.\nThe 3 in combo means that you bought the CPR Mountain Sub from Ottertail all the way to west of Revelstoke.\nI made for a limited time 3 separate \"smaller\" routes cutting/overlapping with the huge CPR MOUNTAIN connecting them via Iportals.\nThe \"smaller 3 sep routes\" where temporarily I want to allow people to taste at \"entry\" level before deciding to go for the big one.\nSome users liked the smaller ones to run a few hours i.o. of 9 up all day.\n99% bought and uses the CPR MOUNTAIN SUB.\nI did not anticipate so much work due to several bugs in any trainz version when cutting. Imagine eg deleting a baseboard does not mean all data within and crossing is deleted and you and up with \"invisble floating elements\" ouside your cut route.\nthis morning Richard post on my trainz forum threads very touching post indeed!\n\"Hi Roy and everyone else who views this thread.\n5 days ago I had been in Trainz exile for around 4 years. If I am totally honest I didn't think I would ever take an interest in Trainz again having drifted onto other things. On Sunday afternoon I stumbled across The Kickstarter Project \"Trainz Simulator - A New Era\". Initially I made a modest pledge, I liked the idea and the more I read about it, the more my interest in the future of Trainz was growing. The fire was lit and within a few hours I was back on the Kickstarter page increasing my pledge. At this point I was going to take a back seat and strap myself in for the ride and watch the next 4 weeks unfold. It didn't stop there though, I still couldn't stop at pledge number 2. I decided I needed a bigger slice of the action and pledge number 3 was made within 24 hours of me starting all this. Having got this far and making a commitment to the future of Trainz it was time to dust down my last version of the game Trainz 2009 and take a look. I had remembered fondly how much I enjoyed Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 along with Trainz classics, although if I am honest winding the clock back 4 years and looking at Trainz 2009 did little to enhance my new found enthusiasm for the Trainz Kickstarter project.\nTaking the above into consideration it was time to research the current version of trainz and try and establish what the best available routes for Trainz 12 were. This is where I stumbled across Roys Trainz and after browsing his site and the forums I knew instantly I wasn't going to wait for my Get Trainz Now selection from the Kickstarter Pledge. I bought Trainz 12 along with CPR-Mountain-Sub TS14 and It's one of the best decisions I have ever made.\nThe Route is absolutely stunning Roy and is a credit to you.\nI look forward to seeing your work hit new heights in future versions of trains.\nain't that something wow feels good and gives lots of energy.\nThe day after Dec.17th we all feel much better KS first step reached and more streched goals will make it for sure.\nThanks all the trainzers who supported vie my website and of course all those that pledged on the official KS and trainz website!!!\nFor those new to my website asking how come this blog is not very active, the reason is simple we use the main Trainz forum my trheads and thus reach at the same time other trainzers not part (yet) of the Roy's Trainz family.\nIf you like to share on my threads that you pledged also thru my routes please post over there and here of course.\nI respect eachothers privacy and not publish a list.\nHappy Holidays and Happy New Trainz year and 2014!\nwilliam asked me today in an email if my routes work on TS 12 he bought from steam.\nYes all my routes work on TS12 and all versions, see on this website when you click more on the CPR Mountain Sub it show TS12 version number and windows and or MAC version number.\nWell, finally we did it the Laggan sub section West is ready to download.\nfurther posts and comments we do as usual on the trainz forum in my threads Canadian rocky Mountains 2011 and others i opened there.\n\"I just downloaded the Columbia River Basin and it is the most amazing, most detailed route in trainz! It took me in a CP ES44AC running at track speed almost 3 hours to get done! of course I met 2 trains along the way and had to follow a northbound CN grain, but it was amazing! Super fun, super realistic, and totally worth the $25! Every person that has trainz 12 download this now!!!!\"\nMid summer for most on this globe activity still high on roystrainz!! Most users know this blog is kind of sleepy as most activity blog etc is on trainz forum so please follow up over there to avoid double traffic.\nAt this moment i try to solve a mysterious bug on a beautiful very intelligent way of session automated traffic for CPR Mountain Sub created by my good dutch fellow friend Henk. His sessions works flawless on his computers but mine seem to love to bug a few AI trains so this and next week i will try to re-create his work from scratch and will keep you guys updated on the results. In case you are interested in the results email me or post on my threads on trainz forum.\nWell we did it and cleared all winter tracks into Ottertail and further to Viktor Lake. Now ready for download is the all NEW CPR MOUNTAIN SUB SEASONAL with 4 seasons and much more and yes for future TANE use ready to migrate to that level when they are ready. In the mean time you can enjoy this gem the fullest in TS12 and maybe appreciate more now that TS12 with the so many shortcomings still is a nice piece of sim. It is sad to say how people ravage over TANE CE a not finished product (never should be released) as most trainzer have no clue what it takes to get a finished product until the final day of official release.\nSo i released yesterday some 300 plus seasonal assets. you will find them on the download page when you have bought the CPR Mountain Sub 1.0.9 look for the route 1.0.9 seasonal.\nStill some more to do but that is for later now finish the TANE speedtrees first release for my routes.\nWell at least the curtain starts moving in the TANE 3D theatre announcing wazz up and coming \"soon\". Yes they start with the Columbia River Basin followed by all the other one's all new routes so much bigger,wider,more details than ever before and much much more to come all in super realistic mode and not to forget protypical!!\nOnce all routes in TANe are out there the TS12 routes will fade out slowly and close an era we all enjoyed so much. You can post here but I prefer you do on my Canadian Rocky Mountains thread in the trainz frorum. A little bit more patience to iron out little critters and cracks by the N3V crew. they have a mountain of routes from me to get ready so give them credit and energy to get things done the soonest and well.\nGlad Roy is still up and kickin'!!!",

    "text": "An autobiography of Fran Drescher.\nGreat surprise today with the mail!! I didn't expect the book to arrive this soon! Thanks for sending it, FamFatale!!! I'm looking forward to read it!!.\nI hope your book will arrive soon too!!!\nLeft the book in Switserland with a friend who wanted to read it too. After she's finished with it, the book will come back to me so I can read it myself.\nHave fun reading it, Irene!!\nSo, E-mile, the book comes back to you in Holland and thanks again!\nFran is back!!!! My friend from Switserland send me the book back; so now I can read it myself. She realy liked it, so I'm even more eager to read it than I already was!!!\nI just loved the book!!!!!\nFran tells her story with such humor.\ngood reading material it is.\nAgain thanks for the book, FamFatale!!\nAnd there was interest for a bookring! Today Fran will go to the first person in the ring: Arja.\nHave a safe and wonderful journey, Fran!!!\nE-mile mentioned this book and I thought it'd be interesting to read more about Fran's life. Might take a few weeks, as I suddenly had a pile of ring books arrive at the same time.\nI never realized how many other shows and films Fran Drescher must have worked on, before and during The Nanny. Also, I had not expected her to be so obnoxious and eccentric all the time in her behaviour and writing. IMHO this gets a bit annoying, even though that is who she is (or how she wants to present herself).\nE-mile, can you please tell me who to send the book to next?\nGister in de brievenbus gekregen via Arja. Hartelijk bedankt voor het langsbrengen. Ben er meteen in begonnen, was speciaal even in niets nieuws begonnen omdat ik wist dat ie eraan zat te komen. Ben benieuwd. Leuk dat het boek helemaal uit de US komt!\nWhat a lovely book to read and nice photo's too! Very funny. A real feel-good-story as far as I'm concerned, really liked it.\nShe sounds gratefull for the carrier she has and doesn't take her success for granted. I'll enjoy the episodes of The Nanny even more now I know the whole history and details behind it!\nI will bring the book to Tiekie this week asap.\nGot this book today from Pietenpadje. I am very looking forward to reading this book, so I will move my other books to a dark place and settle down tonight! Thank you E-mile for this lovely ring-book!!\nI am sending this book to the next person on the list. I have got no time to read it and I don't want to keep it here for too long.\nFran arrived on my doormat today!\nI'm really looking forward to reading this book.\nThanks for sending it Tiekie, and perhaps you can still read it after me?\nBy the way, nice to know that this book comes all the way from America!\nFinished it and what a fun book to read!\nAt times I really had to laugh out loud. And it's really written in her voice, literally... you actually hear her saying all these sentences!\nThe only thing that was nagging me whilst reading the book was the way she talked about her husband and her wonderful marriage... soon after this book was published they got divorced!!\nMaybe she wrote about that in her second book? I guess I have to read that as well!\nI'll contact Tiekie to ask if she has time to read it now, otherwise this book will be off to muizz.\nFran is on her way to Muizz!\nSorry for the late journal entry. I found the parcel in a stack of mail when I came home from a couple of days abroad and then I forgot to register it. Luckily Mirre sent me a reminder that she hadn't heard wether the book has arrived. Well, it has! Probably it will take some time before I am able to read it, because there are some other books screaming for attention as well.\nThanks for ringing the book, and Mirre, thanks for sending the book and for the reminder.\nImagine you are at a dinner party and the woman sitting next to you doesn't stop talking. She keeps on talking about her career, clothes, celebrities she's met, clothes, her succesful television show, clothes, her apearance at David Letterman shows and how funny she was there, clothes, etc. You don't want to be impolite and you make some encouraging noises, and in the mean time you are looking for a place to hide.\nThat's how I felt when reading this book. Normally I love (auto)biographies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Someone who is able to spend 6 pages about the preparations for a photo shoot (how her make up, hair and clothes were) can't keep my interest. I'm really sorry. Needless to say that I didn't finish this book.\nNow the book will continue its journey. It'll go to Sarana.\nWhat a lovely and funny book! I've read it while spending the Easter weekend with my parents and I kept calling out to them \"Ooo, did you know that...\" and \"You've got to hear this...\". I had no idea that so much about The Nanny was based on Fran's own life. I loved her stories, especially the down-to-earth-ness of them, and the fact that she wasn't afraid to tell her silliest stories or show her most unflattering pictures... A very sympathetic woman, as far as you can tell through this book.\nI'm shocked to read in Mirre's Journal Entry that she's divorced now, the way she describes her marriage it's hard to believe that it fell apart soon afterwards!\nThanks for ringing the book, E-mile! I'm PM'ing Nandaaah now.\nEdit: I'm terribly sorry for the long delay, the book was mailed out today.\nAnd the book has arrived, just started in another, so I'll probably start in this book somewhere in the next week.\nI've finished the book today in the hot sun. It was an O.K. book to read.\nJust as Arja, I didn't know she did this many other shows and films. And too bad she divorced, since her mariage seems good in the book, but unexpecting things can happen. The book will be off to the next reader as soon as I got an adress to send it to.\nAnd I got the book now! Thanx Nandaaah for sending it and E-mile for ringing (?) it. I allready started in it because my last book was just finished. Fun to know that her parents and sister's names in the Nanny came out off real life. That Chester was her dog, I knew allready. I will try to finish it before the Castricum-meeting.\nGelukt! Geweldig van genoten! En nu The Nanny weer op tv is kijk ik toch met *iets* andere ogen. Bedankt voor het ringen E-mile. Ze komt morgen bij je terug.\n\"What I learned about myself, the depth of my relationships, and cancer -tests, treatment, recovery and follow-up- could fill a book. So here it is.\n* back to E-mile. <-- Fran is back home!!!!\nposted Fran today, so the ring can continue..\nFran has arrived in Gouda! I'm looking forward to reading this book and am pleased to see it has pictures in it! Is has been a while since I read a book containing pictures.\nHi guys, perhaps you already know it, but since a few weeks there is another comedy on RTL4 on sunday afternoon with/about Fran!! I saw it for the first time last sunday and wanted to let you know that it's out there.\nNa 'The Nanny' is Fran Drescher terug met een nieuwe komedie. In 'Living with Fran' is Fran een gescheiden vrouw die geniet van de nieuwe weg die haar leven is ingeslagen. Haar nieuwe liefde Riley is fantastisch, geweldig en jong, heel erg jong. Hun relatie is ingewikkeld vanwege het feit dat de kinderen van Fran bijna even oud zijn als hun nieuwe 'stiefvader'. Het nieuwe huishouden van Fran mag dan niet traditioneel zijn en soms heel lastig, toch weet ze zeker dat ze het niet anders zou willen doen.\n'Living with Fran', vanaf zondag 11 juni, 17.00 - 17.30 uur, RTL 4.\nToday Fran arrived at my doormat, together with 2(!) other books...Which makes the count of ringbooks that arrived here in 3 days: 7...I think I'll need to ask my boss for a reading leave-of-absense.\nAnyway, although not all the stories were equally entertaining I enjoyed reading the book. It was really written in her voice, like Mirre said!\nI can't wait to read the other book!\nThanks for re-opening the ring E-mile!\nI'll send it to Yinny asap!\nFound it in the mailbox yesterday!\nThank you, E-mile for sharing this book and Enitnaj for sending this book!\nYes, she is boasting about all the famous people she met, the people she knows, the clothes she wears, blablabla. But she does it so innocently, so charming, that it isn't (very) annoying.\nThis book is already on its way to the next reader.\nThe book is here! I'll start reading it right away, because the book I'm currently reading is not to my taste.\nThe book is badly damaged, I'll try to repair some of it.\nI never watched the Nanny because I dislike sitcoms and canned laughter, but this book was neat. Miss Drecher sure has a lot of energy!\nThanks for the sweet card you left me in the book Yinny! I'll keep using it as a bookmark.\nI'm mailing this book to Redfloor today. Happy reading!\nLag in mijn brievenbus. Ben heel erg benieuwd ernaar. Er zijn nog wel enkele boeken die eerst aan de beurt zijn. Dutch-flybabe, je hebt het keurig gerestaureerd! Dank ook voor de kaart.\nEdit: Ere wie ere toekomt, Dutch-flybabe heeft het boekje gerestaureerd, niet Yinny.\nWat een leuk boek om te lezen. Allereerst door het formaat. Het is een lekker kleine pocket met kleine letters. Het paste makkelijk in mijn tas, zelfs als deze al vol zat. Daardoor kon ik doorlezen in de trein. Alle boeken zouden in dit formaat verkrijgbaar moeten zijn.\nDaarnaast is het ook gewoon heel erg leuk om te lezen over het leven van een van mijn favoriete actrices. Heel grappig om te lezen dat haar eigen ouders ook Sylvia en Morty heten en dat er meer parallellen zijn. Fijn dat Fran uiteindelijk een succesvolle carriere heeft. Ik bekijk de Nanny nu met heel andere ogen. Ik ben benieuwd naar deel twee, al vermoed ik, gezien de inhoud, dat dat deel lang niet zo hilarisch zal zijn.\nHaven't read it yet but will so very soon. Thanx for sending it Redfloor!\nFran is on her way to Jordanne. Have fun!!\nI found it in my mailbox a few days ago! I think it'll be a quick read!\nThanks for ringing and sending it to me!\nOp de post naar de volgende lezer!\nHeb dit boek voordat ik op vakantie ging uitgelezen. Opzich leuk om te weten hoe de serie The Nanny er is gekomen en dat veel is gebaseerd op haar eigen ervaringen, maar dat idee van 'aan je hoofd zeuren' kreeg ik ook wel. Ik had het idee dat ik een verlengde versie van een verhaal over een ster in de Story of de Prive zat te lezen, eerlijk gezegd.\nHet boek is vandaag aangekomen.\nHet ziet er leuk uit, veel foto's.\nIk ga er gelijk in beginnen, was gisteren klaar met mijn vorige ringboek.\nDank je wel voor het opsturen en ringen!\ni received the book today.\nIt looks like a fun and nice book, i like the photo's in it.\nI am going to read it right now.\nThanks for sending it to me and thanks for this ring!\nInteressant boek om te lezen, het word ook wel makkelijk gemaakt met de foto's die erin zitten van haar leven.\nWat het gelijk ook weer leuker maakt om te lezen.\nIt is an intersting book to read.\nAlso to see the photo's that are inside the book.\nErg leuk om te lezen!! Leuke foto's, leuke manier van schrijven!!\nAnd Fran found her way back home again! Thanks for sending it, Bontekever! (btw: did you read the book? I haven't seen a journal entry of it....).",

    "text": "Thanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Lesbia makes her career dream a reality!\nWhen Lesbia was very young, her parents made a difficult decision. They wanted a better future for their family, so they moved from Central America to the U.S. to find it.\nDuring that period, her parents were back and forth between the countries, and Lesbia rarely saw them. Six years later, she finally joined them on American soil.\nWhen she started school, Lesbia couldn\u2019t speak English. Other kids made fun of her name. She struggled.\nBut eventually, she learned to stop caring what other people thought. She realized that this new country held a wealth of opportunities.\nAs time went on and they worked to adjust to the U.S., other members of Lesbia\u2019s family found Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF). They referred her, and after obtaining a work permit, she was able to get temporary child care assistance at HUF.\nHUF changed Lesbia\u2019s life. She was supported by multiple HUF programs, including Income Support, Financial Literacy, and the Bridge Program, where she completed the Customer Service and Sales Training, as well as the Patient Care Technician EKG/Phlebotomy Training. She\u2019s currently finishing a class in math at Sheridan Technical School, and has a bright future.\nThanks to HUF, Lesbia\u2019s family will no longer live paycheck to paycheck, and she, her husband, and her children will live better lives.\nThe Bridge Program at Hispanic Unity opens up a world of opportunities! With the generous support of @Citi Foundation and the Community #ProgressMakers grant, program participants have access to tuition assistance for career pathways in high demand fields, including national certifications in Patient Care Technician (PCT) and Customer Service and Sales Training (CSST).\nThanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Marisol makes her dream a reality!\nFrom Boston, to Puerto Rico, to Miami, Marisol has been following her American dream since birth.\nBorn in Boston, she spent several years in the historic city before her family relocated to Puerto Rico, where she grew up and attended school.\nAs an adult, Marisol made the difficult decision to move to Florida in search of a better future for her family. She sought more safety and security. Marisol was excited and deeply committed to grow and thrive in her new home!\nStarting fresh presented numerous challenges, however. She struggled to find work while caring for her two beloved children.\nLuckily, Marisol found Hispanic Unity of Florida. Her brother had participated in HUF\u2019s Center for Working Families program and referred her.\nMarisol took the many opportunities offered by HUF and ran with them. She received income support through gift cards, child care assistance, hurricane relief help, and affordable housing. She also entered the Bridge Program where she became certified through HUF\u2019s Customer Service and Sales Representative (CSR) training.\nShortly thereafter, she was able to secure part-time employment. Marisol says that the training helped her be more in touch with clients and better understand their needs.\nThe hard-working mother wanted to take things further and thrive in a new career, so she completed HUF\u2019s Patient Care Technician Program (PCT) at Sheridan Technical College \u2013 a highly specialized training with a focus on EKG and Phlebotomy.\nCountless new opportunities are now available to Marisol, and she plans to move on into the Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) Program. Eventually, she\u2019ll work in a private practice, and she credits HUF for helping her to empower herself and help ensure her family\u2019s successful future.\nThe Urban Institute recently released a research report titled Upskilling the Immigrant Workforce to Meet Employer Demand for Skilled Workers.\nThe report takes a look at the whole US but supplements its findings through site visits and interviews with a variety of stakeholders in three metro areas, Seattle, Dallas and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.\nHispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) participated in the study and shared with the researchers our own insights into the work we do assisting immigrants who are both unemployed as well as, underemployed.\nHow many of us know that Broward County\u2019s percentage of foreign-born residents is nearly 33% \u2013 or 3 out every 10 residents?\nThe implications are significant for our community. Our immigrant population is mostly first generation. And the needs of this population are different then communities where the immigrants are second or third generation or where the immigrants are English literate and highly educated.\nLocal communities with large foreign born residents must invest in foundational resources to assist these immigrants in their integration \u2013 which in turn \u2013 benefits the whole community.\nAt HUF where we serve immigrants from 30 different nations, our work is focused on English language instruction, education (for both parents and children), economic development (employment, small business creation, asset building, health and child care supports) and civic engagement.\nThis from the research report: This diversity within the immigrant workforce\u2014with high numbers at both ends of the educational spectrum\u2014is important context for our focus in this report on opportunities for immigrants employed in lower- and middle-skilled jobs.\nAt HUF, we simultaneously work with former professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc. as well as individuals who never completed high school. This diversity within the immigrant community requires different approaches to the work community organizations such as HUF undertakes. For us, it means providing core services that are fundamental to all clients while providing \u201cadd-ons\u201d such as information on how to have educational credentials certified for immigrants with college or advanced degrees.\n\u201cOne out of every six workers in the US are immigrants.\u201d The research report\u2019s conclusions offers guidance for all our community\u2019s stakeholders: state and local policy makers, workforce development service providers, funders and employers. Woven throughout the report are the community based organizations that are often at the frontlines of the work with immigrants.\nSouth Florida is at full employment. Now is the time to support and address the needs of our whole community including communities of color and the immigrant community.\nThis article was originally published on June 6, 2018 on the UnidosUS website.\nAs of this posting, Florida is the only state in the nation to not have a federally approved accountability plan.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) submitted its revised Florida Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Plan to the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE).\nHispanic Unity of Florida is a member of a coalition of civil rights organizations that earlier this year during Florida\u2019s Legislative Session, proposed legislation that would align Florida\u2019s school accountability system with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the largest federal law governing K-12 education. Florida\u2019s current system neglects to factor into its school grades the test scores of many English learner (EL) and Latino students, and fails to use a native language assessment when appropriate for the 10% of Florida\u2019s K-12 students who are learning English.\nEffective implementation of ESSA at the state and district level is key to ensuring that educators and ELs have the data and tools they need to become English proficient and academically successful as swiftly as possible.\nUnder ESSA, in exchange for federal funds, states must track and report the performance of subgroups of students\u2014racial and ethnic minorities, those from low-income families, ELs, and those with disabilities\u2014when assessing school performance.\nFlorida\u2019s revised ESSA plan, however, sidesteps the intent of the federal law by bundling together the lowest-performing students regardless of subgroup. That means schools that are not meeting the needs of every subgroup can still get a passing grade, and parents are not aware.\nThe revised Florida plan creates the new \u201cFederal Percent of Points Earned Index\u201d (FPPEI) of which subgroup performance and an English Language Proficiency Indicator will be components. The fact that Florida created the FPPEI is a good sign that the state recognizes its obligation to align the state\u2019s system with federal law. The FPPEI, a new section of a Florida school\u2019s report card, in effect creates a parallel accountability system. The calculation of a school\u2019s grade still does not take into account subgroup performance and English language proficiency. This decision is problematic, confusing and unnecessary.\nWhat\u2019s more, while the federal government urges states, when appropriate, to test students in their native language to better assess what they know\u2014Florida chose not to meet this requirement, despite being home to one of the nation\u2019s largest EL population.\nA recent report by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) study highlights that Florida educates the third-largest K\u201312 EL population in the nation. ELs make up 10% of Florida\u2019s student population; nearly 290,000 students. The majority of ELs\u201475%\u2014in the state speak Spanish. According to recent Florida state assessment results, double-digit gaps exist in graduation rates and academic achievement between ELs and their non\u2013EL peers.\nAs a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, it is estimated that Florida is now home to between 10,000 to 12,000 Puerto Rican students. While these students are American citizens, they also are predominately ELs.\nFor more information about ESSA and education issues impacting the Latino community, visit unidosus.org and UnidosUS\u2019s education-focused website, Progress Report: Ensuring the Success of All Students.\nHave conversations about ESSA with parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, candidates and state elected officials. Bring up the \u201cAdvocate Questions\u201d in the conversation.\nEngage parents and other stakeholders in your area by hosting an ESSA meeting at your school or a community-based organization.\nFollow and Vote: Follow what local and statewide candidates have to say about education. Vote for candidates in the Primary Election on August 28, 2018, and the General Election, November 6, 2018 who are committed to all K-12 students. As voters we can and must make education a top campaign issue this election cycle!\nLearn more: LULAC Florida will host an Organizational Roundtable and Community Forum on June 15, 2018 in Miami, at the Dadeland Marriott at 5:30 p.m.\nTo learn more about why activists are urging Secretary DeVos to reject Florida\u2019s ESSA Plan, read this Education Week article.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program offers free weekly citizenship classes, assistance with the naturalization interview and application, and financial coaching.

That makes our region, the third highest ranking in the country for people obtaining LPR status, following New York City and Los Angeles.\nIn the last decade, HUF has empowered more than 12,000 aspiring citizens from more than 30 countries to achieve their goal of U.S. citizenship. In 2017, more than 5,000 eligible students attended classes at HUF and at partnering Broward and Miami-Dade libraries, and more than 30 trained volunteers contributed more than 2,300 hours as instructors last year.\nThe Pathways to Citizenship program led by the Office of New Americans (ONA) of Miami-Dade County and Hispanic Unity of Florida, Inc. is a county-wide initiative made possible with the support from our Corporate Founding Partner Citi Community Development and the generosity of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation.

So I started googling to see if there was any challenges already out there that did what I was looking for. A few that I found wasn't really what I was looking for. I wanted to also create all the rabbit hole lots along with the residential lots with out having to move into each house and leave other sims behind. I didn't want to have to repopulate the whole town with just my sim either so I decided to create my own. So here is what I have come up with so far.\nI was requested to write down the rules for this challenge so here are the challenge rules!\nYour sim has come from an over crowded town with lots of noise and pollution. They have traveled far away from any civilization and has settled here to start over from scratch. This area has no buildings, no houses and no residents. This is a great place for your sim to start over in life and build everything from scratch from the ground up.\nPick any world you like and go into Edit Town and delete every house and building. This includes any rabbit holes.\nPick your sim either by creating new or a preexisting one.\nYour lifespan can be what ever you want, I suggest a long one. I'm using a fairy so I have a very long life span.\nYour sim will not have a job to start out with so you will need to make money in other ways like fishing, searching for flowers or gems to sell.\nOnce your sim has some money you can do other things to make money as well like painting, photography, writing for example.\nOnce some job buildings are placed you can have your sim have a job along with previous mentions of money making activities.\nYour sim can buy properties or become business owners to make money as well.\n~When you build the house to rent, you don't need to build with your own money otherwise your sim will end up spending double the cost. Build the house then go in and have your sim rent it out.\n~Once a residential lot has been created for a certain category, you can add to it later as long as it doesn't take it out of it's original category; for example: a starter home changing to a family home.\nThere can be NO residents living in the town until there is a house sufficient enough for them to live.\nFor example: must have fridge, toilet, bed and shower/tub along with all flooring and wallpapers in the home as well.\nOnce there is a place for a sim to move in, you can move any sim in you want or an immigrant can move in. No Immigrants are aloud to move into any empty lots so make sure they are all set to no visitors until a residential lot is built.\nAll community and residential lots must be built by your sim.\nAll Parks must be built by your sim.\nAll active job's that need a building need to be built by your sim.\nYour sim can have any personal life you choose. Once there are residents living in your town, your sim can date, get married, have children or your sim can live alone for their entire life. However you choose.\nAny community lot can be combined with another community lot. For example, a tattoo parlor can be built with a salon. More than two can be built together which comes in handy when your not working with very many lots in the world or it's a small island. If you do not have an expansion pack that has one of the requirement builds listed above that is okay.\nYou can only fail the challenge if one thing were to happen, your sim dies before the above requirements are met.\nThere is a possibility of any of these rules changing as I go along in my video series as I have not tested out this challenge. Any ideas or suggestions or if I missed anything in the rules are welcome!\nLet me know how this challenge is going for you!\nI started a game similar to this and had to place a few community lots and my town's main library has a city hall rabbit hole rug for editing the chances of alien abductions resulting in pregnancies.I placed skill requiremnents for aditional building and they also have to build their house first before any other buildings get built in edit town.I also did require lots for new families to have a mailbox,trash bin. wall section,burglar alarm,fire alarm,sleeping bags and laptop computers though cheap ones.The founders have to get a house built before winter arrives and survive their first winter before adding to their house and they also have to start growing plants on their lot before the second winter and new families could begin arriving the following year in late spring or early summer.I allow chess tables and martial arts equipment to start showing up after a second household is in town.Building is based on donations on community lots or taxes collected from incomes.\nI made a change in the rules when it comes to building the house you want to rent out to your town.",

At North it shares borders with Thessaly, at West with Western Greece and at South with Attica. It is surrounded by the Aegean Sea and the Gulf of Evia at the east and by the Corinthian Gulf at the South.\nThe Region has a population of 546.870 inhabitants, corresponding to 5.07% of the total population of the country. The 33% of the population in Sterea Ellada is urban, concentrated mainly in the departments of Euvoia (210.210 inhabitants) and Fthiotitda (158.220 inhabitants), the 15% is semi-urban and the 52% is rural.\nSterea Ellada occupies a total area of 15,549 sq. km., corresponding to 11,8% of the total area of Greece and consists of 735,8 million hectares of mountain area, 497,1 million hectares of semi-mountainous area and 322,2 million hectares of lowland area. The two main islands of the Region, Evia and Skyros, are pole of tourist attraction.\nSterea Ellada is the industrial centre of Greece, nevertheless it has rural areas too. It is worth noting that only 3% of the total area is residential. The main mountainous area of Sterea Ellada is formed around its centre. Forests cover the 25% of the total regional area, while 2% is covered by water. The cultivated areas of the region occupy the 26% of total area, while the 43% is used in farming activities. The Region is rich in special and rare ecosystems; 18 special environmental sites of the Region are being protected according to the NATURA 2000 framework, while there are 3 Special Protection Areas. Sterea Ellada is famous for its world-renown hot springs and spa.\n\u03a4he share of the population that is economically active is 33%, from of which 9,4 % works in the primary sector, 51,5% in the secondary sector and 42,1 % in the tertiary sector. The unemployment rate accounts for the 16,1% of the population and lies slightly above the national average. Immigration flows have importantly affected the demography of the region, as the immigrants\u2019 share in the composition of the regional population accounts for 8%, one of the highest in Greece.\nDue to favorable conditions and because of its proximity to Attiki, the Region of Sterea Ellada has emerged as one of the industrial centres of Greece with important industrial and manufacturing activities, accounting for the 46% of the regional GDP. Moreover, activites related to the tertiary sector account for the 43% of the regional GDP and gravitate mostly real estate and public services. The tourism sector, on the other hand, counts up only for the 4,4% of the regional GDP and is less developed than the national average, however, it has great potential for further growth due to the region\u2019s natural hot springs and spa (Kamena Vourla, Edipsos), archaeological sites and geographic location.\nThe agricultural sector counts up only for the 8% percent of the regional GDP% and is estimated to be subject of further decline in the future. Rural activities concentrate in the production of olive oil, wheat, fruits and vegetables, as well as in the breeding of livestock. Numerous agricultural products of the Region have been enlisted in the Protected Designation Origin EU scheme, such as, the Olives of Stylida, Konservolia of Amfissa and Atalanti, Katiki Domokou (goat cheese), Formaela (goat cheese),Fistiki of Ftiotida and Dry Figs of Kimi. The Region interconnects North and South Greece, not only geographically, but also with major infrastructure and motorways. It is crossed by the main road and rail axes in Greece, also included in the wider European Network of Transports. The transport network of the Sterea Ellada is supported by small regional ports, straits and marinas, yet of low capacity but with potential of further development. Moreover, the location of Sterea Ellada in the centre of Greece provides great potential for the development of a strong transportation network.\nUppsala University, founded in 1477, is the oldest university in Sweden and all Nordic countries.

This determines intensive research regarding ethiology, pathogenesis, immune reactivity, epidemiological characteristics, laboratory diagnostics, treatment and prophylactics of bacterial and viral infections (including nosocomial) and parasitic invasions. NCIPD is the only non-tertiary institution in the country that is accredited since 1999 by the National Agency for Assessment and Accreditation Agency (NEAA) Council of Ministers as a university in the field of infectology with rights to train students and conduct postgraduate training in epidemiology, microbiology, virology, parasitology and immunology and allergy. Long tradition is annually organized dozens of training courses for specialists from home and abroad with several hundred participants.\nIn NCIPD are all National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in various bacterial, viral and parasitic infections, united in so Laboratory test Complex (LTC), which is only for now in our country accredited by the Bulgarian Accreditation Service (BAS) in 2003 under the European requirements of standard BS ISO EN 17025 for high quality work. 1998 NRL are under constant international external laboratory control of the German accreditation system Instand. NCIPD by national reference laboratories from 1998 held a national external laboratory quality control of laboratory diagnostics performed by all microbiology, virology and parasitology laboratories in the country, with a successful result enables them to conclude contracts with the NHIF.\n2007 NCIPD was declared a Collaborating Centre of the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations on epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases and antibiotic resistance with the task of responding to these trends and training of personnel for the countries of South East Europe and Asian countries former USSR. In 2007, the National Inspectorate was set by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) in Stockholm as a leading responsible national organization etc. \"National competent body\" in the field of infectious and parasitic diseases. NCIPD, together with the Ministry of Health, performs daily broad anti-epidemic and organizational -metodichna work with highly skilled and expert advice, specialized laboratory diagnostics, organization of workshops, seminars, etc., The issue of specialized scientific and applied scientific journals as Infectology, Problems of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, newsletter and other informational and educational materials.\nIn NCIPD is performed laboratory and production activities of several original biological preparations for the needs of our healthcare and export: allergenic products for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of allergic diseases, monoclonal antibodies to determine the blood group substances and lymphocyte markers and preparations for the diagnosis of parasitic invasions. They are produced under conditions of Good Practice has been manufactured according to requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia and standard ISO 9001/9000. NCIPD carried out extensive international cooperation in research activities, postgraduate education and anti-surveillance of communicable diseases with WHO, ETSKZ, the Global Fund at the United Nations, European Union programs Phare, Copernicus, Interreg, Tempus, NATO and a number of foreign universities and institutes on a bilateral or multilateral basis.\nAll exposed convincingly shows the very important and responsible position that occupies NCIPD in national and international health systems and fully corresponds to the motto adopted and implemented daily by its employees: \"In the name of science - for the good of the people.\" NCIPD is the oldest scientific-practical institute in the field of healthcare in Bulgaria. Created in 1881, immediately after the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule, it was the beginning of the modern fight against infectious and parasitic diseases in the country on the basis of the latest achievements of world science. Contributes significantly in this regard the construction and equipment of this building NCIPD with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1932-1935. Passed more than 125 years of development, won over the years large national and international reputation NCIPD today is a major national unit in the field of health collaborators who develop the scientific foundations and methodological approaches for successful control of communicable diseases - their ethion-pathogenesis , epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics, immunotherapy and specific and non-specific immunization, according to the latest achievements of science and requirements of the WHO and the European Union.\nIn this regard they have contributed very long tradition, continuity, broad international contacts and many good laboratory facilities in NCIPD, as well as high requirements for specialists working in it.

    "text": "So, you suffer from Hay Fever or Allergic Rhinitis and are trying to decide which air purifier is most likely to help you, well you have come to the right place, we have great first hand experience of Hay fever in this office (unfortunately!) , and think we can definitely help to point you in the right direction, read on for our guide on choosing the best air purifier for relief from Hay Fever.\nWhat is the most important thing to consider?\nWhen it comes to removing tree , grass and shrub pollens the most important ingredient your air purifier must have is a good level of suction. Yup, that's right, the air purifier you choose will almost certainly have a filter capable of trapping those allergens, but if it doesn't have enough suction to actually draw them towards it quickly enough then it will not be of much use.\nHow do you work out how quickly an air purifier will gobble up those offending allergens then?\nThe first thing is to compare the CADR ( Clean Air Delivery Rate ) of the machines you are interested in. Generally speaking a higher CADR rating means quicker removal of the offending allergens in your room.\nIn order to be truly effective in gobbling up pollens an air purifier needs to be powerful enough to recirculate all of the air in YOUR room size through its filter as frequently as possible. As a guide, try to choose a machine which has enough air volume to process all the air in your largest room at least 3 times an hour. If you can get one which provides around 4 or 5 times an hour that would be even better.\nThe CADR rating on a box tells a consumer how efficient an air purifier is at actually removing the three main indoor pollutants, namely Pollen, Smoke and Dust. In this case, as a Hay Fever sufferer you should try to choose one where the pollen figure is highest. Clean Air Delivery Rate testing is carried out by an impartial and independent organisation called AHAM - a word of caution here though - not all manufacturers submit their units for certified testing to AHAM and may instead just list their own 'in house' test results on the box. If you want to be certain of what you are buying always choose a machine which has the genuine 'AHAM Certified' Seal on the box.\nBEWARE of the manufacturers over inflated 'recommended room sizes'.\nThis is where we believe most consumers get misled into spending good money on something which is never going to be powerful enough to provide them with genuine relief from their Hayfever. Manufacturers usually state on the product box and specification list that the air purifier is 'For Rooms up to...' and then quote a room size usually given in square metres (m2). This information is completely worthless unless it is also followed by another figure telling you how long it will take to clean the air in that size of room.\nOne blatant example of this currently available on the High Street is an air purifier range manufactured by VAX which on the face of it seems to be reasonable value for money. One of their units available for \u00a3199 in Argos has a Pollen CADR rating of 240. So we know it is capable of removing pollens and according to the manufacturers specification the unit is suitable for rooms up to 103m2. However, when you calculate the CADR rating and divide it into the claimed room size, it shows that the unit would take 65 minutes to clean the air once in a room that size, equating to a very poor 0.93 air changes an hour. Remember, we already know that an air purifier needs to provide at least 3-5 air changes an hour to be genuinely effective at removing allergens!\nAnother VAX unit at \u00a394.99 claims it will remove over 99% of allergens in rooms up to 87m2. Yet once again taking the CADR figure and working out the results clearly shows that this unit will take 69 minutes to purify the air once in that room size, equating to just 0.8 air changes an hour. These air purifiers may well still be effective in reducing Hay Fever symptoms, but realistically the room sizes in which they will be able to perform well are about 5 times smaller than those quoted.\nOK, enough of the technical stuff!\nTo cut through the numbers and make life a little simpler for us all, we have put together a list of air purifiers which we know will provide up to 5 air changes per hour in their recommended room size, and all of which have genuine AHAM certified CADR ratings.

    "text": "Entering the 12th floor of the Hangzhou National Animation Industry Base, the only tip-off that you haven\u2019t stepped into an internet bar is the absence of smoke. In a quiet, dimly lit room, young designers sit at rows of computers, modeling birds, locomotives and girls wearing capes.\nThis a cartoon command center, one of 16 nationwide. Set up over a three-year period thanks to tax incentives, subsidies and bonuses, the centers are part of Beijing\u2019s ambitious plan to cultivate an animation industry able to contribute 1% of national GDP within 10 years. The figure stood at 0.1% in 2005.\nChina\u2019s short-term strategy seems to be a production blitz coupled with government measures to ensure domestic cartoons are aired. China produced 102,000 minutes of animation in 2007, up 20% from the previous year and 137% from 2005, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.\nIn May, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television extended a 2006 ban on broadcasting foreign cartoons by an hour, creating a daily blackout period that runs from 5 pm to 9 pm. Stations must also show seven minutes of domestic cartoons for every three minutes of foreign output. As a result, Chinese animators claimed a 50% market share last year, up from 15% several years ago.\nBut a torrent of animation minutes does not add up to profits or prestige for most of the country\u2019s 5,400 cartoon companies. Though Beijing dreams of a world-class animation industry to compete with Disney or Dreamworks, a local industry champion is unlikely to emerge soon, as broadcasters still favor studios that produce cheaply and bountifully.\nFor televised animation, broadcasters like CCTV and provincial television stations pay studios by the minute. Higher-quality 3D animation fetches a higher price than 2D. Paying more for better animation should, in theory, attract more viewers, and allow stations to charge higher advertising rates. But state-controlled CCTV is less dependent on advertising revenue than a private broadcaster would be. Filling cartoon quotas \u2013 not boosting TV ratings \u2013 is its top priority. A survey by the China Animation & Comics Association found that only 11% of Chinese teenagers preferred domestic cartoons, compared with 60% who favored ones from Japan.\n\u201cLots of poor-quality animated TV shows are just being made blindly,\u201d said Ye Min, director of the animation series Magic Wonderland, produced by Hangzhou-based Zhongnan Animation.\nMany in the industry point to the low amount CCTV pays studios for their work as a major obstacle toward higher-quality animation.\nCCTV pays a \u201ca few hundred yuan\u201d per minute for animation, but production costs in China average RMB10,000 (US$1,500) per minute for 2D and RMB30,000 (US$4,400) for 3D, said Shen Yuliang, general manager of Zhongnan Animation. Last year, Zhongnan turned a profit for the first time since it was set up in 2005. It is rumored to be one of the only studios in Hangzhou to have crept into the black.\nFor studios, getting paid at all is an improvement over the old system.\n\u201cBefore, it was free for broadcasters to air cartoons,\u201d said Nie Jinxing, media relations manager at Sunchime Cartoon Group, which produces Blue Cat, one of China\u2019s most widely syndicated cartoon series since its launch in 1999. The company came close to bankruptcy in 2001, after spending US$8.7 million on production for a series that was broadcast by 15 television stations for free.\nThough producing cartoons to broadcast pro bono was an extreme, global animation markets aren\u2019t set up much differently. Worldwide, animation companies make very little money from broadcasting, but profit from DVDs, toys and other merchandise that the cartoon programs themselves advertise.\nUnfortunately for Chinese animators, these sources of revenue are virtually non-existent. Merchandizing is underdeveloped, while DVD sales are undermined by China\u2019s virulent pirate market.\nSunchime told Asia Times last year that it estimates the value of Blue Cat and its derivative products at US$582 million annually, but only makes US$14-29 million.\nPiracy and lack of profitability are also dissuading potential foreign investors.\nForeign studios have outsourced labor-intensive, technical animation work to China since the 1990s, but they rarely invest in the country\u2019s animation industry. This results in limited foreign expertise at China\u2019s new animation bases \u2013 one reason the industry is short of creative directors and storytellers.\nA creative vision to shape the millions of cartoon minutes into a world-class industry is not a matter of numbers.",

    "text": "\"At this point, we're more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country's AAA rating may rattle markets, but it's \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country's $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country's AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\nStandard & Poor's warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\nSpokesmen from both Moody's and S&P said they wouldn't comment beyond their recent reports.\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\n\"That's a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded \u2014 and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\nBut some investors aren't unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That's what they've done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain's stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan's credit rating in 2011 knocked the country's stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.",

    "text": "This past summer a pregnant woman was punched in the face while walking along a street in Brooklyn. She was knocked out, but, fortunately, no lasting harm came to her or to her baby. The assailant, a 33-year old man, was quickly apprehended in what seems to be a completely random act of violence.\nNo question that the attack was terrible, but is the neighbor\u2019s conclusion accurate? Should we \u2013 all of us \u2013 fear everyone? I guess, on the one hand, that we might be safer if we do: if we assume that every person, in every situation is trying to hurt us for no reason at all, we will always act to protect ourselves. We will never approach a stranger to say hello or ask if they need help; we will never even smile at them as they walk by. We will always lock our doors, our windows, our cars, and we will always ask ourselves if we are leaving ourselves open to attack \u2013 on the street, at work or school, on the bus or train, at the mall, in the park\u2026 but is that how we want to live?\nYears ago, before 9/11, I gave a sermon in which I asked how many people at that Yom Kippur service knew anyone personally who had been murdered. Out of 900 people in the room, four raised their hands. Now I ask you the same question: with the exception of the vile, calculated attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, how many friends, relatives or acquaintances of yours have been murdered, or even suffered serious injury, at the hand of a stranger?\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this before realizing that the answer, for me, is exactly zero. A relative died in World War II, and a college roommate was killed by a rival for his girlfriend\u2019s affections, but not a single friend, relative or acquaintance of mine has been murdered or seriously hurt by a stranger. When I consider how many thousands of people I have known over the course of my life, that\u2019s seems pretty amazing.\nBut is it so amazing? If we listen to the news it sounds like people are being punched in the face every day, on every street corner. However, if we remember that over 8 million people live in New York City, and another 8 \u00bd million live in New Jersey, then our chances of being punched by a random stranger on one day in August seem to be around 16,500,000 to one. And since it hasn\u2019t happened again since that day, the chances are hundreds of millions to one. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the news.\nThe job of any news organization is not, actually, to give us the news; it is to make us watch or listen or click or read, so they can sell whatever it is they sell to stay in business. Our job is to ask ourselves whether the reports of random violence are relevant to us and whether we should adjust our lives in response. If someone told me that a knife-wielding lunatic was seen in my development, you can be sure I would bolt the doors. But hearing that a man in Brooklyn punched a pregnant woman, despicable as it was, does not lead me to the conclusion that I \u201chave to be afraid of everyone.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even mean that every person in Brooklyn has to be afraid of everyone.\nFrom the TSA farce at airports to security cameras monitoring cars at Freehold Raceway Mall, we are told to be afraid all day, every day. News reports make it sound like we are lucky to get through a single day without harm. But our life experiences do not bear this out.\nYes, bad things happen in life. But far, far fewer than we imagine. The news has its place and purpose, but we should not let it define our lives for us.\n\u201cFear everyone\u201d is a terrible motto to live by. We deserve better.",

    "text": "The question arises, of course, \u201cWho are or what are they calling?\u201d Some say that the cry is for the four horsemen to come forth. Others say that they are calling for John to come and see. But it seems to me that the cry to \u201cCome\u201d is most consistently used in the book of Revelation to cry out to the Lamb to come and establish His kingdom. But when this happens, as we see in chapter six, the Lamb and His people encounter intense resistance and opposition.\nFour times, the living creatures call out \u201cCome!\u201d Four times, a horseman rides out. The first is armed with a bow (a weapon frequently associated with the enemies of God in Scripture). He goes out conquering and to conquer, we read in verse 2. Ironically, when God\u2019s enemies believe that they are conquering Him and His people (13:7), they are actually being conquered (17:14). The second horseman (v.3) is permitted the right to kill God\u2019s people with the sword. Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 10:34 are likely being alluded to here when He says, \u201cDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\u201d The third horseman (v.5) brings economic hardship upon those who follow the Lamb. They are forced to pay inflated prices or given restricted access to the basic necessities of life. This type of economic oppression is a common tactic of persecutors the world over and it grinds God\u2019s people down. It is one thing to suffer hunger yourself but to watch your children suffer hunger and deprivation because of your faith can be demoralizing and make the temptation to deny Christ all the more attractive. Finally the fourth horseman rides out (v.7), bringing disease and death to the people of God. Deprived, oppressed, and mistreated, it would almost appear that the prayer to \u201cCome\u201d is disastrous to the people of God. But then the fifth seal is broken.\nAnd so we read in verse 11, \u201cThen they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.\u201d This is how God will accomplish His purposes; through those who sacrificially do His will even unto death.\nJesus will come back. The prayers of God\u2019s people and the four living creatures will finally be answered. According to Revelation 6:11, it is when the last martyr has been killed; the last witness has been slain because of his/her testimony. Then God will say, \u201cIt is finished!\u201d (16:17), the gates will be closed, heaven will be sealed, and Christ will return to judge the world. This is seen with the breaking of the sixth seal in 6:12-14. Notice that with this broken seal, as with the previous five, there are prayers being uttered, but this time the prayers ushered forth are from those who have participated in opposing God\u2019s purposes. Rich and poor, powerful and powerless, slave and free, they, like Adam, attempt to hide from the One they opposed.[ii] As creation dissolves into chaos at His coming, they cry out \u201cWho can stand in the day of God\u2019s wrath?\u201d The answer is found in the next chapter; only those who belong to the Lamb are able to stand (7:3)! While the Church may seem to be wounded and bleeding in this world, those wounds are, like those of the Lamb; evidence that Christ\u2019s kingdom is, indeed, coming (Matt. 6:10).\nIn Acts 1:3, Luke introduces his account by informing Theophilus that in the time between Jesus resurrection and His ascension, Jesus gave commands to His disciples and \"presented himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God\" (Acts 1:1-3). In Luke 24:13-35, he recounts how Jesus met up with two of His followers on the road to Emmaus, probably heading away from Jerusalem to a place of safety. Jerusalem had become a hostile place for the followers of Jesus. They had witnessed the crucifixion of their Lord, and despite reports that Jesus had risen from the dead, they obviously had their doubts. They decided that it was time to move on before the followers of Jesus were tracked down as well.\nAs they traveled to Emmaus, Luke records that these two unidentified disciples found themselves engaged in conversation with a fellow traveler about the events that had just taken place in Jerusalem and how Jesus had been killed. The traveler listens to them explaining what they had heard and gone through. Finally he interjects, \"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\" (Luke 24:25-26).\nWith that as a basic outline, - suffering followed by glory \u2013 He walked them through the entire story of Scripture (verse 27). With Christ at the centre of it all, the events in Jerusalem began to make sense. The Servant of God had to suffer in order to be glorified.\nWhen the disciples were finally allowed to realize that it had been Jesus, Himself, who had been speaking to them, they raced back to Jerusalem to report to the other disciples what they had experienced. There they found them in a barricaded room, obviously in fear of their lives.\nAs the two disciples recount how Jesus spoke with them, suddenly Jesus appeared in their midst. In verse 45, we read that He opened their minds to understand the Scripture, \"and said to them, \"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem ( Luke 24:46-47).\nChrist\u2019s suffering and rising from the dead was to be shared worldwide. It could not be restricted to one group in one room in one city. The global expansion of the gospel would start with them in Jerusalem, but it would not end there.\nDuring the next thirty-nine days, we read in Acts 1 that Jesus went over the theme of the kingdom of God many times with His disciples. He stresses in verse 4 that they are not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the promised Holy Spirit. Telling people not to leave town may seem like a strange way to launch a worldwide missionary movement.\nActs 1: 8 reads, \"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.\"\nThe first seven chapters deal with the spread of the gospel in Jerusalem. Chapters 8:1-11:18 record how the message of Jesus is spread throughout Judea and Samaria. Starting in 11:19, the focus is the spread of the gospel to the \"ends of the earth\". When Luke\u2019s account ends in chapter 28, it does so rather suddenly as if to emphasize that the story is not complete; we, the readers, continue the mission. It is clear that Luke\u2019s focus in chapter 28 is not on Paul\u2019s fate but the progress of the gospel. The book does not close with the end of Paul\u2019s life or martyrdom but with Paul, \"proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.\" These last words stand as an encouragement for all followers of Christ to do the same as the gospel continues to be carried \"to the ends of the earth.\"\nThe spread of the gospel, however, begins in Jerusalem. This begs the question, \"Why? Why was this necessary? Why did the proclamation of the gospel have to start in Jerusalem?\" Before we address this question, however, we need to put aside three inadequate explanations that are sometimes proposed.\nFirst, the gospel did not begin in Jerusalem because it was home to the disciples and thus they would find a more ready or receptive audience. Jerusalem was not home for any of the disciples. They were from Galilee, not Jerusalem. The angels in Acts 1:11 addressed them as \"Men of Galilee.\" The people of Jerusalem could easily pick out the disciples by their Galilean accents, even in the dark (cf. Matt.26:73, Luke 22:59). Regional prejudices would not have made Galileans the most suitable messengers for the more urbane citizens of Jerusalem, nor would the disciples have felt at home in the city. Their home was in the smaller towns and rural areas of Galilee.\nThe reality is that there was only one beginning of the gospel. In God\u2019s history there will never be another subsequent Pentecost point. Every later initiative is a down-line fruition of that outpouring and obedience. We are now in the \"the uttermost parts,\" not repeating the scenario reaching of \"our-own-Jerusalem.\" Acts 1:8 is a geographical reference as much as it is a historical one.\nSecondly, the spread of gospel did not begin in Jerusalem because it would be the safest place to start and the disciples would be able to get experience in witnessing before moving on to more difficult or resistant areas. Rather the opposite was true. The most dangerous place on earth for the disciples to start their ministry was in Jerusalem. Avowed enemies with the power to throw them in prison had tried to arrest them in the garden of Gethsemane only days before (Mark 14:50-52; John 18:8-9). They would likely try again.\nThirdly, Jerusalem was not chosen to be the starting place for the spread of the gospel because the city was familiar territory for the disciples where ministry experience would prepare them for more unfamiliar ministry later on. Looking at the gospels, one finds that Jesus and His disciples spent relatively little time in Jerusalem. The urban setting of Jerusalem was unfamiliar to the rural Galileans. As noted earlier, there was a regional rivalry between those of Jerusalem and those of Galilee. Neither thought overly fondly of the other. Had Jesus wanted the disciples to start in more familiar territory to gain experience, He undoubtedly would not have chosen Jerusalem. Besides, the disciples were hardly novices to ministry. They had spent over three years with Jesus. He had sent them out on at least two mission trips already. They were fully prepared apart from one thing: they lacked the Holy Spirit.\nThe implications of this promise [i.e. Acts 1:8] are enormous. First of all, it tells the disciples that they will not be alone in the battle; the Holy Spirit will be in them and with them. Secondly, it makes them aware that this battle is actually not their own; it is God\u2019s initiative and God\u2019s action and concern. They are His ambassadors, fully endowed with His authority and power. Thirdly, whatever they will achieve will be God\u2019s achievement, because God\u2019s Spirit has acted through them.\nJesus spoke seldom of the Holy Spirit\u2019s function, but when He did so, frequently described Him as helper and comforter in persecution (Matt. 10:17-20; Mark 13:9-11; Luke 21:12-19). No wonder that Paul follows the Lord\u2019s example in his catalogue of his sufferings by attributing his endurance to the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 6:6). In Philippians 1:19, he writes, \"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.\" He reminds the Thessalonians, that \"ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost\" (1 Thess 1:6-7).\nSecond, Jerusalem was God\u2019s appointed starting place for the spread of the gospel because there were considerable missiological and theological reasons for doing so. While some might argue that the disciples might have drifted back to the comfort zone of their homes in Galilee had they been allowed to leave Jerusalem, I think it more likely that Jesus' instructions were more missiologically and theologically oriented. Jerusalem was the centre of monotheistic worship on the globe. It was the focal point of God's covenant with mankind. Christianity needed to be seen to be in continuity with what had gone on before in God\u2019s plan, rather than being potentially labeled as a Galilean sect.\nThe ultimate reason for the collection project rests upon the fact that Paul was constrained by prophecies which spoke of the nations coming to Israel to worship its King (cf. Is. 60:4-14; 66:19-24; Ps. 72:8-11). As a result of seeing believing Gentiles coming to Jerusalem (Acts 20:4 with 21:15-19), Paul hoped that Israel would be provoked to jealousy so that it might repent and accept Jesus as its Messiah (cf., Rom. 10:1; 11:11-24). Accordingly, Paul\u2019s priestly gift is the Gentiles themselves (Rom. 15:16) to verify that the God of Israel had also become the God of the Gentiles and that there is now only one people of God comprised of all nations (Gal. 3:28-29; Eph. 3:4-6).\nHence, Paul was careful to make sure to emphasize the continuity between Jerusalem and how God had worked in the past, with the present spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth among the Gentiles. The latter was a result of the unfolding plan of God begun with the Jews, fulfilled in Christ and proclaimed through the Church.\nI maintain that this is why the disciples stayed in Jerusalem, just as they had been instructed. When the Spirit came upon them, they immediately began to witness publicly, despite the risk. When persecution came, they did not scatter. They remained in Jerusalem where it was most strategic \u2013 and the most dangerous.\nThey were arrested, shamed, beaten, censured, but they continued. Eventually, one of them, James, was killed (12:2), but even then they remained, refusing to flee. They made no attempt to hide themselves. They knew that for the gospel to spread most effectively, they needed to remain in Jerusalem. It was only after an angel broke Peter out of prison and told him to leave, that he finally found a safer place out of town, but there is no indication that the rest of the apostles left or that Peter stayed away any longer than was necessary.\nWere the disciples being disobedient to the commission of Christ by staying in Jerusalem? I do not think so. They were being the catalyst by which the Church, itself, spread throughout the world. They were busy laying the foundations for a movement that would shake the known world of their day.\nThey worked in ways that consciously served to advance the spread of the gospel (Acts 6:4). They monitored carefully the expansion of the gospel and when they heard of the gospel advancing, they moved immediately to validate, bless and support it (Acts 8:14-25; 11:22). When it became clear that the churches had multiplied throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, Peter, himself, toured the entire region, helping the Church to increase (9:31-32). It was during this time, that God used him to share the gospel with the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius, demonstrating that God accepts all people into His family, regardless of race. Because the disciples were faithful in remaining in Jerusalem, despite the risks, they were in a position to walk through the door that God had opened to all nations.\nWhat are some of the common themes that come out of this survey?\nPersecution provides more opportunities to witness.\nWhen they fled, the disciples did not go \"underground\". They continued to preach. In Acts, witnessing is always public.\nOpposition inevitably followed the preaching of the gospel. While persecution does cause the Church to scatter in Acts, thereby spreading the gospel, it would be a mistake to conclude the relationship between persecution and church growth is best defined thus. The testimony of Acts is not so much that persecution causes church growth but that church growth and the spread of the gospel tends to cause persecution, as religious and political leaders rise up and try to stop this movement that has \"caused trouble all over the world and has now come here\" (Acts 17:6).\nPersecution came from various sources and in a variety of ways. The explanation for why the believers were persecuted in the book of Acts cannot be traced back to one single reason.\n 24:16 indicates that the disciples were kept from recognizing Him and 21:30 speaks of their eyes being \"opened.\" No fault should be laid on the disciples for failing to recognize their Lord.\n Steven Hawthorne, \"Acts of Obedience\" in Perspectives on the World Christian Movement: A Reader 3rd edition. William Carey Library, 1999:126.\n Josef Ton, Suffering, Martyrdom and Rewards in Heaven. University of America Press, 1997: 315.\n cf. G\u00fcnther Bornkamm, \"The Letter to the Romans As Paul's Last Will and Testament\" in The Romans Debate. ed. Karl P. Donfried. Augsburg Publishing House, 1977: 19. Bornkamm: 18-19 also makes the astute observation that Paul was obviously concerned that the Jewish Christians might not accept this collection and accept such a demonstrate of unity between Jew and Gentile in the church and so he asks for the Roman church to pray that that his service to the saints in Jerusalem would be acceptable to them (15:31).\n Christopher Little, \"Whatever Happened to the Apostle Paul?\" Mission Frontiers, September 2001: 27.\n This concept was first introduced to me by Vernon J. Sterk in his article \"You Can help the Persecuted Church,\" International Journal of Missionary Research. January 1999: 15-18, as he discussed the growth of the Church in the Mexican state of Chiapas. His field research and doctrinal dissertation on the dynamics of persecution led him to conclude that 1) the acceptance of the gospel message leads to persecution, and 2) persecution negatively affects the growth of the Church. However, he notes, the damaging effects can be minimized through an adequate preparation for, and proper response to, persecution. He also notes that an essential part of that response must be the prayers and involvement of the worldwide Church. On a personal note, my research on the biblical theology of persecution and discipleship has been born out of a desire to help prepare the church for and in persecution.",

Also named one of the \u201cTop Paying Jobs\u201d by Forbes, along with the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics reporting that employment for PAs is rising faster than the average occupation through 2022, there is no better time to get your career started in the medical field.\nNP PA Recruiters knows how tough it is to find a career in the healthcare industry. We want to help and see you succeed!\nNearly half of all PAs had a higher income from 2014 through 2015 compared to previous years with a slightly higher percentage being optimistic about their future salary for the upcoming year, according to The Clinical Advisor\u2019s 2015 annual salary survey. The average salary amongst all PAs was $105,013. The highest salaries by geographic region were found in the west, with the average being $112,119.\nAs PAs continue to play an integral role in today\u2019s healthcare industry, demand has steadily increased. Over 11,000 jobs are available on Glassdoor alone and AllHealthCare.com reports that most job openings for PAs are in California, Texas, Florida and New York.\nWith a great demand and rising salary, PAs are a necessity in today\u2019s healthcare industry. At NP PA Recruiters, our staff of professionals wants to help you find the perfect beginning in the medical field. We are wholly dedicated to identifying, qualifying and delivering healthcare providers for clinics in need. If you would like to learn more, apply online or give us a call at 956.772.1400 or 214.351.3880.\nA new survey from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners revealed that nurse practitioners (NPs) entering the workforce in 2015 might have picked the best time to jump in. The survey revealed high pay across the board for NPs along with several benefits.\nNurse practitioners are earning high wages. Let us help you get started in the field.\nAccording to the survey, 22.5% of nurse practitioners are paid at an hourly rate. For an NP at a full-time practice, the hourly pay rate hovered around $53.16. The vast majority of NPs (74.7%) are salaried, with their annual base sitting at around $97,083.\nOn top of salary, 30.1% of NPs reported incentive and productivity bonuses. Most (41.3%) received bonuses based on practice revenue or profit, while 31.8% reported bonuses based on quality measures and 27.7% received bonuses based on patient satisfaction.\nAdditional benefits reported in the survey were as follows: 71.9% of employers were reported to offer continuing education reimbursement while others offered 66.7% professional leave to attend conferences or meetings, and 54% of employers covered costs for registration for said conferences and meetings.\nPay for nurse practitioners has risen since 2013 and now is as good a time as ever to join the workforce. Here at NP PA Recruiters, we strive to not just find you a career; we find you the right career. We assign you a consultant that is available 24/7 to help you find your perfect fit.

It allows nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) an overwhelming reason to rejoice. The other reason being that both professions saw an increase in salaries last year.\nFull-time salaries increased by more than $5,000 for both fields according to the 2013 National Salary Survey of NPs & PAs, which is an annual survey conducted by ADVANCE for NPs & PAs. Pay scales can also vary depending on market conditions and employers, though information from the salary report is good news for the healthcare industry overall.\nThese figures represent a major increase from numbers recorded in 2012 when NPs made over $8,000 less than what they earned in 2013. The PA salary increase, which rose by $13,000, was slightly higher over the two-year span.\nLast year, the average full-time nurse practitioner earned a salary of $98,817 while the average full-time physician assistant earned $107,268. The results from the survey showed that hourly wages for PAs were the only ones that slightly decreased.\nIf the overall expectations for NP and PA salaries remain constant, then both are on their way to being extremely financially-rewarding professions in the healthcare industry.\nNP PA Recruiters is a full-service healthcare staffing company committed to keeping employers and career seekers informed with up-to-date industry information. Whether you are searching for a new career or are trying to fulfill your staffing needs, our consultants are available to help you achieve your goals.",

Time ta earn yer pay.\u201d Kerr commanded his Borderers. Once again the patrol paced its way along the street, the crowd thinning as they went, until there were only a very few civilians around them. Kerr tensed, his senses on edge as he noted this. Sometimes in Yordist friendly areas the civilians were warned of bad things about to happen.

Also required are two squads of ION Age Muster miniatures.\nThis mission is for two players, with one player taking a Canlastrian squad of Mustermen out on a routine street patrol.\nThe other player commands a squad of Yordist Mustermen insurgents, out to destroy the Canlastrians by any and all means possible.\nThe objective of this mission for the Yordist is to kill every single Canlastrian mercenary, utilizing the surprise blast of a concealed Air Mine and a hidden ambush to do so.\nThe objective of this mission for the Canlastrian player is to survive the initial onslaught, recover and then destroy their attackers. See the special rules for this scenario.\nA line of four street boards running North-South. It is flanked by buildings and alleyways. The alleyways are represented by 2x5 pavement sections. The Yordist player can place three Skimmers (1x2, DS2), two of the big cars (2x2, DF3) and one of the small cars (2x2, DF2) to represent market vendor\u2019s stalls anywhere on the road edges. Then place 2 debris markers randomly on each street board (use 1D6 x 1D6 to determine square, just re-roll any sixes).\nYou have a 105 point veteran squad of Muster troops. One veteran Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have four troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb or two troopers armed with two Hobbes Bombs each. Place the Scouts on any of the P1 starting places at the south end of the battlefield. On game turn one, your patrol will move north with the intent of exiting the north end of the street on the other side of the battlefield.\nThere are no alternate options for this squad.\nYou have a 96 point squad of Muster troops. One Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have up to two troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb each or one trooper armed with two Hobbes Bombs.\nYou also have one Air Mine to place, before play begins secretly designate one Skimmer on the board to be your Air Mine booby trapped vendor cart. It\u2019s placement will designate where your squad will deploy (details below). Its cost is included in the calculated total force points above.\nYour forces do not start the game on the board. Once the Air Mine has detonated and damage calculated, immediately deploy your forces as follows: Place two men in the building across the road, opposite from where the Air Mine/Skimmer was initially placed, on \u2018off-board\u2019 squares adjacent to the road (see special rules for building details and the map for an example of where these deployment squares would be if the centre skimmer was the Air Mine). Then place a stolen 1x2 Skimmer, on any alley entryway of your choice (the front of the vehicle level with the road, example shown on map) at least 2D6 squares ahead of the place where the mine detonates. The Skimmer may immediately move up to 1D6 plus 1 squares, where the remaining two men get out of the vehicle and deploy behind it. Note that on the turn of deployment the Yordists may not move. They may use all of the normal Target Response Options although the two men by the Skimmer are down 1 dice on this first turn. From the following turn Initiative is rolled for as normal.\nThere are two special rules in use for this mission. Please read and apply it in your playing of Firefight for this mission.\n1. IED \u2013 In this mission the Air Mine is used slightly differently to normal. As the Canlastrian patrol is the only one on the table at the start of the scenario, each turn before the Canlastrians move the Yordist player can move any one of the 1x2 Skimmers on the board 1 space towards the Canlastrians. He does not have to move the one with the Air Mine. He may detonate the mine on any turn he wishes before the Canlastrians move. Once detonated and damage calculated he then deploys his forces as above. This rule represents the Canlastrians belief they are moving through a marketplace, and are not expecting an Air Mine to be hidden in one of the vendors carts.\n2. Buildings \u2013 The \u2018off-board\u2019 sections between alleyways are considered to be buildings. After the Air Mine has detonated and the Yordists deployed, the central square of the building they are in which faces each alleyway and the road are considered normal entrances into the building. It costs two general dice to move through. On the accompanying map an example of these entrances are shown, marked by green squares. The Yordists in the building are initially placed adjacent to the wall facing the road. They count as being in Hard Cover when being targeted, it does not affect them firing as per the normal rules.\nThis mission is part of the Pacification Firefight 2.0 Campaign Mission Arc, set after the fall of Bosworth IV, and should be played with other missions in the Arc in the correct order.\nIt may also be played as a stand-alone scenario, in which case it may be expanded by up to two squads of mustermen per side. Or you may try using Retained posts instead of mustermen, or a mix of Mustermen and the Retained to fight the scenario. It makes for a highly entertaining game.\nThis mission is the fifth of a series of missions in a Firefight 2.0 Campaign Arc which is meant to show the difficulties faced by an occupying force in a built up area in time of war. I have drawn upon the reports of recent military experiences in the modern age and have applied them to this mission arc. When the players have finished all of the missions, it is my hope they will be enlightened to the truly difficult job military personnel have when forced by circumstance and orders to occupy and garrison a city in a foreign land.\nThis mission introduces the guerrilla or \u2018small war\u2019 tactic of ambush, which the players will find to be a very deadly game for their soldiers.\nIn play testing this mission, my brave Tocs were able to recover and fight their Yordist foes to a draw twice in three games. The third game a number of fortunate rolls for the Yordist enabled them to wipe out the Canlastrians without losing a man! Such is the fickle hand of Lady Fate.",

One or more officials will be assigned to monitor the broadcast of a competition to help identify and resolve rules issues as they arise.\nWe have our hands up for that job, although our scant knowledge of the Rules of Golf would mean that everyone would get away with anything, much as when we won a hole in match play with a par, we would offer our opponent a bogey, rather than a double, triple, or worse.\nThe USGA will eliminate viewer call-ins from the decision process.\nFor grounding the club in a hazard: Press 1. For failing to replace a mark on the green when it was previously moved to clear another player\u2019s putting line: Press 2.

So legitimate email from ICIWorld can be trapped in your SPAM FOLDER. Yet each EMail contains information for contacts for potential real estate transactions.

Make sure you always check Internet Links in each Have or Want.\nSometimes the owners of properties or the Executive Member of ICIWorld who are mainly licensed real estate brokers and salespeople are not at liberty to give you an exact address.\nThis is because there are a lot of exclusive opportunity type properties that are not on real estate boards.\nSometimes an agreement to show the property has to be put in place first before showing you the property or divulging the address of the property to you or identifying the property.\nSo you might see Toronto Restaurant $350,000 Making money . . . and that\u2019s it!\nYou must call the member of ICIWorld, develop and business relationship with him/her and go from there and give them a chance to put an agreement in place first.\nThey may have to put an agreement in place first to show you the property.\nThere are many search methods on ICIWorld to find information.\nIt is helpful for you to understand key word searching.\nThe letters otel are part of the word hotel and part of the word motel.\nSo search the subject line with these letters can find hotels and motels. Try typing otel here in the subject line. You get both hotels and motels because otel is part of each word.\nSearch the subject line and type in your city Try typing you city here in the subject line.\nNaturally you can select a Business AREA along with it, as well as Have or Want.\nAnd now with the age field you can select to search Haves and Wants 30 days old, or 60 -180 days and more.\nOld listings might be old listings but the buildings are still there, the people are still alive hopefully so the contact information can easily lead to networking with the other person to do business. This is one of the true values of this service, is introducing you to people with whom you may be able to do business both on and off the service.

There are five billion people who access the Internet in various ways and ICIWorld now makes all information available to the world to see. This brings traffic to ever single member from the listings and the links in the listings to members websites.\nReal estate has so many intricacies that it is impossible to show one way to search. This is because searching residential is different that searching commercial. There are special ways to zero in on exactly what you wish to search.

Searching advanced is different that clicking on a prepared search.\nPrepared searches are presented for you to be the fastest, easiest way to search. go to iciworld.com click on Search, click on a country or continent, make choices and bingo the results are on the screen.\nHowever some people want to zero in on things a little more so an advanced search may be in order.\nWe have heard the comment that ICIWorld is too much information.

    "text": "A new, segmented, negative-strand RNA virus with morphological and sequence similarities to other viruses in the genus Emaravirus was discovered in raspberry plants exhibiting symptoms of leaf blotch disorder, a disease previously attributed to the eriophyid raspberry leaf and bud mite (Phyllocoptes gracilis). The virus, tentatively named raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), has five RNAs that each potentially encode a single protein on the complementary strand. RNAs 1, 2 and 3 encode, respectively, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a glycoprotein precursor and the nucleocapsid. RNA4 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to proteins of unknown function that are encoded by the genomes of other emaraviruses. When expressed transiently in plants fused to green or red fluorescent protein, the RLBV P4 protein localized to the peripheral cell membrane and to punctate spots in the cell wall. These spots co-localized with GFP-tagged tobacco mosaic virus 30K cell-to-cell movement protein, which is itself known to associate with plasmodesmata. These results suggest that the P4 protein may be a movement protein for RLBV. The fifth RLBV RNA, encoding the P5 protein, is unique among the sequenced emaraviruses. The amino acid sequence of the P5 protein does not suggest any potential function; however, when expressed as a GFP fusion, it localized as small aggregates in the cytoplasm near to the periphery of the cell.\nThe GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences reported in this paper are FR823299 (RNA1), FR823300 (RNA2), FR823301 (RNA3), FR823302 (RNA4) and FR823303 (RNA5).\nTwo supplementary figures and a supplementary table are available with the online version of this paper.\nAhn K.

    "text": "Don't worry: The Italians designed the thing to look great at any of its five ride heights.\nYesterday, with a Mediterranean flourish, two women clad in surprisingly-comprehensive dresses pulled a satin sheet from a windswept lump and revealed the new Maserati Levante. It is, as Maserati will tell you, the Maserati of SUVs, though that designation is equal parts meaningful and tautology. The \u201cMaserati\u201d of something\u2014vacuums, lawnmowers, what have you\u2014might be the most graceful and sensuous of its type; were Maserati to paste a trident on a Jeep Cherokee, that too would be a Maserati SUV. With the Levante, Maserati is making a hard case for the former.\nDenuded, the new Levante evokes the shape of much more pedestrian fare: Infiniti's QX60, another wagonoid. That isn\u2019t unfortunate, just a testament to the fact that there are only so many ways to shape a sport utility. (The new Jaguar F-Pace beautifully apes the first-generation BMW X5.) With eyes stolen from Maserati\u2019s Afieri Concept, the Levante harbors as much squinty menace as its Quattroporte and Ghibli siblings and the typical Maserati cues, trident-inspired wheels, scalloped grill and fender portholes work together handsomely. Still, the Levante in person suffers some of what has undermined the Ghibli: a lack of presence. It\u2019s striking but a little stubby, like Peter Dinklage.\nDynamically, the Levante is bound to be athletic. In the U.S., it will come in two guises: The base model, at $72,000, with a 345-horsepower version of the Maserati 3-liter, twin-turbo V-6, and the S, priced around $83,000, with a 424-horsepower version of that same engine. The de rigeur 8-speed ZF transmission will be seamless; adaptive dampers and what Maserati says is the SUV world\u2019s lowest center of gravity will keep things nice and planted, like a ball of burrata dropped on a tile floor. Perfect 50:50 front-rear weight distribution is nice, and gives future owners an excuse to demand passengers take odd seats to maintain balance, like a stewardess on a small regional turbo-prop.\nI\u2019m ambivalent. Unlike the aforementioned F-Pace, or Lincoln\u2019s exuberant Navigator Concept, I didn\u2019t immediately love the Levante. Then again, I had my fingers crossed for a run of original, 1967 Ghiblis suspended over monster-truck tires, which is called \u201csetting yourself up for disappointment.\u201d To muster up some appropriately passionate love for Maserati\u2019s new truck, I talked to Giovanni Ribotta, Maserati\u2019s Chief Exterior Designer. No one can better convince you of a child\u2019s charms that its father. Here are four.\nThe front of the Levante embodies the on-road/off-road duality Maserati wanted for its first truck. A dark, carbon fiber-effect skidplate juts out a touch beyond the bumper, almost like the spoiler of a racing car. According to Ribotta, the skid-plate is self-consciously \u201coff-road, but integrated into a dynamic front.\u201d As far as hammer-screwdrivers go, it\u2019s a cute one.\nRibotta pointed out that, absent bumpers and a couple other modern affectations, the Levante is working in the same design framework as some of Maserati\u2019s most famous coupes. In his words: \u201cThe Levante shape is defined by a strong center spine and the four fenders\u2014as a racing car, from the past. Like the Birdcage or a Type 61.\u201d Does the Mercedes GLC bear the footprint of a 300SL Gullwing? We have yet to hear that case made.\nWhen asked if he might be offended when future Levante owners adorned his streamlined design with awkward racks, rails and boxes, as SUV owners are wont to do, Ribotta smiled graciously. \u201cWe did our roof rails. We designed every accessory that will go on the car. With the engineering team, we tried to make the rails as slender as possible. And as beautiful. We aren\u2019t angry.\u201d If you do buy a Levante and take the thing to Vail, you won't enjoy the transgressive thrill of spoiling a the Levante's slick design. Settle instead for a drive in Maserati's handsome stab at market share\u2014it should be a good one.\nWhat's it like inside Maserati's first-ever SUV? Find out with a 360-degree virtual tour.\nThe Bentley Bentayga Is the Most Expensive SUV. Ever.\nOur first drive goes off-road, while Bentley\u2019s styling team runs off the rails.\nBecause everyone needs an overdesigned mall mauler.\nDrive Wire: Is This Maserati's New SUV in the Arctic Circle?",

    "text": "Many favour Marangu route because it is the cheapest route to the mountain due to few numbers of days during climbing. Marangu route has been referred to as a Coca-cola route because there is no any challenge physical feature which might bring any difficult during climbing only the altitude can be a challenge on this route due to the few numbers of days for acclimatization but it is the only route which you have your accommodation in the Huts but only when you book in advance.\nOn our last day, we have a long trek mostly downhill through the tropical rainforest. Once at the park headquarters at Marangu gate, we collect our summit certificates. A vehicle will meet us here and drive us back to your hotel in Moshi/Arusha.\nYour trekking company is able to pick you up from the airport and bring your to your hotel in Moshi, if needed. A transfer back to the airport can also be arranged.\nThe transport from Moshi to the gate of Kilimanjaro National Park is taken care off. This also applies to the way back.\nUnless you are doing the Marangu Route, you\u2019re staying in our strong and well maintained four season mountain tents. Every time you arrive at your camp the tent has already been set up.\nOn the Marangu Route you will be provided with a bed in one of the huts on the way to Uhuru Peak. There are 60 bunk beds each at Mandara and Kibo Huts, and 120 bunk beds at Horombo Hut.\nDouble layered mats provided by your trekking company will put you to sleep in no time.\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner are prepared during the trek. Your trekking company is bringing their own cook. Don\u2019t be surprised when you see an exclusive three course dinner on your plate.\nDuring the trek you won\u2019t have a shortage on drinking water.\nDon\u2019t expect an extensive shower, but there will be the possibility to use hot water for a decent wash.\nThe guides carry an altitude sickness kit to monitor your pulse rate, oxygen saturation and heart rate twice a day (very useful for monitoring the symptoms of altitude sickness (AMS) at altitude). Also emergency portable oxygen is carried along. On top of that the guides are qualified Wilderness First Responders.\nThe fees for the Kilimanjaro Rescue Team are covered. This is managed by KINAPA, Kilimanjaro National Parks. Interesting fact: Kinapa means \u201cWe carry each other\u201d in Swahili.\nThe park entry fees, the crater fee, camping fee and value added tax are included in the price.\nPer person you generally have a team of 1 guide, 1 cook and 3 porters who will support you in your climb. If you are part of a group of four, you will be able to enjoy 2 guides, 1 cook and 12 porters. Although there will always be enough hands on deck, the exact amount of support staff varies per trekking company.\nVisas are required for all visitors, and cost about $50. For most nationalities it is possible to get a visa upon arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Check with your local Tanzanian embassy or consulate to see what the requirements are.\nThe total amount is also exclusive of flights to and from Tanzania. To get an idea of which airlines are visiting Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA), it is best to have a look at their website.\nYour international travel insurance is your own responsibility. It is important that your travel insurance also covers adventures at a high altitude. Discuss your itinerary with the insurance company before you travel to Tanzania.\nTips for guides and porters are exclusive. You decide what you want to tip, but be generous and read our blog post about tipping when you are planning go trekking in Tanzania.\nWhether you stay in Moshi, Arusha or anywhere else, before and after the trek you have to take care of your own accommodation and meals.\nWhile the intention is to stick to the described route, a certain degree of flexibility is built in. In some cases it may be necessary to change the route here and there. The mountains are full of surprises, and the weather on Mount Kilimanjaro is unpredictable. The guides continuously carry out risk assessments throughout the expedition. It is therefore best to plan a number of extra days in Tanzania to cover for possible unforeseen circumstances. Read all about altitude sickness here.\nUnless you are choosing the Marangu Route, you will be staying in durable tents that are equipped for all weather situations. A few porters will always trek ahead of you to make sure that your tent is ready when you arrive. There will also be tables and chairs. Accommodation comes with freshly prepared meals. Every campsite has a long drop toilet. Along the trek you can find your private space behind a rock. Read all about camping on the Kilimanjaro here.\nDo you reach Uhuru Peak or not? There is a chance that you won\u2019t. Often this depends on the unpredictable weather on the mountain. However, it can also depend on your own physical condition.\nDo you enjoy hiking, have you gone trekking at higher altitudes and do you exercise twice a week on average? With a little extra training, you are soon fit to challenge Mount Kilimanjaro.\nIs this the first time that you are trekking at altitude? Make sure you are well prepared. This is important for your safety, but also for that of your team. Make sure you start six months in advance with an hour\u2019s walk or hike twice a week. Read this blog post and get fit for your Kilimanjaro ascent.\nTrekking in Kilimanjaro requires decent gear. Especially the basics like an 80-90l backpack and quality trekking socks. Also make sure to check our ultimate packing list for trekking Kilimanjaro.\n\u2013 Duffel bag, (waterproof recommended) for porters to carry your equipment.\nBecause Mount Kilimanjaro covers a relatively large surface area and a lot of elevation, the mountain has more or less its own climate. Responsible for the weather patterns around Mount Kilimanjaro are trade winds that bring along moist from the Indian Ocean. Because of these trade winds, the months of March, April, May and November are the wettest. The southern mountain slopes are especially rainy in these months. From January to March there is a greater chance to see snow on and around the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. This can be experienced as negative, but it will any case be much quieter on the trails. Although these are the coldest months, snowfall and cold temperatures can be expected from December to May. The most suitable and most popular season for climbing Kilimanjaro is from June to October. In these months you can choose any route without having to worry about rain too much. If you want a comfortable route during the rainy season, you best choose the Rongai Route, approaching Kilimanjaro from the North. Due to the differences in altitude and the associated climate zones, it is difficult to estimate the temperatures.\nTrekking on Kilimanjaro is hard, both for yourself and your support staff. Per person you have a team who will support you in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. This team usually consists of a guide, three porters and a cook. This way you don\u2019t have to carry your full gear yourself. The guide speaks English and usually the rest of the team speaks English as well. You can make things more interesting by learning a few words of Swahili in advance.\nBookatrekking.com strives to only work with providers who treat porters in a fair manner. Without porters, there is no trekking on Kilimanjaro. They are the heart and soul of your adventure and every day, they carry part of your gear. Bookatrekking.com always tries to find a balance between an affordable trekking adventure and the fair treatment of porters. Read everything about porters on Kilimanjaro here.\nIt is impossible to climb the Mount Kilimanjaro solo. This means that every climber has his or her own team. Both the guide, the assistant guide, the porter and the cook expect a tip. For the whole trek, this sums up to an amount ranging from USD 330 to USD 450. This is per climber, which means that the amount will not be smaller if the group is larger. Be generous. Read our extensive blog about tipping on Mount Kilimanjaro.\nThe currency of Tanzania is the Shilling. We recommend you bring US dollars or Euros to cover the costs of your visa, extra travel, and other. It is easiest to travel in Tanzania with US dollars, but credit cards are also accepted in most places.

Press ESC to return to the original format.\nNote: Google Earth software reads the actual topography and ignores roads, cuttings, tunnels, bridges and excavations. The Google Earth vertical-profile animation generates a number of parallax errors, so the profile is only a general guide of what to expect in terms of gradients, distance and elevation. The graph may present some impossible and improbably sharp spikes, which should be ignored.\nGetting there: To approach from the northern side, the pass can be accessed off the R407 about 4 km south of Prince Albert. It is clearly signposted and easy to locate. Head south on the R328 for 2,3 km where the road crosses the Dorpsarivier via a concrete bridge. This point marks the northern start of the Swartberg Pass. This is the direction in which we filmed the pass.\nEerste Water in the northern sector of the pass makes for a perfect spot / Photo: Trygve RobertsFor those wanting to approach from the south, there are a number of options, but we will describe here the obvious main route. Drive north from Oudsthoorn on the tarred R328 via Schoemanskloof. Just after the Wilgewandel Guest Farm (with the camels) there is a fork in the road. The right hand fork heads directly to the Cango Caves. Turn left here (GPS S33.402020 E22.216309) The road (still tarred) heads east for a further 13 km where another guest farm is reached called 'Cobus se Gat'. This marks the southern start of the pass. The road becomes gravel after a further 2 km.\nThe nearest town is Prince Albert - just 4 km from the northern end of the pass. There is plenty see, from flora to fauna, and some mind boggling geology. The fynbos is at its best in winter and spring with proteas, ericas, restios and pin-cushions in profusion.\nThe pass is a national monument and, like its sister pass (Montagu Pass), stands in proud defiance of modern technology. It would be a shame if these roads were ever tarred as their core charm would be lost forever. A plaque commerorating the efforts of the men who built the pass was unveiled on the pass's centenary celebrations in 1988. It stands at the western side of the road at the summit. This was the last pass that Thomas Bain built in the Cape and it was surely his opus magnum. The final cost of the pass, including a few kilometers of access roads, was 14,500 Pounds Sterling, excluding the value of the convict labour, which was free.\nFrom the northern start at the crossing of the Dorpsrivier, the road traverses a short stretch of open plain, but the massive bulk of the looming Swartberg blocks the way ahead, other than a single, narrow gorge through which the road winds. The highest peak visible at this stage is unnamed at 1532m on your left (east), whilst the slightly lower Voetpadsberg on the right (west) tops out at 1402m.\nAmazing geology on display in the northern sector / Photo: Trygve RobertsA low dry packed wall appears on the left as the mountains begin hemming the river and the road in. These walls are the first of hundreds of such examples that you will see along the length of the pass. They were the work of Thomas Bain, then at the height of his engineering prowess as a road builder. The small river, which appears as a docile litlle stream, becomes a raging and destructive torrent when flash floods occur.\nDuring the night of April 10th, 2017, such a flash flood, swept down the kloof, destroying everything in it's path. Thomas Bain's retaining walls, which had been standing guard against the river for 130 years, buckled under the might of the river and the 2 km section of road from Malvadraai through to the northern exit of the poort were completely devastated. It took modern equipment and techniques almost 10 months to repair most of the damage, taking due care to rebuild the wallls to appear as close to Bain's original work as possible.\nThe Swartberg Nature Reserve is large - (180,000 hectares) and provides hiking, picnicking, 4x4 routes, bird-watching, swimming and just being close to nature.\nThe majority of the pass falls within the control of the Swartberg Nature Reserve / Photo: SA VenuesThe moment the kloof is entered, the sunlight is blocked off and the mountains tower vertically up on either side of the road in a dazzling display of contorted sandstone. The rocks often appear blood red, depending on the time of day. The photographic opportunities are endless and there are enough places to pull off the narrow roadway and park safely.\nSome bluegum trees appear on the left and a clearing pops up on the right - a large flat clearing where some ruins are evident. Apparently the house was used by Bain as a work station during the construction phase. Immediately after the clearing, the road bends sharply to the left and approaches the second river crossing via a concreted drift. This is normally shallow and should present no problems for any vehicle. This lovely spot is known as Eerste Water (First Water) and was the first point where oxen and horses could be watered, before tackling the big climb to the summit. There is a rock near this spot - a tall thin slab of rock, which looks like a clock. There is lots of shade at this spot and it makes for a great picnic spot and is well protetcted from the wind too.\nThe pass in the 1800's with its designer - Thomas Bain / Photo: Swartberg Mountain ToursOnce over the river, the road bends to the right and follows the eastern bank of the river. The road has been hewn out of the mountain here and is very narrow. If you meet an approaching vehicle, one of you will need to reverse to a wider section to facilitate passing.\nSoon the road crosses the river for a third time, this time via a low level concrete bridge, which is called Tweede Water (Second Water). Around the next corner is another excellent picnic spot, named Malvadraai. (Wild Geranium Corner) - so named for the wild geraniums that grow there. The section from Tweede Water to Malvadraai also got severely damaged during the 2017 flood.\nOn the left hand side (east) of the river, you will notice a footpath snaking up the mountain-side towards a saddle. This is the 6 hour Malvadraai Hiking Trail and is apparently a lot tougher than its gentle name suggests. Malvadraai is a rest area next to the river, where one normally finds wild geraniums at any time of the year. The river is spotlessly clean and this is a good spot to have a swim on a hot summers day.\nThe road now enters a series of S-bends, and swings away into the south-west up a major kloof, known as Mullers Kloof. This kloof also gave Bain the most trouble. In May 1885 a devastating flood swept across the Swartberg Mountains, washing away most of the road in the adjacent Meiringspoort and causing a long closure. Bains' brand new road also suffered damage, but Bain learned his lessons well and rebuilt the damaged sections of road further away from the river's flood levels.\nThe road also begins climbing more steeply here, reaching a gradient of 1:9. At the 4,4 km mark, there is a layby on the right, which allows access to the ruins, marked as Blikstasie. These ruins were once the convicts home, who constructed the pass.\nAccess to the ruins is awkward and requires some physical effort. Shrubs and trees have overgrown the ruins, but if you have the physical capacity to scramble the few metres up the slope, you will be rewarded with a perfect view of the old walls. These are approximately 2ft thick and consist of rocks and stones held together by mud. The building apparently had an iron roof, hence the name Blikstasie (Tin Station).\nFrom the ruins, if you look up the slope to the left of the road, you will get perfect views of the massive retaing walls that support the road ascending up Mullers Kloof. These are the most impressive of all the walls and at places reach a height of 13 metres! This is also the kloof that was featured in the TV commercial with well known South African singer, song-writer, playwright and actor - David Kramer, chasing his beloved Volksie Bus up one of the hairpins in his trademark red \"veldskoens\".\nThe road climbs steeply into the south-west towards a huge slab of exposed and contorted rockface. It is marked as Droe Waterval (Dry Waterfall) as most of the year this riivulet is without water. If you get to drive this pass around sunset, this rock face glows a deep and fiery red in the setting sun and has earned itself the nickname of \"Wall of Fire\"\nHere you are likely to see baboons and klipspringers, the latter which seem to float up the mountainside with no apparent effort.\nIf you have the time, you will see that as part Bain's dry-walled roads, he constructed underground tunnels to disperse flood waters. The man was a genius and way ahead of his time. An example of this work can still be seen at the \"Droe Waterfall\" which is mostly just a trickle (and aptly named), but when the heavy rains arrive, the gorge is filled with a destructive torrent of white water, capable of sweeping away even the largest of rocks.\nAt Droe Waterval the road curves sharply through 120 degrees to the left and climbs steeply in the process, reaching a gradient of 1:8. Coming up are the famous four hairpins that feature in so many photos of the Swartberg Pass. Drive slowly and carefully and be constantly aware of approaching traffic as the road is narrow here and both vehicles will need to move as far left as possible and pass each other at a crawling speed. Some drivers get so engrossed in the scenery that they forget to keep left. Be constantly aware of meeting an oncoming vehicle on the wrong side of the road.\nThere aren't many places to pull over safely, but there is one good spot right before the third hairpin, which allows a wide scope for photography. It's a great spot to stop and breathe in the clear mountain air and savour the majesty of the impressive landscape. This is one of the Top 5 highlights of the Swartberg Pass.\nOnce up onto the ridge, the gradient eases off a bit to around 1:14 and follows the spine of a long ridge, as the road climbs inexorably towards the viewsite known as Teeberg. The road is wider here and passing oncoming traffic is easier. The Teeberg viewsite is located at the apex of a very sharp right hand bend of 160 degrees. It's at an altutude of 1394m exactly 9 km from the northern start. There is a concrete picnic table here and sufficient parking for about 6 vehicles.\nThe name Teeberg does not appear on any of the topographical maps and the mountain spine that leads upwards terminates at 1535m and is actually called Platberg.\nLooking north one gets a majestic view over the 500m deep chasm that runs all the way down to Malvadraai. The views are quite amazing and if you arrive at this view site on a wind free day, it is a marvellous place to find your soul. The views are 360 degrees and offer so much variety that it's almost impossible to take it all in.\nCautionary: There have been a few incidents on this pass, where people have left there vehicles to take a photograph and not fully applied the handbrake and in one instance, not at all.\nA minivan rolled almost 400m down the cliffs and was obviously a total write-off. Luckily the occupants were out of the vehicle at the time. When stopping at any of the viewsites, it is best practice to switch the engine off, engage 1st or reverse gear if manual, and PARK if automatic PLUS fully apply the handbrake.\nThere are baboons, grysbok, grey rhebuck, klipsringer, leopards and caracal - with the last two seldom being sighted. The road is narrow in certain sections and some reversing might be required to get past an oncoming vehicle. Etiquette is to give way to the ascending vehicle. There are no heavy vehicles or caravans allowed.\nDrive at the speed limit or slower - this road can be dangerous in bad weather. If you plan on stopping at the top for a photo or two, have a windbreaker ready - it can be ice cold out of the car and almost always windy.\nFrom Teeberg the road heads due west as it skirts a side ravine and maintains a fairly level altitude. At the 9,9 km mark, there is a sharp left hand bend, which changes the direction into the SSE, as a flatter section of the upper plateau is traversed. Here the mountain slopes are covered in dense stands of proteas and ericas and if you visit in winter or spring, you will be richly rewarded.\nThe road starts climbing again at a gradient of 1:16 and an intersection is reached at the 10,8 km mark, with another gravel road heading away into the west. This is the turn-off to the famous Gamkaskloof . It is not recommended to drive this road unless you are well prepared, have sufficient fuel, knowledge, and preferably have booked accommodation overnight at Die Hel. This road is slow and a lot rougher than the Swartberg Pass.\nCAUTIONARY: Do not drive this road (Gamkaskloof/Die Hel) unless you have a high clearance vehicle and preferably a 4x4. It is a minimum of a 4 hour trip there and back excluding any stops. It is far better to prebook accommodation at Die Hel and overnight there. The road is a dead-end and consists of about 9 small passes and one big one at the end (Elands Pass). You will be doing this route an injustice by attempting to drive it in a single day. This road is much rougher than the Swartberg Pass.\nSign at the summit now obliterated with stickers / Photo: Sncdn.comAfter negotiating another big right hand bend of 140 degrees and at the 10,8 km mark, the buildings of the old toll house and Swartberg Nature Reserve appear at the next bend. These are used by hikers tackling the Swartberg Hiking Trail.\nThe road now swings through another big S-bend which brings the heading into the east, as the next set of switchbacks begins at the 12,4 km point.\nYou will also notice a locked and gated jeep track heading eastwards just after the picnic spot. This is a known 4x4 route which is some 75 km long. Permits can be obtained from Cape Nature and/or the Swartberg Nature Reserve. There is a minimum number of vehicles required per trip for safety reasons. Immediately before the jeep track junction, some green roofed buildings appear on the left of the road, almost directly below the pass summit. This was originally the site of the road camp where the convicts were housed and perished that snowy night 120 years ago, when their roof caved in. Today, the buildings have been restored and serve as an information centre for the Swartberg Nature Reserve, as well as an overnight hikers hut and a tearoom.\nThe next set of switchbacks consists of four hairpins and whilst they are most impressive, they are not quite in the league of those in Mullers Kloof. The road is also not so narrow and there are more opportunities to stop for sight seeing and photography.\nLooking south from the summit of the pass / Photo: BlogsausbettiesThe third hairpin changes the heading into the west, as the final pull up to the 1575m summit is tackled. Be prepared for cold, blustery conditions at the summit and be aware that there is limited parking. A sticker plastered sign announces: '\"DIE TOP\". This is not the optimum view site on the pass and the weather often spoils things as the wind can really howl through the neck, often reaching gale force conditions. It is much better to stop at one of the three viewsites along the southern descent.\nFrom Die Top, which is a natural saddle in the mountain, you will have expansive views to the south of most of the Klein Karoo, with it's patchwork of green farmlands, whilst the northern vista is entirely different, displaying much drier mountains with a massive gorge splitting the upper mountain plateau into two. It is along the western side of this gorge, that the road has delivered you. From the summit point, the road can be visually traced all the way back to Teeberg. If you are lucky enough to be at the summit alone, switch your car's engine off and listen to the incredible silence or the wind whistling past the rocks at Die Top.\nThe moment the road curves through the sharp left hander at the summit, huge views of green fields and distant grey mountains open up. It is completely different to what has been on offer for the previous 40 minutes. All along the descent there are wonderful examples of Thomas Bain's perfectly constructed dry packed walls.\nPerfect examples of the dry packed supporting walls on the southern side / Photo: PanoramioThe descent is mainly into the east and other than dozens of bends, corners and curves, this direction is maintaned all the way to the valley floor. Maintain a slow and steady speed and make sure you keep well left on all the blind corners.\nCAUTIONARY: The Swartberg Pass is enormously popular with both local and international travellers as can be attested by the many hire cars that can be seen on the pass 7 days per week. Tourists tend to drift completely onto the wrong side of the road as they take in the grand scenery. On the day of filming we had two incidents where we would have had head on collisions, had we been driving faster. Be extra vigilant, blow your hooter as you enter a blind corner, drive with your headlights on and anticipate.\nThere are four view/picnic sites on the southern ascent. If you are planning a picnic, the lowest site might be the most pleasant, as there is nearly always strong wind and cooler temperatures near the summit. The descent lasts for 10,3 kms and should take about 20 minutes to drive excluding stops. Although the pass carries the route number R328 it's administrative number is P0369.\nThe second view site, named Skelmdraai is very good (if the wind is not blowing) with wonderful views and sufficient parking space for about 5 vehicles. From this site, there are excellent perspectives of Bain's propped up walls that run for 2,3 kilometres without a break.\nAt the 18 km mark, there is a substantial ruin on the left hand side of the road (north), followed soon by a big picnic and view site. This is the last view site along the descent, if you intend taking a break. There are another four hairpins coming up, which commence at a ruin called Stalletjie, followed in quick succession by Witdraai. These start at the 20,4 km mark.\nNear the southern end of the Swartberg Pass looking west/ Photo: Thorsten KuttigThe road begins flattening out a little and the road surface improves as the foot of the pass is approached. After the last hairpin (which clears a side ravine), the road changes direction into the south and the road surface switches to tar at the 23,3 km point. The descent gradient remains reasonable and soon a large guest farm makes its appearance on the right hand side, which is Cobus se Gat. This is a good place to get some refreshment, reinflate your tyres and savour all the wonderful memories of driving the amazing Swartberg Pass.\nAs you exit the final section of the pass and access the tar, you will be left with a feeling of awe, relief and disappointment all in one. Relief that you made it through without mishap and disappointment that it's all over. This pass ranks amongst the top 10 South African passes in terms of the total package. There are others which are higher, longer, sharper, more dangerous, but there is only one Swartberg Pass. This is the one pass you must experience at least once in your lifetime.\nIt leaves one with the sense that those responsible for naming the various points up the pass, had exhausted their creative energies by the time they reached the summit (1575m ASL) as the best name they could come up with was Die Top. It must have been a monumental effort.\nThe pass is a national monument / Photo: GoogleHistory: Thomas Bain, with the help of some 250 convict labourers built the pass from 1883 to 1886. He managed to keep the gradient lower than 1:8 throughout the pass, compared to the steeper 1:6 of the Montagu Pass. Bain cleverly used the ridges of the foothills for a comfortable 'altitude gaining' approach to the looming bulk of the Swartberg range, where he chose the lowest saddle as his target.\nIt was tough going and there are many stories that abound about the hardships endured by these pioneering men. When the crest of the pass had been reached during the second winter, a road builders camp had been set up close to the summit. After a particularly heavy snowfall, the roof of the camp collapsed, killing several of the convicts.\nBy this stage of his road building career Bain had developed several unique techniques employing his knowledge of science. One was his dry-walling construction using the principles of cohesion and friction, using no cement at all. This technique was first brought into South Africa by John Montagu and Charles Michell and the first known examples of dry walling to support roads dates to the Montagu Pass (built by Michell) and Bainskloof (built by Thomas Bain's father, Andrew Bain).\nThe other was using heat and water to break big rocks up. A large fire would be lit under or near a difficult rock and then cold water would be poured over it, resulting in the rock cracking into smaller, more manageable pieces. Thomas acquired most of these skills from his father, (and to whom he was apprenticed for a several years), who had an intimate understanding of geology. In these early pioneering days, the tools employed were very rudimentary and consisted primarily of picks, shovels, sledgehammers, gunpowder and hard labour.\nZoom in and out; rotate in any direction.\nUse the Get Route'feature (directly beneath the map): type in your address to get a personalised route straight from where you are to the pass, with time and distance included.\nDetailed written and printable directions.\nDrag the 'little orange man' icon onto the pass for a complete 360\u00b0 tiltable \"street view\".",

Bound in contemporary limp vellum, manuscript title on spine, remnants of ties, red sprinkled edges. Minor soiling and edge wear to binding, front pastedown torn and unglued, book labels of the historian J. B. Bury (861-1927) and Michael Bury (on the front flyleaf) and of the 19th-century English bookseller Samuel Maynard (inside upper cover).

II.42, minor wrinkling and small marginal tear in first quire of Book II, final leaf backed and with moderate toning.\nVery rare, with only one recorded copy in America (Harvard), the first complete edition (see below) of the sculptor and goldsmith Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s (1535-1600) highly influential treatise on the practice of art and architectural theory extensively illustrated with more than 300 woodcuts. This work is important for being \u201cthe first printed and illustrated treatise on artistic anatomy\u201d (Skaarup, 254) and the second published original architectural treatise composed in Spanish, following only Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526). Remarkably (and rather mysteriously), some two dozen of Arfe\u2019s anatomical woodcuts in this work are derived from drawings by Leonardo da Vinci (via intermediary copies), providing a fascinating example of how Leonardo\u2019s graphic work circulated in the wider European art world centuries before his drawings were published (Skarrup, 353-4; R\u00f6hrl, pp. 40-96, 142-45). The De Varia Commensuracion para la Esculptura, y Architectura (1585-7) \u2013 which covers in its four books geometry, human anatomy, the proportions of quadrupeds & birds, as well as classical architecture & contemporary Spanish metalwork \u2013 was the \u201cmost frequently republished\u201d and consulted treatise on artistic practice and theory in Spain up to the turn of the 19th century (see Bonet Correa, p. 145), appearing in ten editions, the early ones being very rare. Its continuing influence has been recognized by its widespread inclusion in libraries of early Hispanic artists on both sides of the Atlantic, characterized by a \u201cmasiva presencia de Vitrubios, Vignolas, Serlios y Arfes\u201d (Soler I Fabregat, p. 149 and passim). The painters Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Alonso Cano are but a few known to have owned a copy of Arfe (Fajardo, 88-90).\n\u201cThe success of the Varia in Spain and in Latin America was extraordinary, being a compendium in a single volume of distinct fields of artistic and scientific knowledge, the borders of which were not at the time established with the same categorical precision as they are today\u201d (Bonet Correa, 157). Books Two and Four are the two most historically influential parts of the Varia. Book Two, on human anatomy, is divided into four subchapters on proportion, osteology, myology and foreshortening of the human figure. Arfe claims here a number of influences, including D\u00fcrer\u2019s treatise on proportion (1528) and Juan Valverde de Amusco\u2019s interpretations of Vesalius\u2019 Fabrica, but he also mentions the artists Pollaiuolo, Baccio Bandinelli, Raphael, Donatello, Mantegna, Michelangelo and the Spaniards Pedro Berruguete and Gaspar Bezerra (ff. 1v-2v). Arfe comes to the practice of artistic anatomy having spent time as a student training in the dissection theater under the direction of the famed physician Cosme de Medina (d. 1591) at the University of Salamanca (f. 25v), leading scholars to remark that \u201cNowhere in an Iberian context was the close, even dependent, relationship between anatomists and artists more evident than in Juan de Arfe y Villafa\u00f1e\u2019s Varia \u2026 the Libro segundo is a rare and unique source produced by an anatomically trained artist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 246). According to Choulant, the Varia \u201cshould\u2026 be considered the earliest of the numerous works which dealt with anatomy for graphic and plastic artists\u2026\u201d (Choulant, p. 32).\nBook Three of the Varia, on the proportions of animals, draws heavily from Conrad Gessner\u2019s four-volume Historiae Animalium (1551-8) and includes, along with depictions of more common birds and quadrupeds, the images of an elephant, camels, ostrich, and D\u00fcrer\u2019s famed rhinoceros. Arfe\u2019s horse recalls the equestrian statues of the Italian Renaissance and serves as a reminder that establishing the precise proportions of the horse was also a preoccupation of such artists as Leonardo (in the Codex Huygens) and Sebald Beham (Proporcion der Ross, 1528).\nIn Book 4, Arfe writes of the Roman ruins in Spain, the architecture of Bramante, Baldassare Peruzzi, and Alberti, as well as modern Spanish architects and those goldsmiths whose work (on liturgical vessels) can be characterized as \u2018micro-architecture,\u2019 beginning with the metalwork of his grandfather. Arfe illustrates the classical Orders based on Serlio, adding a sixth \u2018Attic\u2019 order, and treats various aspects of architectural ornament. At the time of its publication, the Varia was only the second original architectural treatise composed in Spanish \u2013 following Diego de Sagredo\u2019s famed Medidas del Romano (1526) and derivative works of translation such as Villalpando\u2019s Tercero y Quarto libro de Serlio (1552), Zamorano\u2019s Diez Libros de Architectura of Alberti (1582), Miguel de Urrea\u2019s Vitruvio (1582) (Fajardo, 130; Bonet Correa, 158). \u201cArfe\u2019s treatise, with its more timeless character, transcended its own era\u201d (Bonet Correa, 158). Although the Medidas del Romano of Diego Sagredo appeared in three Spanish editions and further French and Portuguese translations, its emphasis on the \u2018Plateresque\u2019 style of architecture contributed to the waning of its popularity during the 17th century, even as the popularity of Arfe\u2019s treatise increased.\nArfe extends Book 4 with a highly original discussion of metalwork, in which he aligns his own specialty with the more theoretically sophisticated field of pure architecture. His woodcuts of liturgical items (monstrance, chalice, aquamanile, crosier, crosses, candelabra, censer, etc.) are given a rigorous proportional treatment, with more sophisticated \u2018micro-architecture\u2019 custodias being shown in plan as well as in elevation, in the manner of full-scale buildings. Some of these illustrations depict surviving works by Arfe, while others are taken to be designs for lost or still unidentified pieces. It should be noted that while Arfe \u2013 despite the popularity of his treatise \u2013 perhaps was unable in his time to elevate his craft as a theoretically complex art alongside painting, sculpture and architecture, in recent times, art-historical research has vindicated his contention that metalwork of the highest quality should be prized not only for its pure material value and symbolic-liturgical importance, but also for its participation in the wider debates about the nature of representation, the supremacy of panting vs. sculpture vs. architecture, etc.\nBooks One, Two and Four of the Varia are dated 1585 on their colophons, while Book 3 is dated 1587. The first two books are occasionally found bound without Books 3 and 4, and it is surmised that the final two books appeared in 1587 (in spite of the 1585 date on Book 4), after an interruption in printing caused by a fire or a controversy about privileges, at which point the complete work was bound together as seen in the present copy (Fajardo, 72-2; Bonet Correa, 159).\nJuan de Arfe was the third in a line of renowned metalworkers originally hailing from Germany \u2013 following his grandfather, Enrique, and father, Antonio \u2013 and is known to have been active in Valladolid, Sevilla, and Madrid. His custodias (monstrances) at the Cathedral of Sevilla and Avila remain celebrated works of Renaissance goldsmithing in the classical mode, showing the influence of Donatello and Bramante, among others. \u201cArfe\u2019s last sculptural works of life-size human figures, such as the exquisite tomb monument for the Archbishop of Seville, Don Crist\u00f3bal de Rojas, reveal his development as a leading naturalist of the late Spanish Renaissance\u201d (Skaarup, 253; see principally Sanz, and Fajardo for Arfe\u2019s artistic activity). In addition to the Varia, Arfe published Quilatador de plata, oro y piedras (1572) and Descripci\u00f3n de la tra\u00e7a y ornato de la custodia de plata de la Sancta Yglesia de Sevilla (1587), both short tracts on metalwork.\nThe present copy, intriguingly, carries the apparent signature of Arphe himself on the bottom margin of the title page.

    "text": "It all started 3 months back when two of us, me and Saquib were chatting over our late night coffee destination about going somewhere far from Bangalore. And, this time the plan was to push our bikes to a 10 days plan and explore a state, if possible. Probable destinations that came to our mind were Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Argument started over coffee and we felt Rajasthan would be too far for us to ride from Bangalore and Maharashtra looks best during monsoon and hence we were left with Gujarat. This was something which each one of us wanted to do, especially visit the Rann of Kutch and I very well knew that this time we are going there for sure as the planning started in full swing. Although it was initially me and Saquib who kicked off with the planning and research, we decided to pull in some close pals of ours who might be interested for this long road trip. Sunil, Tapabrata, Ashish and Eshwari (who would be joining us from Gandhinagar) showed immense interest in our plan and we were more than happy with the group which formed now. We decided to start for the trip on 31st January, 2014 (Saturday) and come back to Bangalore by 11th February, 2014 (Wednesday).\nThe days crossed by and our excitement meter was becoming unstable day by day. We were meeting at times, just to check if everything was on track, ran through the route map again and again so that everyone knows the route very well. Unfortunately, Sunil could only be starting by the second half of Saturday and hence he targeted to join us directly at Gandhinagar.\nFew days before the ride started and we hit a major setback: Saquib had a situation in his office and his could not get the leaves approved. This came as a big blow to get us because he was the person who was the mastermind behind this mega plan and all of us wanted him to be part of our group.\nDay 1 started with me, Tapabrata and Ashish riding from Bangalore and our target was to halt at Pune. We decided to start around 4 am in the morning to avoid all the early morning traffic. Once you are on the road, you hardly get to know what time it is, and it always surprises you. This stretch being arrow straight road, you tend to fall asleep, especially when your tummy is full. With couple of breaks including breakfast, lunch, tea and most importantly, photo breaks, when we reached outskirts of Pune, around 8 pm in the evening and we started looking for lodges along the highway. After few searches, we ended up at a decent enough lodge with an adjoining restaurant where we decided to bunk for the night.\nTarget for Day 2 was to reach Gandhinagar as we had already booked a hotel and the group was supposed to rendezvous at the hotel. So, as planned, we got ready as soon as possible and got out on the highway by 4:45 am. It was chilly as usual and I was shivering with cold, but on the other hand, the roads were completely new for me as this was an unknown territory for me, so feeling cold was at the back of my mind and watching out on the road was always my priority. We crossed beautiful places like Lonavala, Khandala and with the rising sun at the back of a train of hills, the scenery looked beautiful which made us stop at multiple places for pictures. It was an eventful day, starting with 3 of us entering the Mumbai-Pune Expressway by mistake and ended up paying up fine to the cops, to having lip smacking vada pavs for breakfast to sudden increase in the traffic, especially of the tucks and trollers which kept on testing our patience all throughout the highway in Gujarat to getting stuck at the infamous Golden Bridge in Bharuch for 2 hours and last but not the least, falling prey on big potholes on SH 3 near Ahmedabad and losing my taillight. By the time we reached Gandhinagar, it was 10:30 pm and dead tired. Eshwari was waiting for us at the hotel and when enquired about whereabouts of Sunil, we came to know even he had issues with his bike near Mumbai and he could not proceed further as well. That was a moderate blow to our itinerary, but more importantly, we needed some rest.\nRise and Shine Day 3. We got the rest what we wanted, and I found a mechanic to fix my bike's taillight. So, after having breakfast from the hotel, we headed towards Sabarmati Ashram and Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, after which we headed towards Radhanpur. The initial plan of visiting Patan was dropped because of the delay of Sunil's arrival and instead, we decided to approach our next destination, the Little Rann of Kutch. Blissful tarmac all throughout, this is what we expected and heard about Gujarat and everyone of us were happy to ride on them. The more we approached Radhanpur, we noticed a change in the landscapes. We were no more surrounded by lush green fields, rather now we were able to see barren lands welcoming us from time to time, a notable decrease in vegetation. We crossed Radhanpur and headed towards Santalpur where we decided to bunk for the night. Constant touch with Sunil made us aware of him approaching Radhanpur for the night, so he can catch up with us the next day.\nIt was ought to be an exciting day, Day 4 it was. With the help of google location, Sunil met up with us at the guest house we stayed overnight and after sumptuous gujarati breakfast, all 5 of us headed towards Little Rann of Kutch. We approached a village after taking diversion from the NH and the moment we entered the village, there was chaos and obvious interest about us, where we coming from and all those stuff. It was like the entire village has come to greet us. Some older folks asked us where do we intend to go to which I asked about the little rann, they guided us to the right direction. We were already off the tarmac and the path was full with sand and we slowly made our way to the rann. And within few metres, we entered the little rann of kutch. A vast, barren land, with no trees, no water, hot and you could see the horizon all around you. It was an amazing feeling the moment I stepped into the rann. People started parking the bikes and start photo shoot, while I took some time to let the feeling settle down and finally pulled out my camera. Spending a good 1 hour at the little rann of kutch, we headed our way back to the guest house, it was time to check out and head towards Great Rann of Kutch! When we crossed the village of Lodrani, the Sun was getting ready to start its plunge towards the horizon and I started doubting whether we would be able to make it to Dholavira on time. Less I knew that I would encounter something magical on the way that would make us drop the plan of going to Dholavira and would make our day special. We got the first view of white rann few kms after we crossed Lodrani. So beautiful, magical feeling it was with cold rays from Sun over the horizon that we were spellbound with it and ended up stopping. No words can express that feeling and I was already having goose bumps seeing the beauty of nature. It took me quite some time to settle down, and believe that I am here, finally. We were so \"awwed\" by this place that we decided to stay there till the sun set. Mesmerized by the beauty of nature, we slowly started off from the place. We decided to drop the plan of visiting Dholavira because it was already dark and instead we headed towards Samkhiyali where we bunked for the night.\nWe started our Day 5 riding to Bhuj, our base for the next 2 days. It took little time for us to look for a decent accommodation and once we got freshened up, we headed for Kalo Dungar after lunch. We already had the permits prepared on our way though, which was a simple procedure. Kalo Dungar is the highest peak in the entire Kutch region and you get a spectacular view of the white rann from the top. We parked our bikes at one side and started walking towards the view point. Strong wind was gushing on our faces all along. The moment I saw the view of the rann, i seemed to me at the first moment if I am actually dreaming, or is it real! Ashish walked up to me at that very moment and said: \"Can you believe we came this far?\". I could not answer, it was the same feeling even I was having and what I wanted at that point of time was to simply enjoy the view. We continued from Kalo Dungar towards India Bridge in some moment's time. Road has been excellent all throughout the leg of the day and not even a single pothole was to be seen anywhere. We approached India Bridge around 4 pm, took some shots except the bridge (Photography of the India Bridge is prohibited by law), where Sunil went over to the jawans for some chat and in few moments, we made our way back, this time towards the White Rann. We did not want to try Dhordo which was already populated due to Rann Utsav and instead headed towards Jamkundaliya, where there was a BSF check post at the entry of the rann. A Bengali and a Kannada jawan stopped us from entering this restricted area and after few conversations and request, they did let us in the rann. The moment we left the check post, the tarmac vanished and red soiled road started. After few meters even that disappeared and we ended up in a dusty and sandy road. We held our breaths and in no time, we entered the white rann! We could indeed see lot of slush on both sides of the truck-tracks and although, it de motivated us a bit, because we expected a plain surface, but after few meters, all the slush disappeared and we were surrounding by white rann. Anywhere you see, we would see only the horizon with some hills at a distance. This is what we wished for! Everyone started yelling with joy, and roared their bikes on the plain surface of rann! Eshwari, who was on the thunderbird, was so excited that she pushed the accelerator hard and kept the throttle going, and we sped past few Kms. Amazing experience I must say, maybe this is the same experience which people gather at the Salt flats, Bonneville! Eventually she came to a halt trembling with sheer excitement! It was the moment where you feel that you riding all the way to Gujarat from Bangalore is success, all the tiredness vanishes the moment you are here. This was one of my best days yet, less would I be able to forget about the experience. We returned back to Bhuj for the night.\nDay 6 started off as a gloomy day, with Eshwari returning back to Bangalore. We had our bikes serviced at Bhuj and headed towards our next set of destinations, the Lakhpat and Narayan Sarovar. When we approached Lakhpat we could see desert all around us, on both sides of the road and a fort, standing tall in the middle of it. A road made of sand went through the fort with lot of diversions and I took one of them and started going towards one of the walls of the fort. I could see few faces peeping from few houses, eager to ask me about my whereabouts, but I ignored them and continued. After exploring some other lanes in the fort, I headed back to the fort entrance, continuing towards Narayan Sarovar. I must say that the place looked superbly beautiful and I experienced one of the best sunsets of my life here. There was a temple right at the edge of the sea (Koteshwar temple) and it was being maintained by the army. There was a checkpost right at the end of the pier and civilians are normally not allowed to go beyond that point. So, we parked our bikes at the very spot from where we could see the sunset. After good 2 hours spent at that very place, it was time for us to finally leave towards Bhuj.\nDestinations to be covered for Day 7 was Mandvi, before we head towards the another crown of Gujarat, The Gir. Main attractions of the day were the Wind Farm beach, dotted with windmills along the beach and the ship building yard. Both places were worth visiting and it was a delight for us to be there, after which we headed towards Morbi to shelter for the night.\nDay 8 seemed excited as he headed towards Junagadh, the gateway to Gir. We were welcomed by family of our friend who had made arrangements for our stay for the night in Gir at The Wilds Villa resort. The resort did not have any fencing and when inquired, we came to know that the day before, two lions had come over to that very place. Take that! And we were excited. The setup was splendid though with bonfire setup around 3 \"charpai\" where we lied down the moment we completed our dinner.\nWe were all excited to start the Day 9 early with the Gir Safari. However, due to lot of crowd at the ticket counter, we could not manage tickets for the early morning 6:30am one, but got the tickets for the 9:00am safari. As the Gypsy cruised through the jungle trail, we sighted deers, peacocks, langurs and a solitary Asiatic lion. It was not what we expected, but the guide told us that it need sheer amount of luck to sight lions in Gir and most of the safaris go back without even sighting a lion, to which we felt better. We left Gir and headed towards Vadodara, and honestly speaking each none of us were excited anymore, we did not want to leave this exciting and vibrant state and 10 days in this state was simply not sufficient, we felt that we needed at least 10 more days to explore more.\nDay 10 and we headed towards Pune where we were supposed to take shelter for the night. It was a boring ride all through to Bangalore on Day 11 when we finally reached home, exhausted and with a feeling \"We did It\".",

    "text": "Perhaps you make a good point there bizaro. My past experience in following FFH's investments has made me gun shy of doing that. These guys are in a different game and this could be a sound idea.\n1) Lundin is a much larger company (by market cap) than Yamana. They have more financial resources to fund the $250 million expansion projects at Chapada (throughout increase and Sucupira pit pushback).\n2) Lundin is a copper-focused company. Chapada is primarily a copper mine with significant gold credits. Lundin spends a lot of money aggressively exploring for copper at its properties. The Yamana copper reserves and resource growth will likely ramp up under Lundin's exploration team.\nThis is more or less the entire argument, if you ask me. Just can take a LOOOOONG time to play out given how long cycles last and how long it takes to get a mine from idea to production.\nBHP makes a strategic investment in Midland, way above current market price. C$5.9 million raised at 1.70 a share.\nBHP gets right of first offer on Mythril. If the drilling hits BHP wants the project because it is potentially a very large copper deposit (based upon the IP surveys).\nLundin conference call emphasizes that they have no capital constraints compared to Yamana. They plan to bring copper production forward in an aggressive manner. I expect the gold-only Suruca deposit to be shelved, while Chapada expansion timeline will be accelerated. Yamana had been slowplaying the major expansion spending to try to keep a cash flow positive profile for a few years.\nI can imagine the conservatives putting political pressure on the utilities to delay the coal power plant conversions a few years to save thousands of coal mine or coal power plant related jobs. Phaseout is inevitable but the exact timing is still up in the air, especially for the Genesee plants.\nWolfden Resources cutting timber for forest management has been kicking out revenue to Altius. Altius gets 20% of the sales receipts from timber sales. Altius received C$92,232 in timber revenue in 2018, and has received C$66,299 so far in 2019. See Wolfden\u2019s most recent MD&A. I believe these sales receipts become part of Altius\u2019s project generation revenue.\nThese regular sales are separate from what will eventually be a total sale of the Mt. Pickett timber rights (for at least US$5 million).\nBecause the total sale of timber rights didn\u2019t happen by November 2018 Altius can now, at any time, demand the return of what it paid for the Mt. Pickett royalty, C$7.663 million, in cash or shares of Wolfden.\nWolfden was a speculative royalty deal but Altius built some excellent protections into the deal.\nStrong Q1 performance and raised guidance. Potash is performing very well.\nAltius should be in striking range for C$90 million total revenue in 2019 (royalty and project generation revenue). This preliminary Q1 royalty number doesn\u2019t include ~C$300K from Voisey\u2019s Bay and PG revenue (timber sales etc). LIF must keep paying out and Chapada should have a big second half of the year with the improved recovery circuits installed this quarter. Maybe a couple hundred thousand extra revenue from Excelsior in Q4.\n90 million would be quite a reach. I will stick with 80 million for the year. Lundin buying Chapada, UCP win, highest quarter royalty revenue record, raised guidance and Altius barely moves. I think CapitalCities comment about the market not caring sums it up nicely.",

    "text": "Between Pride of the Clouds and Thunderclap Wyvern, I'd try and go all-in on the flying theme! Favorable Winds , Warden of Evos Isle and Esper Stormblade would all be useful additions to that end.\nThe decklist looks cool, some suggestions. If you are going to run Delver of Secrets Flip you are gonna need a lot more spells and scrying so that it can be flipped more consistantly (Also run 4 of Delver, and 4 Pteramander. Cut out Mistcloaked Herald). That also works well with Pteramander so you can adapt it a bit easier. The one thing that you REALLY should run is Remand , it is a great tempo play, and you also draw another card. Spell Pierce is great. Serum Visions for the scrying. A great budget option for blue is Nimble Obstructionist , since it is a flying threat with flash AND can counter any activated or triggerd ability you do not control. Depending on your budget you really cannot go wrong with Snapcaster Mage , since you can reuse any spell. Vendilion Clique is great for tempo, another threat in the air and lets you take an important card from your opponents hand it is great against combo decks. I would take out Favorable Winds since it is a bit slow and Pteramander , Tempest Djinn and Delver of Secrets Flip are great finishers, seems a bit redundant. Not so sure about the Unstable Mutation but i do se the appeal of it. These are just some suggestions and it kinda depends on what direction you want to take it in, your budget and if you want it to be competative. Hope this helps in any way.\n-2 summary judgment +2 Favorable Winds +1 though for running W/U without a Tbag in it.\nGood start. To pump your fliers use Favorable Winds . I would replace Curiosity for Curious Obsession if your budget permits. And maybe Jace's Phantasm as a cheap solution for graveyard decks. Good luck!",

    "text": "Unlike many of his peers, Crane is quick to let down his hair [not literally, of course].\nYou might know Ben Crane best from his YouTube videos, in which he speeds up his pace of play by donning Rollerblades and being towed by a golf cart; raps about barely qualifying for the FedEx Cup playoffs (\"I'm a bubble boy/buh-buh-bubble boy\"); and shares his mental-game secrets, Golf in the Kingdom\u2013style (\"I experience zone. I'm speaking to you from the now, in the middle of the now.\") Crane also croons with his fellow Golf Boys bandmates Rickie Fowler, Hunter Mahan and Bubba Watson (with lyrics by Mat Kearney, the singer-songwriter who, like Crane, hails from Oregon). But the 37-year-old funnyman also has an intense side. You've heard of the 10,000 hours it takes to master a pursuit? Crane has logged 35,000 hours honing his game. (He counted.) If you think that's odd, consider that Crane believes he's no more innately talented at golf than you are. The main reason he chose this career path was because as a kid he could beat his five buddies. The Tour's biggest ham talks about the 100 percent commitment required to excel at both golf and comedy, his infamously slow pace of play, and why he won't let the bad back that knocked him out of the 2013 FedEx Cup playoffs diminish his enthusiasm -- or his sense of humor.\nIn the media center after you won the 2010 Farmers Insurance Open, you broke into an impersonation of your southern-fried, former-college-football-coach agent Tommy Limbaugh. It got quite a laugh, even among the cynical press. Was that when you realized you could bring your act to a wider audience?\nIt's been a slow progression, no pun intended, where things have just worked. The more you show your personality, the more fun everyone else has. I'm watching tennis last night, I'm watching Rafael Nadal play a guy, and it was 6-0 in the first set, and in the second set the guy is just trying to score a point. He finally thought he scored one; they did the shot-spot thing, and it was out by an inch. It was the moment where he should have gone, like, What do I gotta do to score a point against this Nadal guy? But he didn't. Athletes get so stuck in competition sometimes that we just can't let go of it.\nHas your game improved since you've been expressing this lighter side?\nWell, 2010 and 2005 were my best years, but it's been a battle with my body. I have a lot more potential now, and I have a bigger team around me. Instead of no one following me, now I'll have friends who are following me, and sometimes they'll walk up to a random person and say, \"Who are you following?\" In a few cases the person has said, \"Ben Crane. He's my favorite player.\" And my friend will go, \"Why?\" And the kid will say, \"You don't know? You don't know about the videos?\" [Laughs] That is so fun right there.\nYour fans definitely get your sense of humor. When your caddie decided to take a day off on a Wednesday, and you told people to apply on Twitter for the one-day job to replace him, you got interesting responses, like, \"I have a rough tongue like a cat and can clean the grooves of a wedge in seconds. My tics are mostly silent.\"\n[Laughs] That deserves to be written somewhere in this magazine! That is so good. We've opened up the job twice, actually. We did it at the Byron Nelson and at the Travelers. For the Nelson, we found a guy who had played in college. It was his birthday. And for the Travelers, we did it for a cause called Charity: Water, and the guy bid a couple of thousand bucks. He was awesome. We really hit it off.\nDo you think most Tour pros could stand to loosen up?\nI don't think, I know. I mean, I'm very serious between the ropes at times, especially when it's not going well. I can feel like I can't let myself have a good time. But guys need to pick their chin up a little bit and look around. Dude, you're on the PGA Tour! You've probably dreamed about this since you were a kid. It's so fun. I don't care if you just made double; you have the opportunity to look at a kid and throw him a ball and make his day. I try to remember that.\nYou show full comedic commitment in your spoof videos, which you have to do to make them work. Your wardrobe gets laughs, too. Where did the helmet come from? In the video where you offer exercise tips, it's a crucial prop, along with the unitard.\nMy buddy went to Goodwill and found it. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" It's a low-end ski helmet. I never picked up on that until the fifth video. That whole outfit is like five bucks at Good-will. It's awful. It's so tight. It doesn't breathe. It would be great in the Oregon fall, for surfing.\nWho are your favorite comedians? Have you seen Borat?\nI have not seen Borat. Honestly, the stuff that Joel [Stock], my caddie, and I have seen -- he has a great sense of humor and a great memory for funny lines -- would be \"Coming to America,\" \"Spies Like Us,\" \"Caddyshack\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\"\nRight. Kind of like \"Life of Pi.\" At the end you go, \"Ah, now it makes sense.\"\nUnfortunately, \"Planes.\" It was a big letdown. \"Shrek\" was amazing. \"Cars\" was amazing. \"Planes\" was not. And \"Finding Nemo\" was great.\nYou have three kids, so it's obvious who's picking the movies. What TV shows do you watch?\nYou know, I'm trying to think if I've turned on the TV this year for something other than sports. I watched the Bible documentary. When you have three kids under 6, you have to ask, am I going to space out on the couch for an hour and a half, or am I going to hang out with my kids? When your kids are grown up and out of the house, everyone says, \"It happened so fast. I wish they were back.\"\nMusician Mat Kearney helped with the lyrics on Golf Boys 2.0 and the Bubble Boy video, which poked fun at you for being 125th on the money list at the Barclays. Which video took the longest to make?\nGolf Boys 2.0 was six weeks of talking to the production crew and doing some of the writing with Kearney, and giving feedback and stuff. The shoot only took two days, but afterward, editing and stuff, it was a couple of months. We shot it at Vaquero here in Dallas.\nDid everyone stay at your house?\nThey did, except for Hunter, who lives here. Bubba bought my daughter her first Elmo. He's awesome with kids. And Rickie was on the floor rolling around with them. It was funny; we were driving to the course and one of Kearney's songs came on the radio. I was sitting there thinking, What do you do when you're sitting right next to a guy whose song is on the radio? Do you sing along?\nDo you ever play money games with Ryan Palmer or Todd Hamilton or any of the other pros who live and play at Vaquero?\nI should, but it's really just practice. I like playing in the Phil money game, the Mickelson game on Tuesdays. It's competitive. I've played in that a few times, and you're so ready to play in the tournament after that.\nMickelson loves to get in guys' ears. Give us your best Phil smack-talking story.\nA few months back, Phil and I were playing a match in an off-week, and we were on the 10th green, both about eight feet away for birdie. He said, \"I found the secret to putting.\" And I said, \"Really?\" Well, I make my putt and he misses, and because he's always jabbing me, I say, \"Looks like I had the secret to putting on that one.\" He thinks about it for about 10 seconds and says, \"Yeah, but I had the secret to putting at the British Open.\" [Laughs] Yes, he did.\nYou rapped with Bubba Watson on the 16th tee during the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Were you more nervous for that or the golf?\nI was going to do it anyway. I had the helmet in the bag and everything. And then Bubba and I got paired together. I mean, are you kidding me? It was perfect. And there's a guy who stands up there and says, \"Hey, crowd, be quiet,\" and so we went over and grabbed his microphone. But, yeah, I was nervous.\nRory Sabbatini famously left you in the dust at the 2005 Booz Allen at Congressional. Have you gotten much faster with your pace of play since then?\nRory and I are friends, and I've tried to get better. Last year I talked to Jon Brendle, a Tour official, and they see everything. I said, \"Hey, how am I doing?\" His reaction was very positive. He said, \"Just keep up with the group in front of you.\" I don't want guys to get bummed out when they get paired with me. I didn't even know in high school and college golf that I was slow. No one ever said anything.\nYou beat Rory Mcllroy 8 and 7 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play in 2011, and later that year you made eight birdies in the last 11 holes to force a playoff with Webb Simpson in the McGladrey Classic, which you then won. Were you hotter when you thumped Rory or when you beat Webb?\nWhen I made those eight birdies, I got so hot with the putter. Webb told me he went back and watched the broadcast, like, six months later. He said, \"I got so mad. They were going in from across the green!\" With Rory, I was playing some of the best golf of my life, but my back went out the next morning on the range.\nYou finished the year 139th in driving distance. Was that because of your back?\nMy clubhead speed on the Nation-wide Tour was about 124 miles an hour. If I saw the front lip of a bunker 300 yards out, I wouldn't even think about it -- I'd just fly it. I was so long. I was No. 1 in driving distance for the first five months of the season out there, but then I got injured and stopped working on being fast, and now I'm way down in driving distance. [Laughs] I can't smoke it anymore.\nDid that inspire you to become a better short-game player?\nIt contributed to it. Plus, when you're not feeling well you can at least work on your chipping and putting, which I did. I would swing on a launch monitor and think about how I could get faster. I went from 115 mph to 124 mph in about a year.\nYou've worked with short-game coach James Sieckmann for a few years. How much of your short-game prowess do you owe to him? Why do you two click?\nI was having some trouble with my chipping and pitching, with my contact, especially on Bermuda grass with tight lies. I was like, \"I'm missing something.\" I spoke to Tom Pernice, who said, \"You should go see my guy.\" I said, \"You've got a guy?\" It's been dynamite. I think I'm top 10 in bunker play. He really understands the mental game, too.\nHave you also seen improvement in your wedge play?\nI'm much more confident with that 50-yard shot, the 60-yard shot, just because he's taught me proper technique and how to practice for that shot. The difference between the best player in the world and the guy who finishes 100th on the money list is not much -- maybe one shot a round.\nIt's a fine line out there. \"It's a fine line between clever and stupid.\" Do you know what that's from?\n\"This Is Spinal Tap.\" Have you seen that film?\nYou have to see \"Spinal Tap\"! For a comedy lover, it's an absolute must.\nOkay, it's on my list. I'll write it down.\nYou used to not look at the Tour pairings to see who you were playing with the next day, in case it was someone you grew up idolizing. Do you still not look?\nI still don't look. The Tour sends you your tee time for the next day, but it goes to my caddie's phone, it goes to my wife's phone, but not to my phone. Some guys will spoil the surprise and say, \"Looks like it's you and me tomorrow.\"\nYou learned the game at the age of 5 from your grandfather, right?\nYeah, my grandpa was like my best friend, and if I wanted to hang out with him we were going to play golf. The cool thing was, he had three old guys he played with, and one of his cronies died when I was 8 or 10, so I took his spot. We gambled a lot. We played a dime a hole, and double or nothing on 18, so it was big money. That was when I learned to love the game. That was at Portland Golf Club, which we live a block away from in the summer.\nAre you a member there?\nYeah, they gave me an honorary membership. They have a plaque saying that that's where I learned to play. There's a lot of history there. They had a Ryder Cup in . Hogan played there, and a lot of the greats, so they're like, \"Do you want us to put your plaque up?\" [Laughs] I'm like, \"No, no, in the ground is fine.\" So they put it in the ground next to the putting green.\nYou're a big tennis fan. What else did you play as a kid?\nI'd seen my dad going to work every day [he owned a small media-development firm] and I thought, That looks terrible. I've got to figure out professional sports. I played basketball until 10th grade, but I was vertically challenged and maybe the fourth-best player on my team. Soccer, I was the third-best guy on my team. Baseball, I'm kind of afraid of the ball. Golf, well, I was the best golfer of my five friends, so I decided to go for it. I quit everything else, practiced every day as hard as I could. The pro I worked with growing up used to say, \"I think if I worked a little harder I could've made it.\" I thought, I'll never say that.\nSo you got your 10,000 hours in.\nThirty-five thousand -- I added 'em up.\nSo you should be really good by now, given you've put in more than three times as much as the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell recommends in his book \"Outliers.\"\nI read \"Bounce\" [by Matthew Syed] and \"Talent is Overrated\" [by Geoff Colvin]. I think Bounce is the best one. He proved that guys like Mozart, Roger Federer -- it has nothing to do with genes; it's about putting in specific, intense hours of practice. Of course, you can't play post for the Houston Rockets if you're my size.\nSo you don't think you have any more innate ability at golf than a bogey golfer?\nNo. I think we all have unique gifts, but just about anyone can train to be just about anything.\nWell, that's both encouraging and discouraging. Four victories on Tour, two Web.com wins -- are you done? You're 37, and you've got a bad back. Is this it?\nNo. I'm planning to do the Steve Stricker thing. I'm planning to go to 47, and I'm planning to have the best decade of my career from 37 to 47. I am so confident that my best golf is in front of me -- and this is the shooter's mentality in basketball -- that I'm thinking of putting money down on myself in Vegas.",

    "text": "Happy Halloween: Smiley\u2019s Dog Costumes!\nOur first event came up unexpectedly, the Bridge and Tunnel Brewery was just a five minute walk from our apartment but we had no costume! I quickly cut out an avocado out of Dollar Tree cardboard paper and it was a success! Smiley won some toys and we got a growler for our fun last-minute costume.\nYou may have noticed the dog pictures on my Instagram, or read the two posts I wrote about our rescue Smiley \u2013 you may have even read the viral Dodo article about his rescue story! Our unexpected adoption (it only took two weeks of fostering to realize that Smiley belonged with us forever) changed all our plans. All those crazy Halloween parties we wanted to go to turned into us going to dog-friendly pub events, the dog parade and tonight we\u2019ll be going to the big NYC Halloween Parade with Smiley in tow.\nWe ended up going to another last minute event, the Tompkins Square dog parade, so Smiley wore his same avocadog costume and got outshined by popes and other crazy intricate creative costumes! It was a lot of fun and we\u2019re definitely going again next year with a better costume. Although most dogs wore hot dogs, delivery costumes and they rocked them, as a crafter I got inspired to do something a little more creative!\nTonight, the parade is mainly for people but Smiley will hopefully steal the show \u2013 as long as he actually wears the costume I made him and it doesn\u2019t fall apart. Stay tuned for photos of tonights shenanigans.\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 31, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags Avocadog, Halloween, Halloween parade, Halloween party, New York, Smiley, TompkinsLeave a comment on Happy Halloween: Smiley\u2019s Dog Costumes!\nTwo days ago we sent a $300 adoption fee to Pound Hounds Res-Q, the place that pulled Smiley from Brooklyn\u2019s high kill shelter, NYACC. We had originally planned on fostering Smiley, the cute 6 year old pit mix who was abandoned because his former owners got pregnant. We were in no position to get a dog \u2013 we don\u2019t make enough money and live in a small apartment, but we couldn\u2019t let Smiley die.\nWe ended up adopting Smiley after just two weeks of fostering, mostly because we fell in love with our foster boy and also because of Pound Hounds Res-Q. In addition to the fee, we also gave a small donation because of everything the rescue has done for us. Donating to rescues helps them save more dogs so I encourage everyone to do the same!\nThe amazing thing about fostering, is that it\u2019s practically free and saves lives! Shelters such as the NYACC become overcrowded and put animals on the kill list very quickly. They barely get a chance to get adopted! If you foster a dog, a rescue will cover the vet bills and any necessary training. Then you help the dog get decompressed, preferably crate trained and then you help them find a new forever home.\nFostering is a great way to help animals without making a lifetime commitment, that many people can\u2019t do. If we hadn\u2019t ended up adopting Smiley, we would have likely kept fostering, because it has been so rewarding. Let me tell you a bit about it!\nSmiley went from the NYACC to the vet to get neutered, then a special service was hired to bring him to us. We had never met him or even see him in real life! Smiley was friendly and curious but he wouldn\u2019t look up at me or make eye contact. He also didn\u2019t respond to commands, although we were told that he knew to sit, stay and come.\nWhen I brought him inside, he explored the place, sniffing every corner and demanding to know what was behind every door. It took over an hour to get him to slow down and rest on his doggy bed. He lay there for a while until I tried to put his harness on for a walk. He wouldn\u2019t let me put it on I\u2019m and bared his teeth, so I backed off and let him sleep. A few hours later, after my husband came home, he let us put the harness on without any fuss.\nOn his first walk with us, he pulled like crazy, giving us rope burn. He was so strong and wouldn\u2019t listen at all outside. We immediately ordered a front pulling harness, but got dragged around painfully for three whole days. We also watched some videos on how to get a dogs attention on walks and we tried to implement them, which only half worked.\nThe first evening while we watched TV, we saw him watching us from his bed. It was the first time he looked at us. Not surprising after being handed off from one person to another for ten days. He was scared and confused.\nWe crated him that first night as instructed by the rescue. People want to adopt crate trained dogs and we had to try our best although we didn\u2019t like the idea of him being in a small cage. He barked a bit but quickly went to sleep. The next morning he woke up wagging his tail at us, it was progress!\nThe second day he acted like a spoiled child, pushing his boundaries. He would jump on the sofa, demand treats and he pulled me even harder outside. I may have had one or two breakdowns that day because I couldn\u2019t connect with him. I couldn\u2019t see anyone adopting a dog that was this crazy and I also didn\u2019t know how long I could spend with him, but I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him like humans have in the past.\nThat night he barked more in his crate at night, and I was stressed knowing that we would have to leave him alone for up to six hours the next day. Everyone reassured me that he would be okay, as long as he wore a cone \u2013 he was recently neutered and could rip his stitches.\nWhen we came home after our trip, that we couldn\u2019t cancel although we had wanted to, we found his cone out of shape and he was practically hanging by it because a piece got stuck in his crate. It was around his neck so tight that he coughed when I cut it off. He seemed fine otherwise and extra friendly, but I was traumatized by the experience. I was too scared of putting him back in the crate while he had his cone, so we let him sleep in our bedroom on his bed.\nWhen he woke up that Sunday (we had gotten him in the afternoon on Thursday) he was a completely different dog. He was so calm at home, looked at us, asked us for pats and actually listened when we gave him commands. That day we took him to a beer festival because we didn\u2019t want to leave him home alone.\nWe had been told that he shouldn\u2019t be around other dogs or kids so we were extra careful. But he was calm around kids, accepting treats gently and he wagged his tail when he saw other dogs. We let him sniff a few and it seemed fine, we were starting to doubt everything that the kill shelter had said about him. We found a quiet spot at the chaotic festival and he sat with us, observing. People came over to meet him and he was so friendly and loving to everyone. No one believed that we had just rescued him.\nThe next day we had received a front clipping harness and the moment we put it on him, he stopped pulling on walks. He still got distracted outside but he was so much better at walking calmly. We let him sniff more dogs and discovered that he was super friendly but couldn\u2019t tell between dogs that wanted to play or fight.\nThe following week he started to feel at home. We let him sit with us on the couch but still kept him out of bed. He behaved better every day. Except the one time he jumped on the bed when I screamed because I saw a spider \u2013 but that\u2019s because I screamed and I assume that he was trying to protect me.\nDuring the week we also let him play with some dogs while leashed. He seemed to get along with everyone, ignoring the dogs who were aggressive and he backed away when an angry cat jumped out at him. He was clearly a good gentle boy!\nThat second weekend we had him, we took him to an amazing day care Petbuddy Services for a trial day. We were nervous to see how he would get a long with other dogs but it went really well! After a day of playing with dogs, he was even calmer on walks and less jumpy when he met new dogs.\nThe day he spent at doggy daycare we went out, but came home before picking Smiley up. Our home felt so empty without him even though he had only been there for ten days! That\u2019s when we decided that we\u2019d be keeping him. But we wanted to wait in case there were any issues with our landlord, although those were unlikely.\nOn Wednesday we took him to the vet again, and even though the rescue knew we were 99% likely to adopt him, Pound Hounds Res-Q paid his bill. Later that evening, we officially paid his adoption fee and he became a part of our family. The next day, I let him play off leash with a bunch of friendly dogs at the park and he did so well, people didn\u2019t believe me that he was a new rescue.\nSince getting Smiley there has been more stress in my life \u2013 we need to figure out where he will be while we\u2019re on holiday. We need to worry about him getting sick, hurting himself or feeling lonely when he\u2019s alone at home. I also have a companion at home now, a smiling face that makes me happier and I can\u2019t walk him down the street without him getting compliments left and right. Oh, he also gets me out of the house more and breathing that fresh New York air! I\u2019ve even met a few local dog owners that are quickly becoming friends.\nOf course I\u2019m already worrying about Smiley dying one day, but that\u2019s just how my brain works. He has already made my life so much better and more worthwhile. As much as I think that everyone should adopt a dog, or five, immediately, I understand that not everyone is int he position to do so.\nFoster! If you can\u2019t adopt. Donate to rescues, if you want to help but can\u2019t foster. Dogs, and animals in general, bring so much happiness and unconditional love to our hectic lives. They deserve our help and love, they should all feel safe and happy \u2013 the same way they make us feel. Please consider donating to Pound Hounds Res-Q today, without them we wouldn\u2019t have this beautiful dog as a part of our family!\nWe\u2019ve been to Tonsai twice now \u2013 once in December and the second time in July. December was hot, dry, lively and exciting! In July it was dead, everything was closed, the weather was miserable! Tonsai is a great place that\u2019s still pretty empty compared to Phi Phi Island and even neighboring beaches.\nWhile it\u2019s the perfect getaway during high (and dry) season, it\u2019s really not enjoyable during the low (monsoon) season. Unless you enjoy being one of 10 tourists on a hard to get to spot with only two available restaurants that mainly serve fried food. If you come any other time, you can enjoy a long tail boat ride to the beach, a choice of many restaurants, food vendors and bars, there are lots of people hanging out on the beach or at the hostels but there are also thieving mischievous monkeys!\nWe\u2019re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\nSmiley was pulled from the NYACC by Pound Hounds Res-Q. We are considering adopting him ourselves because he\u2019s such a good boy. The Dodo wrote about him a week ago with the hopes that his story will inspire others to adopt, foster and rescue dogs in need!\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 23, 2018 October 22, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags dog saved, foster, fostering, kill shelter, Pound Hounds, Pound Hounds Resq, rescue, rescue dog, SmileyLeave a comment on We\u2019re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\nThe second time we visited Thailand was the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away \u2013 but clearly not all of them.\nThe first time we visited Thailand was during the dry winter months when it\u2019s hot, overpopulated with tourists and low tied can ruin boat rides, kayaking and other water adventures. The second time we came in the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away \u2013 but clearly not all of them.\nA week before we arrived the famous case of football camp boys who were stuck in a flooded cave and a ferry had sunk, drowning many on board. We didn\u2019t know about this when we booked and it was quite scary to be there. We got lucky and the weather ended up clearing up, but all ferry and boat rides were rough, scary and puke-inducing.\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\nIt\u2019s prime mushroom picking season but it\u2019s quickly cooling down. You might be seeing mushrooms all around you, even in city parks and on the side of highways! There\u2019s still some time to go out and forage before winter chases us indoors for Netflix, hot chocolate and hibernation. However, most mushrooms take a lot of experience to identify which can be scary and discouraging.\nIt is also extremely dangerous to eat anything that you\u2019re not certain about. Although there are many YouTube videos and Facebook groups are not always a reliable way to be sure that you will be safe. Even after you read this article, go talk to experienced mushroom pickers, join a mycological society and always be overly careful.\nIt is not legal to pick mushrooms everywhere. Ask a police officer, park ranger or at the info center where you can pick them. If you go anywhere else, you risk getting a hefty fine. In NYC it can be up to $250!\nWild mushrooms are not like the ones you buy at the store. Some people might experience an allergy to a specific type even though they are not allergic to others. Some edible mushrooms have skins that certain people might react to with a stomach ache. Although I am lucky to be allergy free and tolerate everything I\u2019ve tried so far, I\u2019m aware that I might eat a perfectly good edible mushroom that might make me feel sick.\nLet\u2019s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The giant puffball (tiny ones are good too) is really easy to identify, grows to be huge so it\u2019s satisfying to find and it\u2019s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\nPuffballs come in round shapes and in various sizes. They don\u2019t have any gills, or stems, they grow right out of the ground. The regular kind is small, round, white/grayish/yellowish with tiny bumps and they get dark and dry when they are ready to release their spores. When they are dry, you can stomp on them and they will puff out dark-colored spores, which is why they are called puffballs.\nGiant puffballs don\u2019t taste any better than small ones, arguably they taste worse. But one big puffball can feed a family of three for a day. They can grow to be larger than your head! In their prime they are pure white on the outside and inside.\nIf they are any there color, or have any markings, be cautious.\nUnlike the hen-of-the-woods that I wrote about earlier this week, giant puffballs do have a very poisonous lookalike, but it\u2019s extremely easy to differentiate them! Once you pick a puffball, cut it down the middle from top to bottom, an edible puffball will have firm purely white firm flesh without any markings. It should look like sliced mozzarella!\nIf the mushroom is off-white, it\u2019s an edible kind that\u2019s past it\u2019s prime. Don\u2019t eat it! There are several stages of a puffball going bad. First, the inside will get yellower but will remain firm. Then it\u2019ll get wetter and darker, at this point the outside might be getting yellower too. Finally, it dries up and releases dark gray/black spores.\nEven when a puffball is yellow, it\u2019s technically not poisonous. The only type of puffball that is poisonous, is one with black lines that look like intricate designs. These will be on the outside and on the inside. These puffballs are very poisonous and should NOT be consumed.\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! Just make sure to cut every single mushroom in half, and throw any puffball that isn\u2019t pure white on the inside. The rule of thumb with mushrooms is, if there is any doubts, leave it behind.\nIf you thought that the hen-of-the-woods had many recipes, just wait until you bring home a haul of puffballs. You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\nAll you need to do is cut 3/4 inch slices, fry them in the oven or on the pan with some coconut oil and cinnamon and serve with maple syrup. If you cook them long enough you can barely taste the difference \u2013 they are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Delicious. Here are some other recipes.\nJust a quick reminder, some people don\u2019t react well to the skin of puffball mushrooms (or any mushroom skins). Some mushrooms have tough skin that\u2019s supposed to protect the mushroom from being eaten, this skin can be hard to digest and some people are more sensitive than others.\nIt\u2019s very similar to the skin on certain nuts, if you\u2019ve ever pooped out an intact almond, you know what I\u2019m talking about. Personally, I eat the skin but please be aware that you might have a reaction to it! You can always start by eating a small piece with the skin on, wait a few hours and see how you feel. It can be scary to feel sick after eating a wild mushroom and not know why.\nDo you have any stories to share about puffballs? What\u2019s your record find (size or amount)? What\u2019s your favorite recipe? Share your puffball stories with us in the comments below!\nI find these mushrooms the most rewarding to pick, because even a small one is enough as a side dish to any meal and the bigger ones can feed an entire family! Every time I\u2019ve looked for hens, I found at least one and usually had 2-4 kilos (4-9 pounds) in just 30 minutes of searching. Of course, you can also find a single mushroom that weighs 13+ kilos (30+ pounds).\nLet\u2019s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The hen-of-the-woods (maitake) doesn\u2019t have any poisonous look alikes, grows to be huge so it\u2019s satisfying to find and it\u2019s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\nThe hen-of-the-woods looks a little like the fluffy feathers of a hen, hence it\u2019s name. Here are some photos of how they can look at different stages of growth.\nDon\u2019t confuse the hen-of-the-woods with the chicken-of-the-woods. Chickens can grow higher up on the tree, they are orange and they grow in layers. I have heard a lot about these mushrooms and I\u2019m told they\u2019re delicious, however I haven\u2019t found any yet and I don\u2019t know how to tell them apart from the many other orange mushrooms that grow on trees! Stick with hens at the beginning, you can\u2019t go wrong with them and there are plenty to go around!\nHen-of-the-woods mushrooms typically grow on oak trees, so if you see acorns on the ground you\u2019re in the right spot. If you look at the roots of an oak, you\u2019ll notice that they have a clumpy shape with many little lumps which is very similar to the hen mushroom. From a distance, you might confuse a hen mushroom with some dried leaves. Always go check it out, and take a look around the entire tree. They tend to grow on bigger, wider oaks and there can be a several clusters of them around a single tree!\nHen-of-the-woods are either off-white, kind of beige/grayish or more brownish, especially around it\u2019s rounded edges. They always grow in clumps, so from a distance you could confuse them with clustered mushrooms \u2013 remember that even though it looks like a cluster, it\u2019s one big mushroom that spreads out and looks fluffy. If you cut it at the stem and you see many individual mushrooms, it\u2019s not a hen. If you see any gills (pictured below) it is NOT a hen.\nHens are smooth, fluffy looking, single-stemmed mushrooms.\nRemember, the picture above is NOT a hen-of-the-woods. It\u2019s an example of gills, that hens do NOT have.\nSometimes, the hen-of-the-woods grows on trees other than oaks. If you want to be extra safe, you can stick to only eating the ones that you find on oak trees, although like I already said, there isn\u2019t any dangerous look-a-like. Hens are very unique looking.\nDon\u2019t forget to bring some common sense with you to the forest. If there are too many bugs on the hen, if it looks dry or off-color, then it\u2019s probably not good for eating. While most insects are pretty safe to eat if cooked correctly, you should stay away from unintentional entomophagy. Plus, insects can cause allergic reactions in people who are also allergic to shellfish.\nAnother common sense move is to avoid picking mushrooms in forests where there\u2019s a mark on the tree, or a colorful rope tied around an area. These could mark a protected area, a sick tree, some sort of pest, pollution, disease, etc. If it looks questionable, don\u2019t go there.\nSame goes for roadside mushrooms. Think about the pollution that they are exposed to. Would you like some car exhaust with your mushrooms? I don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t pick anything that looks unclean (not including natural forest dirt) or could be polluted. Similarly to road exhaust, some places could be using pesticides or other chemicals in the area. Although most of us are already exposed to them from the food we buy in supermarkets, the less chemicals we consume, the better.\nWhen you find a hen and bring it home, watch a video on how to clean it correctly. It has many layers, the thick white stem isn\u2019t as yummy as the rest of it so you want to cut that off and if possible, clean it outside or in a large tub to avoid clogging your drain with forest debris. If you see any holes, cut into them and remove any insects, spiders or slugs.\nHow do you cook a hen?\nThere are so many ways to cook these mushrooms! Chop them into tiny pieces and stir fry, with other veggies, or if you\u2019re not vegetarian then maybe some meat, lard or eggs to make the perfect mushroomy omelette.\nThe nutritional value of hens varies depending on the website, but everyone agrees that they have very little fat or protein and lots of vitamin D. Some websites claim that they have very few carbs, others claim that they are 70% carbs. Almost everyone agrees that they are a healthy addition to a balanced diet!\nI tend to use too much olive oil and caramelized onions to make a fatty, crispy, scrumptious meal but there are much healthier alternatives. You can cook them in the oven with coconut oil, you can steam them, boil them, grill them probably even air fry them. Whatever you chose to do, make sure to cook them well as they can be a bit chewy and hard on the stomach if you undercook hens, although this is true for mushrooms in general. You can find various recipes here.\nIf you didn\u2019t manage to find any, or didn\u2019t want to risk picking the wrong mushroom, you can still enjoy eating wild hen-of-the-woods. Check out your local farmers markets from August until November and I guarantee that you\u2019ll find some hens \u2013 generally for $1 per pound!\nDo you enjoy picking mushrooms?

In school, instead of watching a caterpillar turn into a butterfly, people watch silkworms turn into moths!\nSoi Cowboy is the crazy street in Thailand known for strip clubs and prostitutes, but there are no ping-pong shows here! We visited the street just to people watch and it was quite a show. We saw women aggressively dragging single men into the clubs and offering all sorts of services.\nSoi Cowboy is the crazy street in Thailand known for strip clubs and prostitutes, but there are no ping-pong shows here!

    "text": "The day is drawing near when the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church will celebrate the fourth centenary of the union between the Bishops of the Metropolia of Kievan Rus' and the Apostolic See. The union was effected at the meeting of representatives of the Metropolia of Kiev with the Pope on 23 December 1595 and was solemnly proclaimed at Brest-Litovsk on the River Bug on 16 October 1596. Pope Clement VIII, in the Apostolic Constitution Magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis,1 announced the union to the whole Church and in the Apostolic Letter Benedictus sit Pastor2 he addressed the Bishops of the Metropolia, informing them that the union had taken place.\nThe Union of Brest opened a new page in the history of the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine.4 Today that Church wishes to sing with joy a hymn of thanksgiving and praise to the One who, once more, has brought it back from death to life, and it wishes to set forth with renewed enthusiasm on the path marked out by the Second Vatican Council.\nJoining the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in this thanksgiving and petition are the Greek Catholic Churches of the diaspora which date back to the Union of Brest, together with the other Eastern Catholic Churches and the entire Church.\nAs the Bishop of Rome, I too wish to unite myself to the Catholics of the Byzantine tradition in those lands. For many years, during my pastoral ministry in Poland, I sensed a physical as well as a spiritual closeness with that Church, which was then undergoing such difficult trials. After my election to the See of Peter, I considered it a pressing duty, following the example of my Predecessors, to speak out in defence of its right to exist and freely to profess its faith, at a time when both these rights were being denied. I now have the privilege of joyfully sharing in its celebration of these days of regained freedom.\n2. The celebrations commemorating the Union of Brest must be seen in the context of the Millennium of the Baptism of the Rus'. Seven years ago, in 1988, that event was celebrated with great solemnity. For the occasion I published two documents: the Apostolic Letter Euntes in mundum of 25 January 1988,5 for the whole Church, and the Message Magnum Baptismi donum, of 14 February of the same year,6 addressed to Ukrainian Catholics. It was an occasion for celebrating a moment of fundamental importance for the Christian and cultural identity of those peoples, a moment of unique significance, since at that time the Churches of the Byzantine tradition and the Church of Rome were still living in full communion.\nAfter the division which damaged the unity between the West and the Byzantine East, frequent and intense efforts were made to restore full communion. I wish to mention two particularly significant events: the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, and above all the Council of Florence in 1439, when protocols of union with the Eastern Churches were signed. Unfortunately, various causes prevented the promise and potential of those agreements from being realized.\nThe Bishops of the Metropolia of Kiev, in restoring communion with Rome, made explicit reference to the decisions of the Council of Florence, a Council which had numbered among its participants representatives from the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nIn this context, the figure of Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev stands out. As a faithful interpreter and defender of the decisions of that Council, he had to endure exile for his convictions.\nThe Bishops who promoted the union and the members of their Church retained a lively awareness of their original close ties to their Orthodox brethren, together with a full consciousness of the Oriental identity of their Metropolia, an identity which was also to be upheld after the union. In the history of the Catholic Church, it is a highly significant fact that this just desire was respected and that the act of union did not involve passing over to the Latin tradition, as some thought would happen. Their Church saw an acknowledgment of its right to be governed by its own hierarchy with a specific discipline and to maintain its Eastern liturgical and spiritual heritage.\n3. After the union, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church enjoyed a period in which its ecclesiastical structures flourished, with resulting benefits for religious life, the education of the clergy and the spiritual commitment of the faithful. With remarkable farsightedness, great importance was attached to education. Thanks to the valuable contribution of the Basilian Order and other Religious Congregations, there was a great growth in the study of the sacred sciences and the nation's culture. In the present century, a figure of extraordinary prestige, in this regard as well as in his witness of suffering borne for Christ, was Metropolitan Andrii Sheptyckyi, whose education and fine spiritual qualities were combined with outstanding organizational gifts. He founded schools and academies, supported theological studies and the human sciences, the press and sacred art, and sought to preserve historical memories.\nAnd yet, all this ecclesial vitality was continually marked by the tragedy of misunderstanding and opposition. An illustrious victim in this regard was the Archbishop of Polock and Vitebsk, Josaphat Kuntsevych, whose martyrdom merited the unfading crown of eternal glory. His body now lies in the Vatican Basilica, where it is continuously venerated with devotion and gratitude by Catholics from throughout the world.\nOutstanding among the heroic witnesses to the rights not only of the faith but also of human conscience in those difficult years is the figure of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj: his courage in enduring exile and prison for 18 years and his indomitable confidence in the resurrection of his Church make him one of the most powerful figures among the confessors of the faith in our time. Nor should his many companions in punishment be forgotten, particularly Bishops Hryhory Khomyshyn and Josaphat Kocylowskyj.\nThese tempestuous events shook the Church in the homeland to its roots. But Divine Providence had already begun to make it possible for many of its members to find a way of escape for themselves and their people. From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, great waves of emigrants began to cross the ocean, settling above all in Canada, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The Holy See took care to be close to them, by providing assistance and establishing pastoral structures for them in their new homes, including the establishment of their own Eparchies. At the time of trial, during the atheistic persecution in their native land, the voice of these believers could thus be raised, in full freedom, with strength and courage. In the international forum they defended the right of their persecuted brethren to religious freedom, and thus strengthened the Second Vatican Council's appeal for religious freedom,8 and the efforts made in this regard by the Holy See.\n4. The whole Catholic Community recalls with deep emotion the victims of such great suffering: the martyrs and confessors of the faith of the Church in Ukraine offer us a magnificent lesson in fidelity even at the price of life itself. And we, the favoured witnesses of their sacrifice, are aware that they helped to maintain the dignity of a world which seemed overwhelmed by atrocities. They knew the truth, and the truth set them free. Christians in Europe and throughout the world, pausing in prayer before the concentration camps and prisons, should be grateful for the light which they gave: it was the light of Christ, which they caused to shine in the darkness. For long years the darkness seemed in the eyes of the world to prevail, but it was not able to extinguish that light, which was the light of God and the light of man, wounded but not laid low.\nThis inheritance of suffering and glory today stands at a historic crossroads: now that the chains of imprisonment have been broken, the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine has begun again to breathe in freedom and to regain fully its own active role in the Church and in history. This task, difficult yet providential, today calls for particular reflection, that it may be carried out with wisdom and farsightedness.\n5. The celebration of the Union of Brest should be lived and interpreted in the light of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. This is perhaps the most important aspect for understanding the significance of the anniversary.\nIt is well known that the Second Vatican Council made a special point of studying the mystery of the Church, and that one of the most important documents which it produced was the Constitution Lumen gentium. Precisely because of this detailed study the Council takes on a particular ecumenical significance. This is confirmed by the Decree Unitatis redintegratio, which presents a very enlightened programme of activities to be carried out in the work for Christian unity. Thirty years after the conclusion of the Council, I wished to reiterate this programme with my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint, published on 25 May of this year.9 This Encyclical traces the ecumenical progress which has been made since the Second Vatican Council and, at the same time, looking to the third millennium of the Christian era, it seeks to open up new possibilities for the future.\nPutting the celebrations of the coming year in the context of a reflection on the Church, as proposed by the Council, I am anxious above all to encourage a deeper understanding of the proper role which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is called to play today in the ecumenical movement.\nTo promote dialogue with the Byzantine Orthodox Churches, there was set up, after the Second Vatican Council, a special Mixed Commission which also included among its members representatives of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\nIn various documents efforts have been made to arrive at a deeper and greater understanding between the Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches, efforts which have not been without positive results. In my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen11 and in my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint12 I have already written of the elements of sanctification and truth13 common to Eastern and Western Christianity, and of the desirable path to follow in the search for full communion between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches, in the light of the greater ecclesiological understanding brought about by the Second Vatican Council: \"Today we know that unity can be achieved through the love of God only if the Churches want it together, in full respect for the traditions of each and for necessary autonomy. We know that this can take place only on the basis of the love of Churches which feel increasingly called to manifest the one Church of Christ, born from one Baptism and from one Eucharist, and which want to be sisters\".14 The deepening of knowledge of the doctrine on the Church, brought about by the Council and continuing since the Council, has marked out what can be called a new path on the journey to unity: the path of the dialogue of truth nourished and sustained by the dialogue of charity (cf. Eph 4: 15).\n7. The shift from an underground existence has meant a radical change in the situation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church: this Church has found itself facing the grave problems of rebuilding the structures of which it had been completely deprived and, more generally, it has had to commit itself to rediscovering itself fully, not only from within, but also in relation to the other Churches.\nThanks be to God for having enabled it to celebrate this jubilee with religious freedom regained. Thanks be to God also for the growth of the dialogue of charity, whereby significant progress has been made on the road to the much desired reconciliation with the Orthodox Churches.\nNumerous migrations and deportations have redrawn the religious geography of those lands; many years of official State atheism have profoundly affected people's minds; there is still not enough clergy to respond to the immense needs of religious and moral reconstruction: these are some of the more dramatic challenges facing all of the Churches.\nIn the face of these difficulties a common witness of charity is required, in order that the proclamation of the Gospel may not be impeded. As I said in my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen, \"today we can co-operate in proclaiming the Kingdom or we can become the upholders of new divisions\".15 May the Lord guide our feet into the way of peace.\n8. In the new-found freedom we cannot forget the persecution and martyrdom which the Churches of that region, both Catholic and Orthodox, suffered in their own flesh. This is an important aspect for the Church of all times, as I recalled in my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente.16 It concerns a particularly significant heritage of the Churches of Europe, which remain profoundly marked by it: this needs to be studied in the light of the Word of God.\nRemembrance of the martyrs cannot be erased from the memory of the Church or of humanity: whether victims of the ideologies of the East or of the West, all of them are brought together in fellowship by the violence whereby hatred for the faith violated the dignity of the human person, created by God \"in his image and likeness\".\nPope John XXIII was fond of repeating: \"What unites us is much greater than what divides us\". I am convinced that this attitude can be a great benefit to all the Churches. More than 30 years have gone by since the Pope made this statement. In this period of time there have been many indications which suggest to us that Christians have made progress in this direction. Eloquent signs of this progress have been the fraternal meetings between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I, and those which I myself have had with the Ecumenical Patriarchs Dimitrios and, more recently, Bartholomaios, and with other venerable Patriarchs of the Churches of the East. All this, together with the many initiatives involving meetings and dialogue which are being promoted everywhere in the Church, encourages us to have hope: the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of unity, does not cease to work among Christians still separated from one another.\nAnd yet human weakness and sin continue to resist the Spirit of unity. Sometimes one even has the impression that there are forces ready to do almost anything in order to slow down, and even put an end to, the movement towards Christian unity. But we cannot give in: daily we must find the courage and strength, which at one and the same time are the gift of the Spirit and the result of human effort, to continue on the path already undertaken.\n10. In recalling the Union of Brest we must ask ourselves what this event means today. It was a union which concerned only a particular geographical region, but it is relevant for the entire field of ecumenism. The Eastern Catholic Churches can make a very important contribution to ecumenism. The Council's Decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum reminds us that \"the Eastern Churches in communion with the Apostolic See of Rome have a special role to play in promoting the unity of all Christians, particularly Easterners, according to the principles of this sacred Synod's Decree on Ecumenism: first of all by prayer, then by the example of their lives, by religious fidelity to ancient Eastern traditions, by greater mutual knowledge, by collaboration, and by a brotherly regard for objects and attitudes\".20 From this it follows that Eastern Catholics are to commit themselves to living profoundly what the Decree lays out. They are asked to make a confession of faith full of humility and gratitude to the Holy Spirit, who guides the Church towards the fulfilment promised her by the Redeemer of the world.\n11. Prayer will therefore be the fundamental element which should mark the celebration of this jubilee. Such prayer above all involves giving thanks for all that has been accomplished, down the centuries, by commitment to the Church's unity, and especially for the impulse given to the search for unity as a result of the Second Vatican Council.\nThis prayer is one of thanksgiving to the Lord, who guides the unfolding of history, for the situation of new-found religious freedom in which this jubilee is being celebrated. It is also an appeal to the Spirit-Paraclete, that he may cause to flourish everything which promotes unity, and may give courage and strength to all those who commit themselves, according to the guidelines of the Council's Decree Unitatis redintegratio, to this work blessed by God. It is a plea for the gift of brotherly love, and for the forgiveness of offences and injustices suffered in the course of history. It is a petition that the power of the living God will bring good even out of the cruel and many-faceted evil caused by acts of human malice. This prayer also expresses hope for the future of the ecumenical journey: the power of God is greater than all human weaknesses, whether old or new. If this jubilee of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, on the threshold of the third millennium, marks a step forward towards full Christian unity, this result will be first of all the work of the Holy Spirit.\n12. The jubilee celebrations should also be a time of reflection. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church must first of all ask itself what full communion with the Apostolic See meant for it in the past, and what it will mean for it in the future. In a spirit of humble thanksgiving, the Greek Catholic Church will give glory to God, for its heroic fidelity to the Successor of Peter and, under the action of the Holy Spirit, it will understand that today this same fidelity commits it to fostering the unity of all the Churches. This fidelity cost it sufferings and martyrdom in the past: this is a sacrifice offered to God in order to implore the hoped-for union.\n13. We cannot fail to entrust the yearning for full Christian unity to the Mother of Christ, she who is ever present in the work of the Lord and of his Church. Chapter Eight of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium points to her as the one who goes before us on our earthly pilgrimage of faith and is tenderly present to the Church which, at the end of the second millennium, is working to re-establish among all those who believe in Christ that unity which the Lord wills for them. Because she is the Mother of the one Christ, she is the Mother of unity. Since Mary, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gave birth to the Son of God, who received from her his human body, she ardently wills the visible unity of all believers who make up the Mystical Body of Christ. The veneration of Mary, which unites East and West so intimately, will serve, I am convinced, the cause of unity.\nThe Most Holy Virgin, already present everywhere in our midst both in so many sacred buildings and in the life of faith of so many families continuously speaks of unity, a unity for which she constantly intercedes. If today, in commemorating the Union of Brest, we recall the marvellous wealth of veneration that the Christian people of the Ukraine have offered to the Mother of God, we cannot but draw from this admiration for the history, spirituality and prayer of those peoples the consequences for unity which are so closely linked to those treasures.\nMary, who has inspired in their trials fathers and mothers, young people, the sick and the aged; Mary, the column of fire capable of guiding so many martyrs of the faith, is certainly at work in preparing the hoped-for union of all Christians: in the light of this, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church certainly has its own role to play.\nTo Mary the Church offers her thanks and asks her to make us share her concern for unity. With filial trust let us abandon ourselves to her, that we may be with her where God will be all in all.\nTo you, dear Brothers and Sisters, I impart my Apostolic Blessing.\nFrom the Vatican, on 12 November, Memorial of Saint Josaphat, in the year 1995, the eighteenth of my Pontificate.\n1) Cf.

    "text": "Gestational Diabetes Mellitus - Home Treatment.\nJust like any type of diabetes, gestational diabetes needs more than medicine to get it treated successfully. It needs you, for you are the person who determines the health of your pregnancy.\nYour registered dietitian, diabetes educator, your doctor and other members of your healthcare team can teach you about proper care for yourself and your baby so that both of you are protected from any complications that may arise. If you have all the necessary knowledge available on gestational diabetes, there can be no problem during and after your pregnancy. Once you know the effects of exercise and food on your blood glucose levels, you can avoid gestational diabetes complications.\nTesting your blood glucose level, regular exercise and changes in the time, amount and types of food you eat are important in gestational diabetes home treatment.\nChanging the type of food you eat, eating at regular times and the quantity consumed at each meal can ensure that your blood glucose level remain in a safe range. After your gestational diabetes diagnosis, a registered dietitian will help you to plan meals suitable for you. You may be required to keep a record of the foods you consume and your weight. Your dietitian will also show you how to carbohydrate counting so that you eat almost the same amount at each meal to reach a certain total at the end of each day.\nModerate exercise done regularly throughout the pregnancy improves the sensitivity of your body towards insulin and this helps blood glucose level control. Most of the time, eating the right foods and exercise are sufficient for gestational diabetes treatment. There should be a minimum of two and a half hours of moderate exercise each week. To accomplish this takes only 30 minutes of exercise each day for five days or more a week. You can even do 10 minute sessions so long as you get a total of 2\u00c2\u00bd hours each week.\nFor pregnant women who have been leading a sedentary life or have no regular exercise before pregnancy, they need to discuss with their doctor before any regular exercise. Suitable exercises for pregnant women are those that do not strain the lower part of the body. So, it is fine to exercise the arm muscles by using a machine known as the arm ergometer; or exercise the leg muscles by using a recumbent bike which has a chair-like seat that is suitable for women who are pregnant. There are also exercise classes especially for women who are pregnant. Walking and swimming are two low-impact exercises which are also suitable.\nIf it is possible for you to get your blood glucose to remain in the safe range through changes in your eating and exercise, it will not be necessary for you to take any diabetes medication. However, if you need insulin, keep ready with you some sugary food like 4 glucose tablets or some hard candy so that you can use them if you get low blood glucose symptoms such as confusion, blurred vision and sweating during exercise. If you believe your blood glucose level is too low, stop the activity, test your blood glucose level, and consume the sugary foods you have.\nDoing home blood glucose level testing is a necessary part of gestational diabetes treatment. You will need to do blood glucose checking at home at least once every day. It can be tough when you have to check your blood glucose frequently but from such testing, you will know you have no need to worry as your blood glucose level is in the safe range. Find out from your doctor how often you should check your blood glucose.\nDaily insulin injections may be necessary if your blood glucose level cannot be managed through exercising and the way you eat.\nDo not attempt to reduce weight during pregnancy if you were already overweight before the pregnancy. Find out from your doctor the possible weight increase during your pregnancy.\nYou may be taught by your doctor to count the number of kicks by your baby. You are required to notify your doctor if there is less than the usual number of kicks from the baby.\nYour blood glucose level can go lower than the safe range if you use insulin for your gestational diabetes. Although women with gestational diabetes seldom experience low blood glucose, you should know its symptoms and be prepared with sugary foods throughout the day.",

    "text": "Let\u2019s take a dive into some of the things we\u2019re working on behind the scenes!\nWe\u2019re looking at ways to make battling, building, and moving in Fortnite feel great on controller. We took an initial step with Builder Pro and feedback from you to create a better experience for console players swapping between building pieces.\nWe heard your feedback about Builder Pro feeling inconsistent. Sometimes after quickly switching to a building piece, it would not place when you pressed the button. Similarly, Turbo Building could force you to let go and re-press to start building again, making it unreliable. We\u2019ve fixed these issues, and Builder Pro should feel consistent.\nIn the v4.3 update we\u2019ve fixed various reported problems with the Turbo Building feature, such as building being cancelled while cycling through traps or after pressing certain combinations of buttons.\nWe\u2019ve also made Turbo Building faster so that gaps won\u2019t appear in your structures when aiming quickly. The first time you begin building it takes 0.15 seconds to build, but each piece after that is faster (0.05 seconds). Combined with Builder Pro, this gives you enough time to select a piece and rotate or edit it before placing.\nWhen playing with a controller and using Edit Mode to modify your buildings, aim assist will kick in and pull your crosshair toward the closest square. It will also try to confine your aim to the building piece you're editing. We've heard that some players find this feature uncomfortable to play with, so you'll be able to toggle Edit Mode Aim Assist off in the v4.3 update.\nLooking to the future, we want to provide for the best experience on console and that involves giving you the options to play however you wish. We\u2019re investigating giving you ways to bind actions to whichever buttons you would prefer to use. Additionally we\u2019re investigating other aspects like stick axis remapping. We\u2019re not sure when this will land, but we\u2019ll give you more info once its fully tested!\nWe\u2019ve been using LTMs to take existing aspects of the game and try new things with them (i.e. legendary loot in Solid Gold or faster games in Blitz). We look at LTMs as a space that allows us to explore different tweaks to the main game mode (e.g. Building Resources) and do things we wouldn\u2019t normally do in standard playlists.\nWe\u2019ve heard you about your love for 50v50 and we\u2019re currently evaluating keeping a larger squad mode live at all times for those who enjoy that type of battling more!\nWe took our first step into what a competitive playlist may look like with Solo Showdown. Creating a separate space for players who wanted to compete towards a prize while exploring how competitive play might look in Fortnite.\nWe introduced the Jetpack this week as our a Limited Time Item. Our goal is to introduce items that change gameplay in big & unique ways. We\u2019re going to keep a close eye on your feedback and the data we collect. You\u2019ll also see the Jetpack featured in our Close Encounter LTM going live tomorrow!\nThe Playground LTM will load you into the Battle Royale Map with some adjusted settings.\nBattle and build to your heart's content with an extended period of time to roam around the map as well as increased resource generation. All treasure chests and ammo crates will be spawned, try droppin\u2019 in different spots and scope out the loot. Friendly fire is on so you can scrimmage with your squad (up to 4 friends per match), but fear not you\u2019ll respawn immediately.\nOh \u2026 and Lloads of Llamas.\nThis represents our initial step into what a creative mode looks like in Fortnite. Practice, strategize and enjoy yourself. We can\u2019t wait to see what you do!\nWhen you hop on to play Fortnite after a long day at work or in classes we want that first match to feel as good as the last one. Performance is an aspect of the game that is very important to us and something we are committed to improving over time. Here are a few of the ways we\u2019re working to smooth out your daily play!\nIn the v4.1 update we issued a hotfix to address some long hitches, but we\u2019re still seeing reports of these hitches in our data. We\u2019ve added additional logging and diagnostics to help us track down issues that can cause the game to freeze. When you use in the in-game feedback report feature, it will allow us to diagnose these issues.\nWe know that many of the hitches happen because the game is stopping to load content at unexpected times in the middle of the match, instead of smoothly streaming the data in the background. The game will now be able to directly report these loading problems to our team. We've also added a new system to more reliably pre-load content before the match starts, so that new loading hitches don't sneak back into future updates.\nWe want to get you into a match in as short a time as possible after you hit play! We\u2019ve been working to improve file performance, ensure cosmetics are loaded in time, and reducing overall load times. By optimizing order of assets in our patches we reduced load times on console by 15-30 seconds in the v3.5 update. Each major release we regularly update the order of assets in order to keep load times down.\nWe recently boosted the server tick rates from 20 Hz to a solid 30 Hz in standard game modes. This means the server is updating the game 50% faster than before and should improve the responsiveness of your actions in the game. But we still have work to do. Fast and consistent server performance is extremely important to us, and we\u2019re still working hard at it.\nOur next goal is to ensure that \u201clarge team\u201d LTMs like 50v50 are hitting 30Hz for the entire match.\nFor large team modes we\u2019ve made optimizations to adapt and update players based on what they\u2019re doing in game. Players who are standing still don\u2019t need to update everyone around them very frequently compared to players who are running and gunning. Similarly, very distant players are updated less frequently, especially players that aren't visible to you. These optimizations allow our servers to handle larger numbers of players.\nCurrently the game throttles the frequency that your player's movement data is sent over the network to 20Hz for roughly the first half of the game. This is reduce strain on the server's physics system, allowing it to maintain frame rate. As the number of players participating in the match reduces to 24, we increase the frequency of updates to 33Hz. Over time we\u2019ll improve performance of server physics calculations, and we expect to be able to remove this throttling in a future update.\nWe\u2019re continuing to improve the core gameplay experience, and have a number of features in progress!\nStarting in v4.3 there will be in-match pop ups to highlight your challenge progress. Track what you\u2019ve completed and plan out your strategy for the remainder of the match or your next one!\nMarking positions on the map is a great way to communicate with your squad, but often the marker on the compass isn\u2019t enough to get you to your location. We\u2019re investigating ways to display an in-world marker to allow for easier navigation around the island.\nGetting a Victory Royale should be a memorable experience, and the victory screen should support that. We want to freshen up the celebration and make it a bit more rewarding.\nThe ability to zoom in on the map was added in a recent update, but the resolution of the image isn\u2019t quite as good as we want it to be. Our goal is to capture the world with as many details as possible to make it easier when figuring out where you're droppin\u2019!\nOur v4.2 update had some footstep audio improvements, where we added slightly more variation to above/below sounds. We recognize it\u2019s still difficult to identify enemy position in high-density locations (such as Tilted Towers) and we\u2019ll continue to iterate on this.\nAll outfits and cosmetics have value. We want to add ways for you to gain additional goodies through collection over time! This is work in progress - and it\u2019s a little further out.\nIn preparation for our Celebrity Pro-Am at E3 we've been hard at work making some improvements to the replay system.\nWe\u2019re developing new camera features that allow you to orbit around any point of your choosing as well having the camera automatically track the action for you by focusing on a group of players, rather than just one person.\nWe\u2019ve also been refining the map view in replays to add more functionality to the playerlist and to add bullet trajectories to the player markers on the map. Additionally, player nameplates have been tweaked to avoid overlapping where possible.\nFinally, we\u2019ve also been looking at improving player outlines and adding an x-ray view for when players enter buildings or actively building themselves so that you always have the best view of what\u2019s happening.\nWe're excited to get these new features and improvements into everyone's hands and will be releasing them as part of the game as soon as they are battle tested and ready! Keep an eye on our patch notes for all the details.",

    "text": "We all have read the tales told of Jesus in the Gospels, but few people really have a good idea of their context. Yet it is quite enlightening to examine them against the background of the time and place in which they were written, and my goal here is to help you do just that. There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and loons who would follow and praise them. Placed in this context, the gospels no longer seem to be so remarkable, and this leads us to an important fact: when the Gospels were written, skeptics and informed or critical minds were a small minority. Although the gullible, the credulous, and those ready to believe or exaggerate stories of the supernatural are still abundant today, they were much more common in antiquity, and taken far more seriously.\nIf the people of that time were so gullible or credulous or superstitious, then we have to be very cautious when assessing the reliability of witnesses of Jesus. As Thomas Jefferson believed when he composed his own version of the gospels, Jesus may have been an entirely different person than the Gospels tell us, since the supernatural and other facts about him, even some of his parables or moral sayings, could easily have been added or exaggerated by unreliable witnesses or storytellers. Thus, this essay is not about whether Jesus was real or how much of what we are told about him is true. It is not even about Jesus. Rather, this essay is a warning and a standard, by which we can assess how likely or easily what we are told about Jesus may be false or exaggerated, and how little we can trust anyone who claims to be a witness of what he said and did. For if all of these other stories below could be told and believed, even by Christians themselves, it follows that the Gospels, being of entirely the same kind, can all too easily be inaccurate, tainted by the gullibility, credulity, or fondness for the spectacular which characterized most people of the time.\nEven in Acts, we get an idea of just how gullible people could be. Surviving a snake bite was evidently enough for the inhabitants of Malta to believe that Paul himself was a god (28:6). And Paul and his comrade Barnabas had to go to some lengths to convince the Lycaonians of Lystra that they were not deities. For the locals immediately sought to sacrifice to them as manifestations of Hermes and Zeus, simply because a man with bad feet stood up (14:8-18). These stories show how ready people were to believe that gods can take on human form and walk among them, and that a simple show was sufficient to convince them that mere men were such divine beings. And this evidence is in the bible itself.\nBeyond the bible, the historian Josephus supplies some insights. Writing toward the end of the first century, himself an eye-witness of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D, he tells us that the region was filled with \"cheats and deceivers claiming divine inspiration\" (Jewish War, 2.259-60; Jewish Antiquities, 20.167), entrancing the masses and leading them like sheep, usually to their doom. The most successful of these \"tricksters\" appears to be \"the Egyptian\" who led a flock of 30,000 believers around Palestine (Jewish War, 2.261-2; Paul is mistaken for him by a Roman officer in Acts 21:38). This fellow even claimed he could topple the walls of Jerusalem with a single word (Jewish Antiquities, 20.170), yet it took a massacre at the hands of Roman troops to finally instill doubt in his followers.\nTwenty years later, a common weaver named Jonathan would attract a mob of the poor and needy, promising to show them many signs and portents (Jewish War, 7.437-8). Again, it took military intervention to disband the movement. Josephus also names a certain Theudas, another \"trickster\" who gathered an impressive following in Cyrene around 46 A.D., claiming he was a prophet and could part the river Jordan (Jewish Antiquities, 20.97). This could be the same Theudas mentioned in Acts 5:36. Stories like these also remind us of the faithful following that Simon was reported to have had in Acts 8:9-11, again showing how easy it was to make people believe you had \"the power of god\" at your disposal. Jesus was not unique in that respect.\nMiracles were also a dime a dozen in this era. The biographer Plutarch, a contemporary of Josephus, engages in a lengthy digression to prove that a statue of Tyche did not really speak in the early Republic (Life of Coriolanus 37.3). He claims it must have been a hallucination inspired by the deep religious faith of the onlookers, since there were, he says, too many reliable witnesses to dismiss the story as an invention (38.1-3). He even digresses further to explain why other miracles such as weeping or bleeding--even moaning--statues could be explained as natural phenomena, showing a modest but refreshing degree of skeptical reasoning that would make the Amazing Randi proud. What is notable is not that Plutarch proves himself to have some good sense, but that he felt it was necessary to make such an argument at all. Clearly, such miracles were still reported and believed in his own time. I find this to be a particularly interesting passage, since we have thousands of believers flocking to weeping and bleeding statues even today. Certainly the pagan gods must also exist if they could make their statues weep and bleed as well!\nMiraculous healings were also commonplace. Suetonius, another biographer writing a generation after Plutarch, reports that even the emperor Vespasian once cured the blind and lame (Life of Vespasian 7.13; this \"power\" being attributed to the god Serapis--incidentally the Egyptian counterpart to Asclepius; cf. also Tacitus, Histories 4.81). Likewise, statues with healing powers were common attractions for sick people of this era. Lucian mentions the famous healing powers of a statue of Polydamas, an athlete, at Olympia, as well as the statue of Theagenes at Thasos (Council of the Gods 12). Both are again mentioned by Pausanias, in his \"tour guide\" of the Roman world (6.5.4-9, 11.2-9). Lucian also mentions the curative powers of the statue of a certain General Pellichos (Philopseudes 18-20). And Athenagoras, in his Legatio pro Christianis (26), polemicizes against the commonplace belief in the healing powers of statues, mentioning, in addition to the statue of a certain Neryllinus, the statues of Proteus and Alexander, the same two men I discuss in detail below.\nBut above all these, the \"pagans\" had Asclepius, their own healing savior, centuries before, and after, the ministry of Christ. Surviving testimonies to his influence and healing power throughout the classical age are common enough to fill a two-volume book (Edelstein and Edelstein, Asclepius: A Collection and Interpretation of the Testimonies, in two volumes, 1945--entries 423-450 contain the most vivid testimonials). Of greatest interest are the inscriptions set up for those healed at his temples. These give us almost first hand testimony, more reliable evidence than anything we have for the miracles of Jesus, of the blind, the lame, the mute, even the victims of kidney stones, paralytics, and one fellow with a spearhead stuck in his jaw (see the work cited above, p. 232), all being cured by this pagan \"savior.\" And this testimony goes on for centuries. Inscriptions span from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. and later, all over the Roman Empire. Clearly, the people of this time were quite ready to believe such tales. They were not remarkable tales at all.\nThis more general evidence of credulity in the Roman Empire shows the prevalence of belief in divine miracle working of all kinds. I will now present you with three historical individuals who truly flesh out the picture.\nApollonius, Peregrinus, and Alexander are three rather interesting religious founders about whom we know even more than we do of Jesus. The first, Apollonius of Tyana, is often called the \"pagan Christ,\" since he also lived during the first century, and performed a similar ministry of miracle-working, preaching his own brand of ascetic Pythagoreanism--he was also viewed as the son of a god, resurrected the dead, ascended to heaven, performed various miracles, and criticized the authorities with pithy wisdom much like Jesus did.\nNaturally, his story is one that no doubt grew into more and more fantastic legends over time, until he becomes an even more impressive miracle-worker than Jesus in the largest surviving work on him, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written by Philostratus around 220 A.D. This work is available today in two volumes as part of the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, a set that also includes the surviving fragments of Apollonius' own writings (if only Jesus had bothered to write something!) as well as the Treatise against him by the Christian historian Eusebius. There were other books written about him immediately after his death, but none survive.\nEven Eusebius, in his Treatise against Apollonius, does not question his existence, or the reality of many of his miracles--rather, he usually tries to attribute them to trickery or demons. This shows the credulity of the times, even among educated defenders of the Christian faith, but it also shows how easy it was to deceive. Since they readily believed in demons and magical powers, it should not surprise us that they believed in resurrections and transmutations of water to wine.\nWe also know that the cult that grew up around Apollonius survived for many centuries after his death. An inscription from as late as the 3rd century names him as a sort of pagan \"absolver of sins,\" sent from heaven (Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed., 1996). The emperor Caracalla erected a shrine to him in Tyana around 215 A.D (Dio Cassius, 78.18; for a miraculous display of clairvoyance on the part of Apollonius, see 67.18). According to one account, the ghost of Apollonius even appeared to the emperor Aurelian to convince him to stop his siege of Tyana, whereupon he also erected a shrine to him around 274 A.D. (Historia Augusta: Vita Aureliani 24.2-6).\nLater Arabic sources even discuss the fame and potency of certain relics associated with him, which remained in use well into the sixth and seventh centuries, the last of them apparently destroyed by crusaders in 1204 A.D. So popular was the belief in the power of these \"talismans\" that the Church was forced to accept their use, even while condemning Apollonius and his shrines as demonic (see sources below). And so, we see here an independent confirmation that blind belief in the divine status and miraculous powers of mere mortals easily captivated the people of this time, a fact that even modern Christians must admit.\nAn even more colorful story is that of a crazy fellow called Peregrinus, nicknamed \"Proteus,\" who set himself on fire during the Olympic games in 165 A.D. to prove his faith in reincarnation. The notion of suicide as a proof of such faith was not new. Indian Brahmans had immolated themselves before Western audiences on several occasions before, the most famous being Calanus, at Susa, in front of Alexander the Great, and Zarmarus, at Athens, in front of Augustus (Plutarch, Alexander 69.8). What is most relevant, however, is the fascinating story told about him by the skeptic Lucian in his satirical work, \"The Death of Peregrinus.\" Lucian knew Proteus personally, and he gives us a look at what the story of Jesus might have been had a skeptic been around to give us a different account.\nWhile Aulus Gellius had also met this man in Athens, and was impressed enough to call him a man of \"dignity and fortitude\" (Attic Nights 11.1-7), Lucian had another point of view. He describes the vainglorious motivations of Proteus, and the duped mobs clamoring for a miracle. He also mentions the gullibility of Christians, who, he says, were easily duped by scam artists (13). Indeed, after the death of Peregrinus, people reported that he was, like Jesus, risen from the dead, wearing white raiment, and that he ascended to heaven in the form of a vulture (40). The punch line is that this latter story may have been a deliberate invention of Lucian himself (39), told to gullible followers, and later recounted to him as if it were fact, showing the effects of the rumor mill at work. Indeed, even people who were in the same city at the time were ready to believe that an earthquake accompanied his death, reminding us of the absurd miracles surrounding the death of Jesus recounted without a blush in Matthew 27:51-54. How easy it was for such stories to be believed! Even if this tale is filled with rhetoric on the part of Lucian, his criticism of gullibility would have no weight if it did not ring true.\nPeregrinus also had a small cult following after his death. His staff was treated as a religious relic (Lucian, The Ignorant Book Collector 14), his disciples preached his doctrine (Lucian, Runaways), and his statue healed the sick and gave oracles (Athenagoras, cited above). But his bid for religious glory was not as successful as another man, Alexander of Abonuteichos. Lucian dedicates an even longer and more vicious account of his personal contacts with this man, whom he calls \"the quack prophet.\" The account alone is detailed and entertaining, but for our present purpose it illustrates how easy it was to invent a god and watch the masses scurry to worship it. His scam began around 150 A.D. and lasted well beyond his death in 170 A.D., drawing the patronage of emperors and provincial governors as well as the commons. His cult may have even lasted into the 4th century, although the evidence is unclear.\nThe official story was that a snake-god with a human head was born as an incarnation of Asclepius, and Alexander was his keeper and intermediary. With this arrangement Alexander gave oracles, offered intercessory prayers, and even began his own mystery religion. Lucian tells us the inside story. Glycon was in fact a trained snake with a puppet head, and all the miracles surrounding him were either tall tales or the ingenious tricks of Alexander himself. But what might we think had there been no Lucian to tell us this? So credulous was the public as well as the government, that a petition to change the name of the town where the god lived, and to strike a special coin in his honor (Lucian, Alexander 58), was heeded, and we have direct confirmation of both facts: such coins have been found, dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius and continuing up into the 3rd century, bearing the unique image of a human-headed snake god. Likewise, the town of Abonuteichos was petitioned to be renamed Ionopolis, and the town is today known as Ineboli, a clear derivation. Even statues, inscriptions, and other carvings survive, attesting to this Alexander and his god Glycon and their ensuing cult (Culture and Society in Lucian, pp. 138, 143).\nAs for his influence, Lucian tells us that Severianus, the governor of Cappadocia, was killed in Armenia because he believed an oracle of Alexander's (27), and Rutilianus, the governor of Moesia and Asia, was also a devout follower, and even married Alexander's daughter. Indeed, Alexander's \"god\" was so popular that people rushed all the way from Rome to consult him (30), and even the emperor Marcus Aurelius sought his prophecy (48). From this it is all the more apparent that religious crazes were a dime a dozen in the time and place of the Gospels, helping to explain why a new and strange religion like Christianity could become so popular, and its claims--which to us sound absurd--could be so readily believed.\nThe final lesson from the case of Alexander and Peregrinus is that Lucian's skeptical debunking never persuaded any believers, showing that even the rare skeptic, no matter how convincing his arguments and evidence, could have no practical effect on the credulous. The vast majority would never read or hear anything he wrote, and most of those who did would dismiss it. Indeed, believers were hostile to critical thought and would shout the skeptics down and drive off even suspected doubters in their midst, as actually happened in the case of Alexander: before every ceremony, the congregation would cry \"Away with the Epicureans! Away with the Christians!\" (and atheists and unbelievers in general: 38) since these two groups had a reputation for trying to debunk popular religion (this hostility could even come to slander and violence: 25). In effect, this was like clamping their hands over their ears and humming, deliberately refusing even to hear reasonable arguments, much less to consider their force.\nFrom all of this one thing should be apparent: the age of Jesus was not an age of critical reflection and remarkable religious acumen. It was an era filled with con artists, gullible believers, martyrs without a cause, and reputed miracles of every variety. In light of this picture, the tales of the Gospels do not seem very remarkable. Even if they were false in every detail, there is no evidence that they would have been disbelieved or rejected as absurd by many people, who at the time had little in the way of education or critical thinking skills. They had no newspapers, telephones, photographs, or public documents to consult to check a story. If they were not a witness, all they had was a man's word. And even if they were a witness, the tales above tell us that even then their skills of critical reflection were lacking. Certainly, this age did not lack keen and educated skeptics--it is not that there were no skilled and skeptical observers. There were. Rather, the shouts of the credulous rabble overpowered their voice and seized the world from them, boldly leading them all into the darkness of a thousand years of chaos. Perhaps we should not repeat the same mistake. After all, the wise learn from history. The fool ignores it.\nGlenn Miller has written a rebuttal to this essay (\"Were the Miracles of Jesus invented by the Disciples/Evangelists?\" 2002), in response to which I changed some of the language above so as not to give a mistaken impression of my meaning. Miller's title has little to do with my essay, since I am not arguing here (even if I do elsewhere) that anyone in particular \"invented\" the miracles of Jesus. Rather, I am merely presenting a survey of the social and intellectual context in which those miracles came to be believed.\nAs to the remainder of Miller's criticism of this essay specifically, I plan to respond in a future rebuttal (which will be announced here). But one simple point must be made even now: almost all of Miller's relevant evidence comes from the educated or even scholarly elite (like Lucian), and thus in no way represents the average man or woman in antiquity, who by their very circumstance wrote nothing for Miller to examine. I would guess that skilled skeptics and skeptical viewpoints like those Miller finds probably could not be found in much more than 10% of the population of the time, if even that--but whose existence I acknowledged even in the original draft of this essay.\nThe fact that pagan miracle working is not much heard of today is in large part due to the more effective Christian propaganda during the Empire and, of course, a thousand years of censorship afterward. An excellent discussion of the former, and how it contributed to the eventual success of the Church, is given by Thomas Matthews in The Clash of the Gods: A Reinterpretation of Christian Art (1993). For a broad comparative study of holy men of all faiths (Christian, pagan, and Jewish) in the time of Jesus, an excellent source is Sage, Saint, and Sophist: Holy Men and their Associates in the Early Roman Empire, by Graham Anderson (1994). Both are highly recommended.\nThe most extensive study on the historicity of Apollonius as well as his cult and legend can be found in the otherwise dry work by Maria Dzielska, Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, translated by Piotr Pienkowski (L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1986). Interested scholars should begin there. In particular, the source tradition on his magic \"talismans\" is a complicated affair, but their history and reluctant acceptance by the Church is discussed at great length by Dzielska in chapter 3. As for Lucian, his works about Peregrinus and Alexander are available in a very readable and engaging English translation in Lionel Casson's Selected Satires of Lucian (1962). These two stories are a very fun read, and well worth seeking out. An excellent survey and analysis of Lucian's works and his surrounding culture is available in Culture and Society in Lucian by C. P. Jones (1986). This is, in fact, a must-read for anyone interested in the contrast between free thought and gullibility in the Roman Empire. It has entire chapters dedicated to Peregrinus and Alexander. Finally, Lucian's Philopseudes (or \"Lover of Lies\") is a virtual treasure trove of examples of ancient credulity and superstition that is a must-read source on the subject (it can be found in vol. 3 of Lucian's works in the Loeb Classical Library).",

    "text": "This DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation) and after correction for difference in exposure conditions and between respiratory rates under standard conditions and under conditions of light activity (1/0.38 m3/kg x 7d/5d x 6.7 m3/10 m3).\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal) and after correction for difference in absorption and in exposure conditions (50%/5% x 7d/5d). The oral and dermal absorptions are estimated to be 50 and 5% respectively.\nOccupational exposure limits (8-h time weighted average) of 10 ppm (49 mg/m3) have been adopted in Austria and Germany (DFG) or of 25 ppm (125 mg/m3) in Belgium, Denmark and Great Britain. Short-term OEL of 10 ppm is in force in Austria, of 20 ppm in Germany (DFG) and of 25 ppm in Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden and UK.\n\u201cCarcinogenicity studies with hexylene glycol are not available. However, the genotoxicity studies provide no evidence of a carcinogenic potential. In animal studies of limited validity, 40 mg/kg body weight and day was found to be the NOEL for systemic toxicity after oral administration of the substance. The critical effect of hexylene glycol, however, is the eye irritation, which was observed in animals treated with the undiluted substance. Hexylene glycol does not seem to be a very powerful eye irritant as 25 % solutions were not irritating. In an early study, eye irritation developed in most of the 12 male and female test persons exposed for 15 minutes to hexylene glycol vapour in a concentration of 50 ppm (approximately equivalent to the saturation concentration at 25\u00b0C). No NOEL was determined in this study. The eye irritation seems not to have been very severe, a fact which is also suggested by the steepness of the dose-response curve seen in the Draize test data. The MAK value was established provisionally at 10 ml/m3. Because the eye irritation was not severe, for the restriction of exposure peaks hexylene glycol was classified in Peak limitation category I with an excursion factor of 2. Then, even during the permissible peak concentrations up to 20 ml/m3, no marked irritation is expected. Because of the lack of adequate data for the irritant potential of hexylene glycol, the MAK value must be considered provisional and requires confirmation in further studies. Assuming that 100 % of the inhaled substance is absorbed, exposure to concentrations in the range of the MAK value could result in a daily dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight which is still below the NOEL determined in animal studies with oral administration, assuming 100 % absorption here too. As there are no reproductive toxicity studies, hexylene glycol is listed in Section II of the List of MAK and BAT Values. The sensitizing potential is low and so the substance is not designated with an \"Sh\". The solubility of the substance suggests that it would be readily absorbed through the skin, but as the toxicity after repeated dermal application to experimental animals is low, the substance is not designated with an \"H\"\u201d.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-inhalation x 1/1.15 m3/kg). The absorption by inhalation is expected to be of the same order than the absorption by oral route.\nThis DNEL was derived using the NOAEL of 450 mg/kg/day from a 90-day oral toxicity study in rats conducted according to OECD test guideline 408 by oral route (Fabreguettes, 1999a), after a route to route extrapolation (oral-to-dermal, x 50%/5%).

    "text": "1) The development of screw conveyor can be divided into two process, shaft type auger conveyor and shaftless type auger conveyor.\na. Shaft type auger conveyor consists of screw, U type trough, cover plate, inlet, outlet and drive device, which has three types of installation mode, horizontal, inclined and vertical mounting.\nb. Shaftless type auger conveyor uses shaftless spiral blade to replace screw, and U type trough is equipped with replaceable lining. The structure of shaftless type auger conveyor is simple, the material is fed into inlet and moving towards outlet by spiral blades. The whole conveying process is made in a fully closed trough.\n2) GX type auger conveyor is appeared in early phase of screw conveyor and is the earliest universal equipment in China. It mainly transports powdery, granular and small lumpy material, and is not suitable to convey perishable, viscous, easily caked and large chunks of material, because these material are easy to bond on the spiral blades, or block at the position of hanger bearing, which will cause inconvenience to the transportation process. The advantages of GX screw conveyor are energy-saving, low consumption, dust prevention, good sealing, low noise, well-adapted, easy operation and maintenance, flexible arrangement of the positions of inlet and outlet. The disadvantages are huge power consumption, quick wearing of conveyor parts, serious material crushing in the transportation process.\n3) LS type auger conveyor is new generation of screw conveyor, which is designed and improved on the basis of GX type auger conveyor. The advantages are novel structure, reliable performance, advanced technology, wide range of application, significant energy saving and consumption reducing.\n1) Large capacity, high speed and long service life.\n2) Low energy consumption. Most of the energy for screw conveyor is spent on abrasion.\n3) Intelligent development. The future auger conveyor should be closely connected with computer. It will be suitable for program control and intelligent operation. The material handling, equipment installation and maintenance should be intelligent management.\n4) Screw conveyor can be curved transportation.\n5) Combined, compound and large-scale transportation mode. Screw conveyors are co-used with various kinds of continuous conveying equipments to finish complicated material handling. Large-scale transportation includes large capacity, the length of single conveyor and high angle conveying, etc.\n6) To expand the scope of application. At present, the usage range of auger conveyor is restricted. The scope of application should be expanded, to design the auger conveyors that can be operated in corrosive, radioactive, flammable material environment in the condition of high and low temperatures, as well as the conveyors which can transport molten, explosive, easily coking and viscous materials.\n7) To design auger conveyor using environmental awareness, and reduce the pollution to achieve the goal of green design.\nPK Machinery is a professional manufacturer of vibrating screen, screw conveyor, belt conveyor, bucket elevator and scraper conveyor, further information, please click:www.pkmachinery.com.",

The Hallmark cards are a great way to show care and love. My youngest loves the ladybug case and thinks the note cards are sweet! And my husband recorded the book and my youngest loves it!\nWith backpacks full of new pencils, binders and glue, kids might think they\u2019re ready to take on the first day of school. But, sometimes kids need more than school supplies to face the exciting and challenging situations the upcoming year holds. That\u2019s why Hallmark has created a back-to-school confidence checklist!\nLet them hold onto your words. Kids often get embarrassed when parents say \u201cI love you\u201d in front of their friends. Think about sticking a card in their backpack or inside a textbook, so they can find it later and hold onto it all day.\nSurprise your child with a lunchtime delight. Fruits and veggies will help a kid be physically fit, but don\u2019t forget about a child\u2019s emotional wellness. The unexpected \u201cI love you\u201d or \u201cgood luck\u201d will let your child know you\u2019re by their side, even after they get on the school bus.\nPass the encouragement bug around your family. Challenge the entire family to support each other by passing around the encouragement bug \u2014 Hallmark\u2019s Bug \u2018Em. One person starts by filling Bug \u2018Em with treats, a coupon to do something nice (e.g., make their sibling\u2019s bed) or a kind note of encouragement, and then leaves Bug \u2018Em where the recipient will find it. Once the recipient finds Bug \u2018Em, he or she is charged with surprising another family member and spreading the encouragement bug.\nWe have done the homework for you and want to give you a jumpstart on the school year.\n*BONUS* Hallmark Recordable Storybook - Recordable Storybooks allow you to record your voice, and your little ones can read along with you even if you\u2019re far away. They are also great for encouraging your kids to read and building confidence for reading aloud!\nPrint your Quiznos coupons before they are gone!\nDecoding Coupon Barcodes - Is It Wrong?\nI was shopping in Harris Teeter yesterday and ran into an interesting situation. Because I am often recognized at the stores, people always ask me questions. I am more than happy to help. However, when I have to tell someone their doing something \"Wrong\" I feel bad. I had to deal with that yesterday.\nFirst of all, I was asked if there was a way to read the coupon bar code to see if they can use it on other products than what it was intended for. I answered \"No, I don't teach that practice\". Then I was informed that a customer in the store told them about it and was doing it regularly. I was a little upset about this. Practices like that is the reason stores are tightening up their coupon policies and making it harder for us to get great deals.\nSimply put, it is deciphering the bar code on a coupon to see if it will work on different (preferably less expensive) items.\nLook at coupon barcode decoding this way: It is like using counterfeit money to pay for your purchase! Although the cashier may not notice you are paying with a counterfeit bill, it will eventually reveal itself and the store looses out. A coupon is a form of payment and by not getting what the coupon says it is for is the same as paying with counterfeit money.\nSo, please read your coupons, get exactly what it says it is for and follow the parameters given by the coupon. Please don't use the barcode to determine what you can get because you know the register won't beep. Just because the register does not beep, does not mean that it is OK.\nThere are plenty of other websites and blogs that teach this practice and believe that it is OK. Please Be Aware! They believe they are right and have no problem teaching others to do the same. Taking advantage of a glitch in the bar code to get around the text of the coupon is fraud.",

Also, we only celebrate one wedding per day, so all our locations can be used by the couple (for example, if they want to do the ceremony on the beach, then cocktail hour in our terrace and reception on the garden).\nA: When a wedding can come together in person! It can be difficult to plan a wedding without seeing the areas and doing everything by email, so when a wedding is what the couples want; it is my favorite part.\nQ: What are the challenges brides face when planning their destination wedding at the resort?\nA: What time to end the event. Our outside events must ends at 10:00 pm. As a suggestion we offer to continue the party in our bar that closes at 12:30 am (not as a private event, as this bar is part of the all-inclusive) or to hold the event in our ballroom so it can run until 01:00 am. Extra-hours services may have additional costs.",

    "text": "\u2013 For building bridges from deterministic, linear and Cartesian thought and word use, by exploring our observations of the environments and their living systems affecting our ideals.\nA diverse work group of 6 to 20 people would be assembled, helped by a facilitator, needing about an hour to just go through the basic 3Step process. It\u2019s NOT a discussion group, of people offering opinions, but a learning group of people offering connecting observations. During the session they\u2019d need to be able to write as they talk, building on each other\u2019s observations, starting from being given or choosing an ideal goal to work with.\nThey\u2019d use that ideal to lead them on an exploration of what people in the group already know from observing their cultural, economic & ecological environments, sharing with each other things they\u2019ve seen are happening that could affect achieving the ideal. The product is a large collection of freshly shared observations on what\u2019s happening and how it connects; they\u2019d need to work with to proceed to planning for investments in changing their environment.\nTo work well in the UN\u2019s OWG setting, a few work groups might be organized in the same space, to work at the same time, each with their own facilitator. A prior process of facilitator training is needed, on now how to recognize environmental systems at work and ways of raising productive questions to help work groups fully explore what they know.\nFacilitators should have a combination of interests in human and natural economies, social science and natural science, some management and organizing experience. A facilitator\u2019s guide to the method and the systems science behind it is in preparation.\nIt\u2019s easy for people to talk about the ideals they\u2019d like to see in the world, and talk endlessly about them. Ideals don\u2019t tell you much about how to change the world to bring out your ideals, though. So I designed a very simple way to draw people into exploring the working parts of their own cultural & economic environments, that their ideals will need to work with, to help suggest practical interventions designed to \u201cwork with nature\u201d to bring out their ideals.\nI call it the 3Step process, and have been developing it in part prompted by Ambassador Korosi having showed some interest in my efforts to steer the OWG process toward studying what SDG\u2019s need to work with to succeed. People tend not to be drawn into thinking about how the complex connecting parts of their environments actually work together, though, being more comfortable just thinking and talking about how their own values and how their own mental environment works. But, if we have important ideals, that can only be achieved working with the world around us, that can draw people into learning how to turn their ideals (SDG goals) into practical ways to get involved (SDI interventions) to bring out their ideals in their real environment.\n3) Possible ways to intervene and bring out that ideal, working with those environments.\nNote: While others are talking try to both listen carefully and take quick notes on thoughts that come up as they speak. Ask the guide to suggest other things to look for if the flow of ideas lags. Don\u2019t be sidetracked to dwell on any one subject.\nDuring and after the discussion collect everyone\u2019s notes on a common note page, like a TitanPad, a chalk board, a Wiki etc., to solidify the rich variety of ideas discussed, understood as valuably interconnected starting points to think over in further study.\nThe process both brings people with different viewpoints together to see how useful the different things they\u2019re aware of about how their environments work can be when combined, and also to draw people into exploring just how much they already know themselves, freed to explore with interest what they\u2019ve observed about how things work, without preconception for how the information will be used.\nI tried using it in a Commons Cluster conference call a couple months ago. It worked splendidly to bring out lots of productive observations no one person could have collected. Some work on the method is still needed, to make it more of a real tool to use rather than just a cool way to bring up interesting new issues.\nIt\u2019s a scientifically designed method for bringing out what groups of people can see they\u2019ll need to work with in their environments to achieve their ideals. If developed as part of a process for designing real interventions to invest in for changing the environment, it will also help greatly expand the discussion general discussion of how to work with nature\u2019s working parts.\n3. Instead of the 3rd step, a period for discussing possible interventions at the end, you could have people take 5 minutes to work independently and write down one or two suggested intervention ideas to propose, in 20 words or less. Then to end the meeting each person could read theirs. That would end the meeting with a sort of \u201csurprise package\u201d of forward thinking, and help motivate people to contribute their notes to the wiki or public pad.\n4. for youth groups, after coming to a focus on some ideal they feel passionately about, you could make the environmental observations of Step 2 a guessing game, with each person getting a turn to think of and give hints to others trying to guess something they know of happening socially, economically, politically or ecologically that is important to take into account.\n5. somewhat like #1, you could have a 15min \u201cworld witness\u201d period just before coffee hour as a regular part of a church service. Some places it would be \u201ca crazy idea\u201d, other places not. The 3Steps approach is highly flexible and versatile, if you prepare a bit and get people to \u201cjust bear witness\u201d to what they can see happening that their ideals have to work with to get anywhere, expressing their awe of the natural world\u2019s movements and changes it is ours to deal with.\nGlad you\u2019re thinking about it. I\u2019ve been hoping to get feedback each time I offered the basic idea of the 3Step SDG design process, using our ideals for the \u201cworld we want\u201d to help us explore the real \u201cworld we have\u201d, to see what we have to work with. It\u2019s like going to \u201cdesign school\u201d, where the big task for an artist learning how to draw is first learning \u201chow to see\u201d. To change a particular environment, a designer needs to first learn to discover what\u2019s in the environment to work with, and like anything, it takes learning new habits.\nIt does help to have a vague idea what you\u2019re looking for, like the ideal statement of an SDG, but having any other preconception of what you\u2019re looking for will blind you to what\u2019s really there. As one instructor put it once, \u201cevery design should begin with reading book zero\u201d. It\u2019s usually the most important step in a design, and leads to getting the best kinds of results, just getting to know what there is to work with, in its own right.\nIn that way it\u2019s not so different from how anyone goes about designing a child\u2019s Halloween costume. There may be some vague image to begin with, but the real work begins with looking through the materials available, and then trying out this and that till you find a way to make something wonderful. I\u2019m sure you can think of lots of times where someone has only the vaguest idea of what they\u2019re planning on making until they\u2019ve rummaged through all the things that they might use.\nThat\u2019s the idea, anyway, to just get people to rummage through their cultural and economic environments, as if seeing and exploring them as if for the first time, learning about what they\u2019ll either have or need to work with to advance the ideal they want to design for. It\u2019s critically important to get the steps in the right order, and explore the materials of the environment you\u2019d need to work with before making a plan for what to do.\nIt\u2019s like going to \u201cdesign school\u201d, where the big task for an artist learning how to draw is first learning \u201chow to see\u201d. To change a particular environment, a designer needs to first learn to discover what\u2019s in the environment to work with, and like anything, it takes learning new habits.\nThis \u201clearning \u2018how to see'\u201d is the key issue for me in \u201ctransforming\u201d an old educational system that actual seems to close down that \u201copen-seeing\u201d to \u201cdiscarding\u201d any idea that isn\u2019t immediately familiar to one\u2019s already habituated \u201cways of seeing\u201d and some of the \u201cblinder prejudices\u201d (and some actually are indeed prejudices) that one has not learn well to easily \u201cexcavate\u201d and thus remain aware of, especially in understanding a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d environment.\nKey, so key to that is the ability to \u201clisten openly\u201d to those from that different environment and understand the world through their \u201cways of seeing\u201d and \u201chearing\u201d and more their analysis of the problem(s) to address. This is that critical \u201cdesign\u201d process step that is so key for me as an educator trying to train minds/eyes/ears and hearts to \u201csee\u201d in \u201cglobal\u201d more creative, right brain ways because otherwise too much of the non-linear, non-verbal communication is missed and thus the problem(s) itself poorly or only partly understood. This is that critical mis-step that I think too often sets us from the outside trying to help, for failure: you cannot really help solve problems you didn\u2019t really fully grasp.\nTrue \u201copen-mindedness\u201d in a reductionist, linearly, overly-rationally trained world or previous education system is to me the hardest and least understood of the skill-sets needed to do this. What I call the \u201cemotional/social and cultural intelligence skill sets\u201d that most \u201celitely-educated\u201d Westerners are negatively trained in, if at all (in worst cases creating unintended arrogance and ego-investment in \u201ctheir\u201d ideas over all others).\nThis is also a skill set that needs to be explicitly \u201cre-taught\u201d to combat this tendency. It is my \u201chardest\u201d work in trying to explain the underlying \u201ctransformative\u201d premise of the new educational model the TEF is supposed to represent, given that I and most of us involved in these issues at these levels were so \u201cwell-trained\u201d in the \u201cold\u201d more limiting frames.\nFor myself, I spent years \u201cre-learning\u201d this from the children I taught, so much more willing to teach me gently and because I could not at first \u201cunderstand\u201d why how I was taught to teach was actually \u201churting\u201d their learning and their hearts.\nThat was motivation enough to get me to understand why and why emotional intelligence and that necessary empathetic listening is so critical to all true learning.\nI\u2019m a natural systems scientist, that studies both how the organizations of nature develop and operate and also how they\u2019re perceived by popular and professional communities. Maybe the most profound thing I\u2019ve found is that \u201cpopular social culture trumps objective science\u201d just about everywhere. It seems to be because, for various reasons, \u201cscience doesn\u2019t work socially\u201d.\nWe need **something that works socially** for a human society to establish itself and be sustainable, a very basic social requirement seeming to stem from how human societies first developed. So\u2026. it\u2019s the social networks which end up being responsible for defining the foundations of our beliefs, and deciding what is meaningful to the society, creating our common reality and the nature of our experience of it.\nThe miracle is that all social networks more or less equally *experience* the natural world and how it works, but generally don\u2019t study it. As a result\u2026 we end up defining our shared ideas about reality without actually studying how the natural world works too. That social role in defining our cultural reality evidently holds true **even within the scientific and business communities**, as the basis for the many \u201csilos\u201d of exclusive knowledge that permit only their version of reality of the wider social agreement on the nature of the culture\u2019s common reality.\n\u2026\u2026 So to give social networks a better foundation on which to build our common \u201crealities\u201d I devised a neat trick. It\u2019s for getting them to look at what\u2019s happening in the natural world\u2019s, without any preconception as to \u201cwhat it\u2019s for\u201d.\nIt helps people notice how much they actually knew about how their world works but never put together before, and discover what they need to use and work with to get it to work for them, but may have never really asked before.",

The Bearcats, from NCAA Division III, fell to 1-3.\nSALEM, ORE. -- The first Bearcat Club luncheon of 2007-08 will take place Wednesday, September 19 at 12 p.m. (PDT) at the Mission Mill Museum's Dye House in Salem, Ore., and will feature three former Bearcats discussing their teams' championship seasons. All three teams are members of the Willamette Athletics Hall of Fame, with the 1997 team set to be inducted October 27, 2007.\nSALEM, ORE. -- Junior quarterback Grant Leslie (Bainbridge Island, WA/Bainbridge HS) and senior running back C.J. Washington (Spokane, WA/Shadle Park HS) each scored a rushing touchdown, and the Willamette University defense allowed just 115 total yards, as the Bearcats defeated California Lutheran University, 14-7, Saturday, Sept. 15 at McCulloch Stadium. Willamette, playing its first home game of the season, improved to 1-2. California Lutheran fell to 0-2.\nST. PETER, MINN. -- Gustavus Adophus College scored 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to rally from a 17-13 deficit and defeat visiting Willamette University, 34-25, on Saturday, Sept. 8 at Hollingsworth Field. The win allowed the Gusties to open the season at 1-0, while Willamette fell to 0-2.\nSALEM, ORE. -- Remember to get an early start to your day if you want to catch Bearcat football on Saturday, Sept. 8. The Bearcats will play at Gustavus Adolphus College, with kickoff at 11 a.m. on the West Coast.\nMONMOUTH, ORE. -- Western Oregon University built a 16-0 lead in the first half of its 23-9 win over Willamette University on Saturday, Sept. 1 at McArthur Field. Even so, Willamette outscored the Wolves 9-7 in the second half and ended the game with an impressive 10-play drive for the final touchdown of the night. The non-conference season opener matched the Bearcats, who compete in NCAA Division III, against WOU, which competes in NCAA Division II.\nSALEM, ORE. -- All of Willamette's football games this season will be broadcast on the Internet. Mike Allegre and Michael Plank will provide play-by-play and commentary of tonight's game at Western Oregon University.\nSALEM, ORE. -- Head Coach Mark Speckman and the Willamette University football team have set high expectations for themselves regarding the 2007 season. The players and coaching staff concentrated on quality during spring practices, remained focused throughout the offseason and arrived at preseason camp ready to practice and compete with great effort and determination. As a result, Speckman and his team anticipate great improvement over 2006, when the Bearcats finished 2-7, including 2-4 in the Northwest Conference (5th place).",

    "text": "How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nSubject: How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nI read in another post that iTunes uses a standard list of 125 genres.\nIs it possible to somehow limit the genres Jaikoz assigns to this list of 125 despite what MB or Discogs genres are?\nIt would be nice to have a checkbox that says \"Limit to iTunes genres\".\nI've just discovered the \"Filter/Non-standard-Genres/Non-standard Filters\" option so I guess I could use that to show me which ones are non standard then update them manually however it would be great to have a fuzzy matching option that matches non standard to iTunes standard genres.\nSubject: Re:How to reduce genres to only the 125 used by iTunes?\nYour best bet it to use the filter non-iTunes filters, non-standardFIlters limits to 255 genres but only half of these are in the predefined list provided by iTunes.\nHowever these options may be misleading you, although iTunes only recognises 125 genres by number you can still use any value to store a genre, it is just stored as text.\nThe Musicbrainz list is not limited in any sense so it would be rather difficult to map an arbitary Musicbrainz genre to an iTunes one.\nIs there anywhere in Jaikoz I can find the list of 255 genres that Jaikoz is using in this filter AND/OR the 125 iTunes genres so I can make sure that my collection only uses these \"standard\" ones?\nWould be good to have a cross matching facility, for example several of my songs have a genre \"Rock/Pop\" (a single genre) these could be matched to two seperate genres ie \"Rock\" and \"Pop\" then for anything not found in Jaikoz's cross matching genre database the User could enter a nominated genre ie \"Unknown\" so then you have a subset of your music (genre = \"Unknown\") you know needs to be listened to and a genre manually assigned.\nSo the the 125 genres listed are the one iTunes understands by genre number.\nPaul how about this ...if we got 50 people to each donate $10 OR reach $500 of donations (whichever comes first) would you add a genre cross matching function (as explained above) to Jaikoz? We could keep track by each person posting how much they have donated in this thread.\nI would rather see something like what mediamonkey has in some of their plugins. The ability to do white lists, black lists, and grey lists.\nThat way one would have far more control. For your example, you could use the white list and put in the allowed genres you have listed below. Or one could do a blacklist, which allows everything except for certain tags. This is useful for when you tag from other sources and don't want particular tags to show up. Say I tag from last.fm and don't want the tag \"seen live\" to be used. Lastly, the grey list would allow for tag replacement. So I could say anytime you run across the tag \"rock n roll\" replace it with \"rock and roll\" or \"rnb\" to \"r&b\", etc.\n2:The limited set of genres is incomplete and doesnt include newer genres , I dont see that this list should be seen as the definitive list.\nIn September I went to the yearly Musicbrainz Summit and genres were discussed there, see page 12 of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihe2nAatrLHfgPOvXWn_VJQVUVQ36iFy5MY03lTBhMM/edit?pli=1, hopefully a solution will emerge if you are interested in this it would be worth your while posting on the musicbrainz mailing list.\nJaikoz does already have a blacklist Preferences:Remote Correct:Correct Genres that supports wildcards, but not a whitelist or greylist, I can see these being useful additions.\nYes was already aware of this and although very helpful in stopping unwanted genres is not useful in correcting anything not on this list.\nI see limiting the list to the iTunes this to be a major advantage not a disadvantage even if its not a definitive list. Reason being is that people will always disagree on the exact genre of a song so its better to at least have a standard (the 125 iTunes genres) that people must stay within that way genres become a usable way (currently they are not due to so many genres) to sort, listen and create playlists since you know that when you select \"Rock & Roll\" genre you're getting all your Rock & Roll songs and don't also have to also look under \"Rock n Roll\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Rock/Roll\" etc.\nAs its stands there are currently so many permutations of genres it makes them unusable so it would be good to have an option in Jaikoz to \"force\" the use of only \"standard\" genres regardless of what MB or Discogs has assigned to them. Of course this wouldn't prevent people NOT enabling this option and still going with MB, Discogs or their own preferred genres.\nI think greengeek's idea of a white lists is a good way of implementing this ie the white list would be initially populated with only the 125 iTunes genres (however Users could edit this list).\nIn preferences you could \"enable\" the whitelist which tells Jaikoz to enforce the use of these genres only. You would nominate a genre (eg \"Unknown\") that Jaikoz would assign to any songs for genres not found on this whitelist.\nAgain greengeek's idea of a grey list is a good way of enabling Jaikoz to use this list to fuzzy match non standard genres to the iTunes standard genres (or whatever the User decides they want to cross match to) eg \"Rock n Roll\", \"Rock and Roll\", \"Rock/Roll\" would all be in the grey list and be assigned to the iTunes standard \"Rock & Roll\" OR a genre of the User's choice if they don't want to use iTunes standard ones.\nYes I like this idea of a grey list, although there is a complication. If the user decides to use both Discogs genres and styles, do we need multiple greylists ?\nI can't think of a scenario where you'd need two greylists as this list is really what the User wants Jaikoz to use to cross match to their \"standard\" genres regardless of where the currently assigned genre came from ie was already assigned to song or came from MB or Discogs lookup.\nAs previously mentioned, by having a checkbox for \"Replace unmatched genres with:\" [User entered genre ie \"Unknown\"] the User would also have an option of either leaving unmatched genres as is OR replacing them with their chosen genre which enables them to seperate out these songs for manual review at a latter date.",

The field includes four teams from the SEC, three from the ACC and Pac 12, one from the Big 10 and one from the Big 12.\nThis will be Clemson\u2019s sixth tournament of the year and second this spring. The Tigers have a 48-32-2 record against the field in the previous five events. Clemson returned Tuesday night from a 16th place finish at the Lady Puerto Rico Classic. J.T. Horton\u2019s team will take two freshmen, two juniors and a sophomore to this year\u2019s All-state Sugar Bowl Tournament.\nField: Alabama, Arizona, Clemson, Denver, Florida, LSU, Miami (FL), Michigan State, Mississippi State, Oklahoma State, Stanford, Texas, Tulane, UC Davis, UCF, UCLA, Virginia.\nFormat: Three 18-hole rounds each day Sunday through Tuesday, Feb. 21-23.\nClemson Lineup: Alice Hewson, Fr. (72.67); Lauren Stephenson, Fr. (73.33), Jessica Hoang, Jr. (75.92); Sloan Shanahan, Jr. (75.33); Marisa Messana, So. (76.56).\nTournament History: This will be Clemson\u2019s third appearance in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. The event was started by Clemson Head Coach J.T. Horton, who was the head coach at Tulane prior to coming to Clemson. Clemson finished fifth of 17 teams in 2014 and 14th of 15 teams last year. Sloan Shanahan, who will be in Clemson\u2019s lineup this weekend, finished sixth as a freshman at the Allstate Sugar Bowl with a 211 score, five-under-par. She had rounds of 71-70-70, the only time she has had three under-par rounds in the same tournament. Current junior Jessica Hoang had a 226 in the 2014 event and a 236 last year. She was Clemson\u2019s second best player last year. Messana was the top Clemson player in 2015 with a 235 score.\nClemson in 2015-16: Clemson has a 48-32-2 record against the field in its first six events. The fall was highlighted by a second-place finish at the Yale Women\u2019s Intercollegiate and a fifth-place at the Cougar Classic in Charleston. Clemson freshmen Alice Hewson and Lauren Stephenson have already combined for three victories. Hewson was co-medalist at the Cougar Classic and won the Lady Paladin Invitational, while Stephenson was co-medalist at Yale. Jessica Hoang and Lauren Stephenson were Clemson\u2019s top players last week in Puerto Rico. Hoang finished strong with scores of 72-73 in the last two rounds, while Stephenson had a 71 in the first round and was tied for sixth place. Both ladies finished 34th for the 54 holes with scores of 226.",

    "text": "I. Causes of Heart Failure: What every physician needs to know.\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable to provide sufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of the body, or is only able to do so with significantly increased intracardiac filling pressure. However, this is a somewhat older definition, and many people now define heart failure as a clinical syndrome where there is structural heart disease and impaired function.\nHeart failure is often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF). Many experts believe that the term \u201ccongestion\u201d does not uniformly apply to all patients, and the syndrome is often referred to as \u201cheart failure\u201d in more contemporary times.\nHeart failure is most often characterized as systolic, if ejection fraction (EF) is decreased, and diastolic, if ejection fraction is preserved. \u201cDiastolic\u201d heart failure is also often called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) or heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFPSF).\nSystolic heart failure is often due to damage to the heart, such as ischemia or alcohol exposure. Diastolic heart failure is often due to longstanding hypertension or intracardiac infiltration such as with amyloid protein, which \u201cstiffens\u201d both ventricles. It is not usually possible to distinguish systolic from diastolic heart failure based on signs and symptoms alone, as both share substantial clinical features.\nII. Diagnostic Confirmation: Are you sure your patient has Heart Failure?\nHeart failure is diagnosed at the bedside using history and physical findings. There is no absolute laboratory test for the diagnosis of heart failure.\nA characteristic history includes exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. Physical exam would be notable for volume overload (jugular venous distention, dependent edema), S3 gallop, and often pulmonary rales.\nHowever, it is important to note that the absence of rales does not exclude heart failure, as the lymphatic system can provide substantial compensation, particularly in patients with chronic heart failure. Pulmonary congestion is typically evident on chest radiography.\nPlasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) levels are typically elevated, although renal failure and obesity are commonly recognized confounders. The hallmark laboratory exam of heart failure is an echocardiogram.\nThe presence of a decreased EF is sufficient to give a diagnosis of systolic heart failure; other modalities such as gated nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or gated computed tomography (CT) are also able to determine EF.\nDiastolic heart failure is diagnosed in the presence of the clinical syndrome of heart failure with preserved EF. Efforts should be made to determine the etiology of heart failure.\nExertional dyspnea and fatigue are virtually universal. Volume overload is usually found, but in the modern era of powerful loop diuretics, some patients do not manifest fluid overload.\nNocturnal symptoms such as orthopnea and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) are also highly suggestive of heart failure. Abdominal discomfort or fullness is also a frequently reported symptom. Patients with well-compensated heart failure may have minimal symptoms and no evidence of volume overload. Characteristics of end-stage heart failure may include cachexia and Cheyne-Stokes respirations.\nApproximately half of patients with heart failure have systolic failure and the other half have diastolic heart failure. Some have features of both types. Heart failure is perhaps more common in men and in those who identify as black racially.\nRisk increases with age. Regardless, the most important risk factors for developing heart failure on a population basis are hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetes.\nThe majority of diastolic heart failure is a result of longstanding hypertension, and this phenotype of heart failure is more common in women. Infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis and hemochromatosis, also typically lead to diastolic heart failure, often with restrictive physiology.\nPrior chest radiation is another potential cause of diastolic heart failure, and the incidence may increase as prolonged cancer survivorship increases. Once patients are hospitalized with diastolic heart failure, the prognosis is approximately the same as systolic heart failure.\nHypertension and diabetes also increase the risk of systolic heart failure through the increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions. Thus efforts to minimize coronary artery disease would be anticipated to have substantial impact on risk of developing heart failure.\nThe causes of systolic heart failure are myriad, including coronary artery disease, genetic or familial, viral (including HIV), idiopathic, valvular, inflammatory (myocarditis, sarcoidosis), thyroid disease, tachycardia-mediated (often from previously unrecognized atrial fibrillation), stress-induced (also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), nutritional deficiency (such as thiamine or selenium), systemic myopathies (such as muscular dystrophies), and peripartum cardiomyopathy.\nAlcohol, cocaine, methamphetamines, anthracyclines, some antirheumatic medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are common toxic causes of heart failure, which are typically identified through patient history.\nCommon alternative causes of volume overload include renal failure, liver failure, and hypoalbuminemia. Common alternative causes of exertional breathlessness are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and pneumonia. Coronary artery disease also may present with a dyspnea-predominant phenotype, rather than chest pain, as is classically expected.\nEvaluation of the central venous pressure is of the utmost importance.\nProfoundly low cardiac output states may be characterized by hypotension and/or narrow pulse pressure along with cool or mottled skin.\nSinus tachycardia is common but may be compensatory.\nChest x-ray (CXR) and EKG are essential in the evaluation of a patient with suspected heart failure. Beyond providing information supporting the diagnosis of heart failure, these diagnostic tests often provide an alternative diagnosis (atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, lung mass, etc.) that implies heart failure may not be the key diagnosis.\nEchocardiogram is also essential and will provide substantial information about the size, structure, and function of the heart. MRI, which provides detailed information on the myocardium, should be considered.\nMRI can provide strong, noninvasive evidence of etiology in many cases, such as prior infarction, myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, stress or \u201cTakotsubo\u201d cardiomyopathy, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or hemochromatosis, for example. Positron emission tomography (PET) can also be used to diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis.\nEndomyocardial biopsy should be considered in highly select circumstances, such as suspicion of myocarditis. Biopsy also has a role in defining the subtype of amyloid cardiomyopathy (e.g., transthyretin versus amyloid light-chain (AL)). Patients with a family history of cardiomyopathy should be offered the option of referral for genetic counseling and testing.\nBNP (or NT-proBNP) should be considered, particularly if other causes of dyspnea such as COPD are being considered if there is doubt about the diagnosis. Very low levels virtually exclude heart failure, but can be confounded by obesity.\nElevated levels can be seen in renal failure without substantial heart failure, but at least suggest volume overload. Elevated BNP in the absence of renal failure is strongly suggestive of heart failure, but BNP levels are increased with age.\nBasic metabolic parameters including renal and hepatic function should be measured. Renal dysfunction may be a seen as a result of low cardiac output or elevated venous filling pressure.\nHepatic parameters (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) and international normalized ratio (INR) may be elevated as a consequence of hepatic congestion. Serum albumin is helpful in excluding malnutrition as an alternative explanation for peripheral edema.\nMinor elevations in troponin are characteristic of heart failure exacerbation, but typically do not rise and fall as in acute coronary syndrome; myocarditis should be considered if troponin is substantially elevated. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) would also be typically elevated in myocarditis, but are not diagnostic if elevated. Anemia (hemoglobin or hematocrit) and gout (uric acid) and are also frequent comorbidities to consider.\nAdditional testing to establish the etiology of heart failure should be considered and may include: HIV, ferritin (hemochromatosis), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and serum free light chains (amyloid), for example. Testing for specific viruses other than HIV is not routinely performed, but Coxsackie, Epstein-Barr, and varicella zoster could be considered. Exclusion of connective tissue disease with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is also often performed.\nCXR film (Figure 1) may show cardiomegaly, but the absence does not exclude heart failure. Pulmonary edema is an important finding, but can be confused with pneumonitis or other causes of diffuse infiltrates. Accompanying findings such as pleural effusions may be helpful in interpretation.\nChest x-ray film demonstrating cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.\nAn echocardiogram will provide size; structural detail, including evaluation of valves; and myocardial function, including EF and presence of absence of regional wall motion abnormalities. This is the most important test when considering heart failure as a diagnosis.\nAbdominal ultrasound may demonstrate hepatomegaly and/or ascites, although these findings are often evident on exam and thus are not routinely indicated.\nThe hallmarks of treatment of diastolic heart failure are control of congestion, heart rate in the presence of atrial fibrillation to increase ventricular filling time, and control of systolic blood pressure. The majority of evidence on the treatment of heart failure has been for systolic heart failure, and is thus the focus of the remainder of this section.\nThere are three \u201cto do\u2019s\u201d in the management of heart failure: (1) control congestion, (2) provide neurohormonal antagonists, and (3) consider sudden cardiac death prevention and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Since congestion causes most symptoms, this should be prioritized.\nCongestion control is achieved with sodium and sometimes (if there is hyponatremia) moderate fluid restriction; most patients need loop diuretics. Congestion is managed the same for systolic and diastolic heart failure.\nSecond, neurohormonal antagonists (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilators in select populations) are critical for the treatment of systolic heart failure and should be initiated. Although it is critical to use the drugs and doses that were found to be effective in landmark clinical trials, very few patients will tolerate initiation of full doses of these medications, and a period of uptitration over several weeks to months should be anticipated.\nThere is no consensus regarding whether beta-blockers or ACEI/ARB should be initiated first, and beta-blockers should be avoided in the setting of cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, or bronchospasm. Studies of neurohormonal antagonists for diastolic heart failure have been disappointing, but neurohormonal antagonists are still often used for their antihypertensive effect, and their safety in this population is well-established.\nAlthough there is no mortality benefit, digoxin has been noted to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of hospitalization. Finally, consideration should be given to \u201celectrical therapy,\u201d which consists of CRT (if QRS >130 ms) and sudden cardiac death prevention with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).\nThe risk of sudden cardiac death is much higher with an EF <35%, and in the absence of contraindications such as life expectancy less than 1 year, electrical therapy should be considered. Patients should be receiving optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months before implanting an ICD.\nWearable external defibrillators are sometimes used during the period of medical uptitration to permit reevaluation of EF; a sizable fraction of patients will improve on medical therapy to the point that an implantable ICD is not indicated.\nPatients who are unable to tolerate medical therapy or experience progression despite these therapies suggest a very poor prognosis and may be considered for advanced options, such as mechanical circulatory support (MCS, also known as ventricular assist device or VAD) or heart transplant.\nACEI/ARB and beta-blockers are both initiated at minimal dose, but uptitration of ACEI/ARB is typically prioritized, as full dose can typically be achieved more quickly. Beta-blocker dose is then increased every 1 to 2 weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Timing of the introduction of aldosterone antagonist is individualized based on need for diuretics and potassium supplementation, and often deferred to prioritize ACEI/ARB and beta-blockers.\nAdministration of diuretics is the hallmark of emergency treatment of heart failure and most patients respond promptly. Inadequate response should precipitate rapid escalation of a diuretic dose.\nA common rule of thumb is to double an ineffective dose. Consideration should be given to vasodilators if systemic blood pressure is adequate (e.g., mean arterial pressure greater than 70 to 75 mm Hg). In the event of hypotension or cardiogenic shock, initiation of inotropes, such as dobutamine and/or dopamine, may be necessary. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is an option and mechanical support such as an intraaortic balloon pump may also be indicated.\nIn addition to evaluation of symptomatic response, physical exam findings that should be monitored while providing treatment for heart failure include frequent evaluation of jugular venous pressure and vital signs, with particular attention to blood pressure and heart rate. Sinus tachycardia is often a compensatory response and improvement is thought to represent a favorable response to treatment.\nSerial examinations should also focus attention on the presence of absence of S3/S4, liver span, presence or absence of ascites, and degree and distribution of edema. Urine output should also be monitored, as this provides the most direct measure of pace of decongestion and also indicates adequate (or not) renal perfusion.\nBasic metabolic panels are typically performed shortly after initiation of therapy (at least daily while hospitalized), to monitor renal function and ensure that diuretics are not causing dangerous perturbations in serum potassium levels. Following initiation of aldosterone antagonists, more frequent monitoring of potassium is indicated.\nA commonly used strategy is 1 week after initiation or dose increase, and then again at 1 month. Once a stable medication regimen has been established, routine intermittent testing in heart failure patients is not typically performed. There is some data to suggest that BNP levels may be used to guide therapy.\nMaintaining patients with heart failure on maximally tolerated doses of neurohormonal antagonists (ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists) are critical to minimizing risk of disease progression, symptomatic decompensation, hospitalization, and mortality. Application of CRT when indicated has also been shown to improve outcomes, and should be periodically reconsidered, as patient status or criteria for implant may change over time.\nEducation on salt avoidance, the role of fluid restriction, and self-care including daily weight monitoring are all important to reduce burden of disease and avoid hospitalization. Over time, it is not uncommon for patients with heart failure to become intolerant to maximal doses of medical therapy.\nThe need to decrease the doses of medications is a predictor of adverse outcome, and may be an appropriate time to consider evaluation for advanced options. For patients with end-stage disease, palliative care and/or hospice may be appropriate, and deactivation of ICD may be considered.\nDigoxin is sometimes used in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with insufficient rate control. Typical dose is 62.5 to 250 mcg daily.\nConcurrent anemia: Treatment may improve heart failure symptoms.\nConcurrent arrhythmias: Consider the role that uncontrolled arrhythmias may have on heart failure exacerbation. Improved control of atrial fibrillation or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may improve symptoms. Many antiarrhythmics are contraindicated in severe heart failure.\nConcurrent chronic kidney disease: Continue ACEI/ARB if possible, but if necessary to discontinue, replace with isosorbide/hydralazine combination. May contribute to anemia. Aldosterone antagonists have a substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia.\nConcurrent diabetes: Avoid thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in all heart failure patients and metformin if there is significant renal dysfunction.\nConcurrent gout: It is likely that diuretic dosing will need to be increased if a gout flareup is treated with steroids.\nConcurrent liver disease: Liver congestion is common and may result in the need to alter dose of medications metabolized by the liver.\nConcurrent prostatic hypertrophy: Alpha blockers should be avoided, as they have been shown to increase mortality in heart failure patients.\nConcurrent sleep apnea: Should be treated aggressively to minimize neurohormonal activation.\nAldosterone antagonists should not be used in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease.\nConsider use of the Seattle Heart Failure Model or the Heart Failure Survival Score for estimating a patient\u2019s prognosis.\nConsider referral to dietitian to augment teaching on importance of low-salt diet.\nWeigh yourself at the same time every day and record the result. Report increases of more than 3 lb in a day or 5 lb in a week to your doctor; however, not all decompensations are preceded by antecedent weight gain.\nAvoid sodium intake and strive to keep less than 2,000 mg daily.\nTake your medications as prescribed every day.\nReport changes in symptoms promptly.\n\u201c2009 Focused update incorporated into the ACC/AHA 2005 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines.

    "text": "Buy stocks now that will stand the test of time and pay you to invest.\nWe love talking about the hot stocks here on the blog but what about the stocks you can buy and know they\u2019ll produce solid returns for decades?\nHow do you find those forever stocks you can buy and just sit back and collect the checks?\nIt\u2019s something every investor needs to know. Gone are the days you could just park your money in huge companies like GE and feel confident that your money will be there when you retire.\nIn this video, I\u2019ll reveal the three factors I look for when buying stocks for the long-term and five stocks to buy right now.\nNow I love to buy deep-value stocks and benefit from that near-term rebound. Perfect example is the Hanesbrands position in our 2019 Stock Market Challenge. I saw rising online sales and strength in the activewear segment ahead of a 52% surge in the shares.\nBut you also need to be investing for the long-term, right? We want to be building a portfolio that benefits from quick wins but one where our stocks are going to withstand the test of time.\nFortunately, there is a way to get both. Get that short-term pop plus the long-term returns that will beat your investing goals, or as I call them, forever stocks.\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing today. In this video, I\u2019ll show you the three factors I look for when picking stocks to buy for the long-term. I\u2019ll cover each factor then I\u2019m going to be revealing five stocks to buy right now that I think will produce those double-digit returns over the next 30 years.\nThe first factor I\u2019m looking for in forever stocks is a dividend yield and there are a few reasons for that.\nFirst is that, stocks that pay dividends just tend to do better. Now this graphic is a little jumbled but groups of stocks paying dividends and those with a history of growing their dividends are the blue lines at the top while no-dividend stocks and those cutting their cash payouts are the two bottom lines. The research this was based on has been sliced and diced every way but the simple truth is that dividend-paying companies beat the market.\nOne of the reasons for this is because that dividend payout acts as cash discipline on management. It\u2019s harder to spend on those questionable projects if you know you\u2019ve got to meet that $400 million dividend payment at the end of the quarter.\nThat dividend payment is like having some of your paycheck automatically invested instead of it sitting in your checking account tempting you to spend it on whatever commercial you see next. If you just don\u2019t have the money sitting around, you\u2019re less likely to spend it on stupid crap you don\u2019t need.\nAnother reason I want to be investing in dividend stocks is because it\u2019s always a positive return. This chart shows the percentage of return from dividends and price in each decade. Dividends might be a small part of your return when the market is booming like in the 90s but when the stock market crashes, that dividend return may be all you collect. Thirty years is a lot of bear markets so having those dividend stocks is going to be a lot of protection.\nNow when I\u2019m looking for dividend stocks, I want a company paying a yield of at least 2%. That\u2019s the average dividend yield on the S&P 500 so I like to look for stocks paying maybe a little above average.\nI also want to look at the payout ratio though and this is something we\u2019ve talked about before. The payout ratio is the percentage of profits paid out to cover the dividend. I like to see a payout ratio of 60% or less so I know the company is keeping enough money back for growth as well as making those cash payments.\nSo obviously you know I\u2019m all about dividend stocks but there\u2019s another side of investing, looking at companies with the fastest growth. Think names like Tesla, Netflix and Amazon. This growth investing can be just as profitable or more than dividend investing so I need your opinion. Which do you want to see more videos about, dividend or growth investing. Just scroll down below the video and let me know in the comments.\nAn important note here, any type of investing can get really expensive if you\u2019re buying and selling a lot. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using M1 Finance for our 2019 stock market challenge for a no-fee investing option that saves thousands.\nThe second factor I\u2019m looking for in these long-term stocks to buy is going to take advantage of big macro trends. This means finding companies that will benefit from those large, universal trends like aging populations, food demand, automation.\nWe\u2019re talking the massive, unstoppable forces that will unfold over decades. This kind of long-term investing is the best thing you can do for your portfolio and it\u2019s really how some of these hedge funds managers like Seth Klarman make their billions.\nThis is one of my favorite ways to invest because it makes it so easy. You\u2019re looking at these big trends and thinking, OK which sectors or industries of the economy will benefit? Those forces are going to drive demand for every company in that sector and industries so once you answer that question, you just look for the leaders in the group.\nThe best part is, you don\u2019t have to pick that one best company because all the players in the group will benefit from these massive shifts.\nSome of the biggest macro trends I\u2019m watching include aging populations, so the fact that 10,000 Americans are reaching retirement age everyday and that\u2019s going to affect everything from government services to consumer spending.\nFood demand, global agricultural production just isn\u2019t keeping up with demand, obviously automation and artificial intelligence will bring huge shifts in work and other areas.\nBig data, and especially with the coming 5G networks I think will bring a wave of changes. Finally the shift in economic and political strength to Asia and here we\u2019re not only talking about China which is the big one but also India and other parts of the region.\nThe third factor I\u2019m looking for in long-term stocks is going to be just as important and that\u2019s companies safe from the destruction in those macro trends. Just as a lot of opportunities are created from those massive trends, there\u2019s also going to be that creative destruction that is the hallmark of capitalism.\nWith this one, think of entire industries like newspapers and magazines. Think of once hugely successful companies like Kodak that, while it\u2019s survived, it\u2019s hard to argue that the company is the giant it used to be.\nHere I\u2019m thinking about industries at risk from automation and AI and we\u2019re not just talking about making the industry obsolete but the kind of change that will be hard for companies to keep up with.\nThere will always be a need for banking but the evolution to online banking, peer-to-peer lending and even digital currencies is making it very difficult for banks to keep up. You could have a best-of-breed bank stock but if they aren\u2019t constantly adapting to these changes, it\u2019s not going to last the thirty years.\nI\u2019m also looking at companies at risk to big regulatory concerns and what we\u2019ll just call Death-by-Amazon. So here I want to stay away from pharmacy retail and drug makers, not because I think those industries won\u2019t be around but because these big risks are evolving so quickly that a lot of companies won\u2019t be able to keep up.\nSo those three factors are guiding my long-term investments but of course, I\u2019m still doing that deep fundamental analysis when I pick stocks. I\u2019m looking at cash flows and profitability like we\u2019ve talked about in other videos and finding companies with a distinct advantage over competitors.\nI know it\u2019s a lot but nobody said finding the best stocks for the next 30 years would be easy. Now I\u2019m going to reveal five names that I think could make the cut. Some of these are going to be pretty safe bets while others could be a little more risky.\nOur first stock is an anchor for a lot of portfolios, Campbells Soup, ticker CPB. The $10 billion leader in packaged foods controls 60% of the canned soup market and a strong position in snacks and beverages. That kind of market share and size gives it negotiating power against retailers in shelf-space and pricing.\nManagement has made some missteps over the last couple of years but has also been the victim of some bad economics in food packaging. Food costs have been rising at around 3% annually but companies haven\u2019t been able to pass these increases on to customers so profitability has suffered. Shares have fallen about 45% since mid-2016 but represent some great value right now.\nManagement has already driven $550 million in cost savings and expects another $400 million through 2022 which should rekindle some profitability. They\u2019re also expecting to announce buyers for the international business and Bolthouse Farms Fresh segment by the end of the year. The two segments represent about $2.1 billion in revenue so I\u2019m modeling around $4 billion from buyers that will significantly help to pay down some of that debt that\u2019s acting as an overhang on the shares.\nEarnings are expected 0.8% lower over the next four quarters but the company has a strong history of beating expectations. I\u2019m forecasting $2.55 in earnings per share on stronger profitability which would put the shares around 14-times on a price-to-earnings basis.\nThe shares trade at a price of just 1.1-times sales which is a 40% discount to the five-year average and almost half the two-times average price-to-sales multiple in the industry so some good value here.\nBesides a great valuation, solid dividend and just the strength of the company\u2019s business, I love Campbells here for a potential catalyst. Activist hedge fund Third Point has been battling the company for years to unlock shareholder value and take control from the Dorrance family. The hedge fund owns about 7% of the shares and finally won an agreement last November to add two of its nominees to the board of directors.\nThat means shareholders have a strong voice on the board that is expert in increasing value. The hedge fund has said everything is on the table including a breakup of the company or asset sales to unlock value and investors get paid a 3.9% dividend while they wait.\nSo I like Campbells but you\u2019re thinking, mmmm I just don\u2019t see soup as a growth market that\u2019s going to jump over the next 30 years. What else ya got for me?\nChina Mobile, ticker CHL, hits our list of stocks to buy for the long-term next. Just about every U.S. company has a \u2018china\u2019 plan to break into some part of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Even though the U.S. economy is still about twice as big, China\u2019s economy is adding almost twice the value to its economy every year because it\u2019s growing so fast.\nGetting exposure to that growth through U.S. companies with sales in China just isn\u2019t enough. EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR needs to own some Chinese domestic stocks and China Mobile is one of my top picks.\nThe telecom company controls 61% of the 4G market and 60% of the total wireless market. With 916 million subscribers, it\u2019s the largest telecom in the world and despite this ginormous size already, it\u2019s still posting some astonishing growth. China Mobile also became the country\u2019s largest fixed broadband provider last year, controlling 42% of the market and accounting for 73% of all new broadband customers versus the other two telecoms China Unicom and China Telecom.\nChina is determined to be the leader in 5G, it\u2019s said so publicly and this is one of the first tech evolutions where it really has a chance to set the pace and it\u2019s going to do it. That\u2019s going to open up a lot of opportunity for telecoms and the broader economy. IoT smart connections among corporate clients increased 154% in the first half of last year to 384 million, that\u2019s already more than the entire population of the United States.\nBehind all this growth is also one of the strongest balance sheets I\u2019ve seen with $70 billion in cash, that\u2019s more than 30% of the company\u2019s stock market value. For comparison, Apple\u2019s cash stock pile is less than 10% of its market value and China Mobile is generating over $7.6 billion in free cash flow every year.\nShares pay a 3.9% dividend yield and the company pays out 48% of profits to the dividend which is solid but still obviously leaves lots of money for growth. At a price-to-sales ratio of two-times which is just under the 2.15-times average over the last five years, the shares aren\u2019t a bargain here but the long-term potential is undisputed.\nThere is one major drawback to China Mobile, the controlling ownership by the Chinese government. As the controlling shareholder and regulator of all three domestic telecom operators, the government is a limiting force on how powerful any one company can become. In fact, over the last decade, it\u2019s swapped out the CEOs of the companies twice to try distributing management experience and knowledge. The upside to all of this is that the Chinese market will continue to grow and the government wouldn\u2019t consider letting anyone else play beyond the three established companies so you basically have an implicit guarantee for China Mobile.\nConAgra Foods, ticker CAG, is one I added to our 2019 Dividend Portfolio in February. The company is a U.S. powerhouse in prepared meals where it\u2019s the second-largest in the industry. It has a 40% market share in canned tomatoes and more than a fifth of the meat snacks market with Slim Jim. The company has some solid brands in that relatively safer consumer staples sector so we\u2019re talking dividends as well as a recession-proof industry.\nManagement fumbled big time with last year\u2019s Pinnacle acquisition and had to lower the profit outlook by 20% late last year. The problems were centered around Pinnacle\u2019s distribution business so a little harder to read but management has been very transparent since December about its plans going forward. I think they\u2019re being overly conservative on estimates for a 5% sales decline and margin loss on the Pinnacle assets so the next surprise could be on the upside when things come out better than expected.\nDespite the missteps, the Pinnacle deal still brought a lot of opportunity to the company with a position in the faster-growing frozen foods space. Consumer data is showing millennials are adopting frozen meals at a higher rate than previous generations and it\u2019s hard to imagine a tech shift that could put this industry in jeopardy.\nShares of ConAgra pay a 3.9% dividend which management has affirmed with its new 2019 outlook and trade for just 9.9-times trailing earnings, that\u2019s a 41% discount to the price multiple where it was trading in November. Cash flow is still solid and management is expecting $215 million in cost savings through 2022 on the acquisition. The average analyst price target is 50% higher than the current price and even the lowest price target is 8% higher.\nNext we have the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, ticker VNQ, which is probably my favorite exchange traded fund and another in our 2019 challenge portfolio. It holds shares of 187 real estate companies spread across all the property types and across the United States.\nEveryone in the community knows I\u2019m a huge believer in real estate. I got my first professional job as a commercial property analyst while in college, I\u2019ve managed my own rental properties and have seen real estate create more fortunes than any other asset. Real estate is truly a generational wealth-builder and will always be in demand.\nThe fund pays a 4.2% dividend yield and has returned 14.7% annually over the last decade. Beyond the solid cash yield and return, this is a great opportunity to take a little risk out of the stock market and have it in a real physical asset like property.\nThe fund has been under pressure over the last couple of years because of those rising interest rates. Obviously with the leverage used in real estate, any time you have rising rates, that\u2019s going to weigh on returns but the Fed has signaled no more rate hikes this year and that could unleash a lot of value in real estate.\nWe saw the real estate fund in blue here outperforming stocks through 2017 when rates started heading higher. Looking more recently with that market crash last year and we\u2019re seeing real estate outperform again.\nNow I know I said I wanted to stay away from pharmaceutical stocks because of that potential for regulatory problems over drug prices but I think Cardinal Health, ticker CAH, deserves a spot on the list. The $15 billion leader in medical supplies and pharmaceutical distribution to hospitals and pharmacies is diversified enough that I think it can withstand some of that regulatory risk.\nThe biggest reason I\u2019d overlook that risk of problems with drug pricing is the company\u2019s position in one of the biggest and surest demographic trends, the aging population. The very middle of the Baby Boomer generation, those born in 1955, turn 64 years old this year. That still puts a tidal wave of people over the next two decades that will be increasing the demand for healthcare.\nBetween AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, these three companies control 90% of the pharmaceutical wholesale market in the country. Even if we do see true enthusiasm for drug price controls from the government, which is a long-shot to start, then I think it\u2019s likely the industry can negotiate a compromise that still maintains solid profits while moderating price increases.\nManagement has identified over $300 million in cost savings it can drive this year and next which could rocket free cash flow. Shares pay a 3.8% dividend yield and the payout has grown at an 8% annualized clip over the last five years.\nAnalysts are only expecting 2.4% earnings growth to $5.10 per share over the next year but the company has a history of thrashing expectations. Over the last two years, management has surprised on the upside by 14% over expectations with even stronger results lately. Even the estimate though puts the shares at 10-times earnings so definitely some value in this one.\nFinding stocks to buy now isn\u2019t the only question you need to ask as investor. It\u2019s just as important to find the investments that will not only grow your money but the companies that will be around when you retire. Use a few basic screens and analysis to find these forever stocks to invest your money and have the confidence that it will be there when you need it.",

    "text": "Yoga guru Baba Ramdev Saturday criticised the Congress party for nominating cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar to the Rajya Sabha, calling it a ploy to distract public attention.\n\u201cCongress, which is a sinking ship, denied him (Tendulkar) the Bharat Ratna but is nominating him to the Rajya Sabha as a tactic to distract the media and people from issues such as black money and corruption,\u201d said Ramdev at a press conference here.\n\u201cIf inducting cricketers and celebrities in parliament can bring back black money back into the country, I request the people in power to induct every cricketer and celebrity,\u201d he said.\nHe claimed that political pressure was being put on Tendulkar from several quarters to accept the nomination.\nOn his decision to join hands with activist Anna Hazare to fight corruption, Ramdev said \u201cpolitical forces\u201d were questioning his decision.\n\u201cSome corrupt corporates and political leaders are not comfortable with us coming together. So, they keep questioning our unity,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNeither Anna Hazare nor me claimed that we were going to unite our two campaigns. But we\u2019ll keep coming together whenever needed just like we have planned for June 3,\u201d he said.\nRamdev said there was no rift between him and Hazare, and that their \u201cfrequencies matched\u201d.\nHe said just and equitable institutions needed to be put in place of corrupt institutions. For this, he would keep a fast along with Hazare at Jantar Mantar on June 3.\nDuring the press meet, Ramdev also announced his itinerary for the thrid part of his Bharat Swabhiman Yatra. He said the journey would start May 1 and end June 3 with the fast at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.\n\u201cDuring the \u2018yatra,\u2019 people in power will try to malign me, which is expected. But when that happens, I request the media to also hear our side of the story so that the complete picture can come out in the public,\u201d he said.\nAfter a gap of six months portals of famous Himalayan shrine Kedarnath today reopened for pilgrims. The temple, situated in Rudraprayag district at a height of 3,584 meter, was reopened at 0715 hours in the morning according to \u2018mahurat\u2019, sources said.\nThe \u2018mahurat\u2019 was decided on Mahashivrati at Ukhimath area on February 20. The head priest of the temple, Rawal, performed the \u2018Abhishek\u2019 after openeing of the doors, sources said. Thousands of pilgrims flocked the temple after opening of the doors.\nThe Chardhams, comprising the shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri in Garhwal Himalayas reopen for pilgrims in April-May every year after remaining closed for nearly six months during winters as the area remain snow-bound during the period. The annual Chardham yatra is considered as a backbone of the thriving religious tourism in the state that attracts nearly 15-16 lakh pilgrims every year from home and abroad.\nDelhi\u2019s anti-corruption ombudsman Manmohan Sarin today advocated the need for social boycott of the corrupt and rued the \u201cindifference\u201d of the silent majority towards the menace.\n\u201cUnless people condemn, despise, and excommunicate the dishonest, the corrupt will continue to enjoy status and respect in society\u201d, Sarin said speaking at the launch of \u2018Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre Helpline\u2019 by Transparency International India.\n\u201cThe indifference of silent majority is the real cause of corruption. Till you are not personally affected by corruption, you look the other way\u201d, he said. The Lokayukta lamented that complicated laws and lengthy judicial procedures help the corrupt to go scot free.\n\u201cCorrupt people go scot free due to long time of trial and I have no hesitation in saying that the truth is that people with money get away\u201d, he said. \u201cLaws are complicated and are not citizen friendly which gives an opportunity to authorities for corrupt practises\u201d, he said. He asked the media to run a sustained campaign against corruption. \u201cThe media should not stop at just one report.\nIt has to be a sustained campaign against wrong. It is the duty of media\u201d, he said. Advocating administrative and financial autonomy for Lokayukta office, he said that in states where the Chief Minister is not included under Lokayukta, the Lokayukta does not face any problem. \u201cStates where the Chief Minister does not come under Lokayukta Act, there is no problem faced by the Lokayukta\u201d, he said.\nHe said that instilling moral and ethical values in people at young age can help in tackling corruption. \u201cThe fall in moral values in society is also to be blamed for rising corruption.\nWe should catch people young and give them moral and ethical values\u201d, he said. The toll free helpline number of \u2018Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre\u2019 by Transparency International India will inform citizen about their legal rights, provide legal assistance and equip them to take action on cases of corruption that they have been victims of.\n\u201cA victim of corruption can call our helpline and take legal advice from our lawyer. After that if they need any assistance in drafting complaint and approaching the right department, our team will help them\u201d, P S Bawa, Chairman Transparency International India said. Transparency International India is the accredited India chapter of the international civil society organisation based in Berlin.\nMegastar Amitabh Bachchan today said that actress Rekha and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar \u201cdeserved\u201d to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha.\n\u201cIn each session of Parliament, President nominates few set of people for Rajya Sabha from the fields of art, film etc.\nIt is an honorary position. Whoever nominated for this (Rajya Sabha) are deserving people (sic),\u201d Big B told reporters at an event held for promotion of his soon-to-be-released film, \u2018Department\u2019. \u201cI remember even (actress) Nargisji was nominated for Rajya Sabha,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the nomination of the maestro to the Upper House seems to have not gone down well with actor Sanjay Dutt. \u201cIt is an honour to be in Rajya Sabha. I am a die-hard fan of Sachin\u2026he is a pride\u2026jewel of India. But I am not happy that he is a Rajya Sabha member\u2026.he should have been the way he is,\u201d Dutt said.\nWhen asked if being a parliamentarian will be too demanding for Rekha and Sachin, Bachchan said, \u201cIt is their personal decision\u2026leave it to them\u201d. Meanwhile, filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma, who was also present on the occasion, evaded direct reply on the issue, saying, \u201cI have no idea about cricket and politics\u201d.\nISRO has said the indigenously built Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1), launched on April 26, has been placed in its final Polar Sun-synchronous Orbit of 536 km height.\n\u201cPSLV-C19 had placed RISAT-1 in a polar orbit of 470 km X 480 km. As planned, on April 27-28, the satellite propulsion system was used in four orbital manoeuvres to raise the height of the orbit of RISAT-1 to 536 km,\u201d ISRO said in a statement here.\nThe satellite is now in its final orbital configuration and in good health. In the coming days, various elements of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar will be tested and calibrated as a prelude to payload operations, it said.\n\u201cAs compared to the optical remote sensing satellites that depend upon sunlight, the Synthetic Aperture Radar of RISAT-1 transmits its own radar pulses (at 5.35 GHz) to study the objects on Earth. This facilitates (i) cloud penetration and (ii) imaging even without sunlight. For RISAT-1, imaging sessions around both 6 AM and 6 PM have been chosen,\u201d it said.\nThe 1,858 kg RISAT-1, whose images will facilitate agriculture and disaster management, was launched on board the PSLV-C19 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, around 90 km from Chennai.\nThe Amnesty International has appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take steps for immediate release of all protesters arrested in connection with the anti-Koodankulam Nuclear plant agitation and drop \u201cfalse\u201d charges against them.\nAmnesty International members also referred to S.P.Udhayakumar, PMANE convenor\u2019s charge that the Indian authorities had \u201cfailed\u201d to respond satisfactorily to several site and safety concerns raised by an independent group of experts.\nThey expressed \u201cdismay\u201d that officials belonging to the Home Ministry searched Udhayakumar\u2019s home and that police had \u201charassed\u201d shop-keepers who were in solidarity with the protesters.\n\u201cThe charges against the protesters constitute a deliberate attempt by the authorities to silence them despite the fact that the protests had been peaceful,\u201d the letter to the Prime Minister said.\nAmnesty International members who have signed the letter include senior functionary Peter Cattan of Switzerland. A copy of the letter was released to the press here today.\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh Saturday hinted at an impending hike in fuel prices saying that there is need for such an exercise to balance the effects of the spiralling oil import bill.\n\u201cWith imports accounting for about 80 percent of our crude supplies, the spiralling prices of crude in the international market have put a severe strain on our import bill,\u201d Singh said in a speech while inaugurating a refinery here.\n\u201cWe also need to rationalize prices and at the same time ensure that the poor and needy are shielded from the effects of such a rationalization,\u201d he said.\nThe prime minister\u2019s comments came in the wake of demands by oil marketing companies (OMCs) which say they either be allowed to raise petrol prices or the government should compensate them for the underrecoveries. The OMCs say their inability to raise prices from Dec 16, 2011 to March 31, 2012 has resulted in total under-recovery of Rs.2,287 crore.\n\u201cThe challenges we face on the energy front are formidable. We need adequate supplies of energy at affordable prices. Domestic sources of crude oil and gas are inadequate to meet the growing demands of our rapidly expanding economy,\u201d he said.\nIndia also needed to conserve energy and there was \u201cno room for inefficient and wasteful usage of fuel\u201d, said the prime minister.\nThe 60 Years of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s reign will be celebrated in Britain with Rajasthani touch.\nThe 11-member Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band will perform in London June 2 and 3 rubbing shoulders with famous artists like Elton John in presence of heads of several states and world renowned personalities.\n\u201cThe organising committee of these events examined our previous international performances over the past ten years and selected the Jaipur Maharaja Brass Band to perform at London,\u201d the band\u2019s group leader Amrit Hussain said.\n\u201cIt is a very big event and we are unable to express our happiness in words. We expect to enthrall the audience and our aim is to give a taste of Indian music to the international audience with Indian and Rajasthani traditional music with a mix of Western instruments,\u201d he added.\nThe band will use a mix of traditional Indian and Western instruments to perform popular Bollywood, jazz, pop and self-composed music, making it the first group from India to perform at such an event, Hussain claimed.\nHe said over the past nine years, the band has performed at about 600 concerts in 40 countries. It has participated in prestigious music festivals like Sziget (Hungary), Paleo (Switzerland), and Pori Jazz Fest (Finland).\nOriginating from Jaipur, the city of the maharajas, the band consists of seven to eight musicians, a female traditional Rajasthani dancer and a juggler or fire eater. They play a range of traditional brass instruments, including trumpets, trombones, tubas, clarinets, tabla, base drum and saxophones and perform traditional dances.\nAmrit said that roots of the Indian brass band music go deep into the subcontinent\u2019s colonial past.\n\u201cIntroduced in the middle of the 18th century by the British, thousands of brass bands play at carnivals, national or religious festivals and local marriage celebrations across the country. In Rajasthan alone, there are over 2,000 brass bands performing regularly,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe have tried to include in our team the best performers out of the 2,000-odd brass bands,\u201d he added.\nIn a move to curb corruption in government offices, Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda has given his consent to an ordinance to set up special courts which will have the power to seize/attach properties of corrupt officials.\n\u201cChief Minister Munda has given his approval to set up \u2018Jharkhand special court ordinance 2012\u2032. The ordinance has been sent to the governor for notification,\u201d an official of the Chief Minister\u2019s Office (CMO) told IANS Saturday.\nThe special courts will issue notices within 30 days of the petition against the tainted officers.\nTo fight corruption in government offices, Jharkhand has already formulated the Right to Services Act and the Electronic Delivery Services Act.\nIndia\u2019s nominee, Justice Dalveer Bhandari, a sitting judge of the Supreme Court, has been elected to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the first time an Indian has managed to get this key international post in over two decades.\nBhandari secured 122 votes in the United Nations General Assembly against 58 for his Filipino rival, Syed Akbaruddin, the spokesperson of the external affairs, said here.\nIn simultaneous elections Friday at the UN headquarters in New York, Bhandari also secured an absolute majority in the Security Council.\nIn the election to the ICJ, a primary judicial organ of the United Nations, commonly referred to as the World Court, Bhandari was locked in a fierce contest with Justice Florentino P. Feliciano of the Philippines.\nBhadari takes the place of Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh of Jordan who resigned from the Asia-Pacific region seat at the end of 2011.\nAn eminent legal luminary, Bhandari will serve the remainder of the term 2012-18. India was last represented at the ICJ more than two decades ago.\nThe 64-year-old Justice Bhandari has variegated experience in international law and is well-versed with the working of the UN. Bhandari has been on India\u2019s apex court since 2005 and has served in the higher Indian judiciary for over two decades. He will retire in September this year. He served as the chairperson of the Delhi Centre of the International Law Association for several years.\nBhandari is also a member of leading international academic and legal bodies and is closely associated with a large number of committees dealing with various aspects of international law such as: human rights, biotechnology, sustainable development, securities regulation, trade, nuclear weapons, non-proliferation and contemporary international law and space.\nAcknowledging his outstanding contribution, the Northwestern University School of Law, Chicago, US while celebrating its 150 Years (1859-2009) selected Bhandari as one of its 16 most illustrious and distinguished alumni.\nIn New Delhi, the Supreme Court Thursday had refused to quash Bhandari\u2019s nomination as a judge for the ICJ.\nEstablished in June 1945 by the charter of the United Nations, in The Hague, Netherlands, ICJ\u2019s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorised United Nations organs and specialised agencies.",

    "text": "Western Sahara is on the Atlantic coast of north-west Africa, between Morocco to the north and Mauritania to the south and east and Algeria to the north-east.\nThe area of Western Sahara is 266,000 sq km of which 180,000 sq km (68%) is occupied by Morocco and 86,000 sq km (32%) is controlled by SADR, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic.\nIn the eighties Morocco divided the territory with a 1,800 km wall or berm made of sand, stone, landmines and barbed wire. The wall is watched over by radars, artillery, and air force, and is protected by 160,000 armed soldiers. Another 920 km of walls have been built inside the occupied area.\nWestern Sahara is rich in mineral resources, including phosphate mineral rock which Australia imports contrary to international law. Western Sahara has one of the best fishing grounds in the world. Currently its off-shore oil resources are being explored.\nMorocco invaded Western Sahara in 1975 when Spain abandoned its former colony. Mauritania seized part of the land, but soon made peace with the Polisario Front, the Saharawi people\u2019s political organisation, which continued the fight against Morocco.\nMany Saharawis fled the tanks and aerial bombardments of napalm and cluster bombs of the Moroccan invaders and set up refugee camps near Tindouf in south-west Algeria where more than 165,000 of them now live supported by the UN Food Program and other humanitarian aid.\nThose who remained in their homeland have constantly faced arrest, imprisonment, death and \u201cdisappearance\u201d at the hands of Moroccan occupying forces. Their escape is blocked by a 2,400km wall dividing Western Sahara into the coastal zone occupied by Morocco and the interior part held by the Polisario Front.\nIn 1975 the International Court of Justice held that Western Sahara was not terra nullius at the time of its colonisation by Spain and that neither Morocco nor Mauritania had sovereignty over it at that time.\nThe war between Morocco and the Polisario continued until an UN-African Union brokered a ceasefire in 1991.\nThe UN has arrangements in place for a referendum of self-determination of the Saharawi people but Morocco refused to allow the referendum to be held.\nWhile life is scarcely viable in the harsh Hamada desert where the refugees live, as there are no means for self sufficiency, the Saharawis living in occupied Western Sahara suffer the terrible oppression already noted.\nMINURSO was established to organise a referendum for self-determination of the Saharawi people in 1992 as part of peace process between Morocco and Polisario.\nBy 1996 the peace process was in stalemate.\nIn 1997, James Baker (George H. Bush\u2019s Secretary of State) became a UN envoy and drew up a new plan for the referendum, the Framework agreement on the Status of Western Sahara. Morocco refused to co-operate.\nIn 2003 Baker made a new plan, known as Baker Plan II \u2013 Peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. This was accepted by the UN and the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Morocco still refuses to allow UN sponsored referendum to take place.\nSince May 2005, there has been an increase in this oppression. Peaceful demonstrations have been brutally put down. Many Saharawis have been arrested and imprisoned. Some have been tortured and some have \u201cdisappeared\u201d. Women and children have been assaulted in their own homes and their property stolen by Moroccan police and soldiers. Outsiders, including parliamentarians from the European Union, Spain and Norway have been refused entry to Western Sahara. So have human rights bodies from Norway and elsewhere.\nThe Saharawis have their own democratically elected government, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), with men and women ministers and parliamentarians. Its officials run the camps. SADR is recognised as the legitimate government of Western Sahara by at least 80 countries, most recently by the Republic of South Africa and Kenya. It is a member of the African Union.\nIn May 2005 in preparation for the full recovery of all of the Western Sahara territory SADR announced the commencement of a licensing initiative to enable international oil and gas companies to participate in the exploration of its offshore territory.\nThis licensing initiative is open to all competent and qualified companies and has been arranged in accordance with the UN legal opinion regarding commercial activities in Western Sahara.\nSADR believes that development of its significant natural resources will play an important part in developing a self-reliant, democratic and progressive nation in Western Sahara.\nThe present situation cannot continue. The oppression of the Saharawis in occupied Western Sahara must stop. The refugees in the camps must feel safe to return to their own country after the referendum to be ruled by a government that they elect directly.\nThe UN, the African Union, the European Union and nations individually must act to ensure that Morocco no longer precludes the referendum on self-determination for the Saharawi people from taking place.\nThe Saharawi people must be allowed to determine their own future through a free and fair UN sponsored referendum.",

    "text": "Java might be the grandaddy of them all, but there are new kids on the block. Let's see what makes Scala and Kotlin great, frustrating, and how they compare to Java.\nSince the arrival and maturity of Kotlin, JVM-based languages face quite a challenge, most particularly Scala. You must have heard a lot about Kotlin by now, especially the perks and treats it brings to the Java table. But then there is Scala, a powerful and concise Java alternative. Scala vs Kotlin? Which one is better? Or maybe it's Kotlin vs. Java or Java vs. Scala?\nScala and Kotlin aim to better Java in their own different ways.\nTo those of you planning to shift from Java to either Kotlin or Scala (can't imagine it the other way around), I am going to paint a \"what's what\" scenario so you can decide better for yourself.\nLet's look at Kotlin first.\nKotlin was developed by JetBrains and reached the market in Feb. 2012 as an open source language. Up until now, Kotlin has had two released versions, with Kotlin 1.2 being the most stable version, released Nov. 28, 2017.\nThe language grew in popularity on Android because of its perfect compatibility with Java 6, which is mainly the present version of Java on Android. Not just that, Kotlin offers some features that are only in Java 8, and are thus not available to Android developers on Java 6.\nIn the closet full of 'All that is good about Kotlin,' the two most prominent qualities of Kotlin entail seamless and flawless interoperability with Java. You can call Java code from Kotlin and vice versa without any hiccups or frowns, not to mention the in-built null safety feature. Not seeing a NullPointerException is every Android programmer\u2019s dream.\nAndroid app development is completely transformed into a blissful, non-NPE experience. If you want some detail as to how the null safety works, check it out here.\nThat is also one of the 'why's' for Google adopting Kotlin on Android as an officially supported language.\nApart from that, take a look at some of the strengths Kotlin has to offer.\nAny Java competitor has to be an FP language. Kotlin lacks a little on the higher-kinded types and type safety, but nonetheless, it offers all the features of an OOP style language with an FP approach.\nThis is my favorite part. Java is great, but the boilerplate code it makes you write is just frustrating and error-prone. Coding in Kotlin is very short, concise, and to the point. Get the job done with fewer lines of code than in Java. The less you have to write, the less often you make errors and expose yourself to bugs. Everyone knows that, right?\nOne way Kotlin reduces the amount of code is by limiting the use of findViewById.\nKotlin allows views to be accessed from the layout XML, just like you would properties. Instead of using findViewById every time, all you have to do is follow this example.\nAlthough Kotlin is a younger language than Scala, it has the support of two great companies: the formidable Google and the amazing JetBrains, who are responsible for many other IDEs, including the IntelliJ IDE for Android. So there is no doubt about great tooling support there. To all the people who thought of Kotlin as some trend, you could not be more wrong.\nKotlin is already on Android and it is definitely here to stay, grow, and evolve.\nBut with strength comes some weakness as well.\nPattern matching is not strong in Kotlin. It doesn\u2019t fully support it.\n...that would be a no. But it's no frowner. You can still do a pretty fine pattern matching job by intelligently using the when clause. But we all know that intelligence takes a little more effort and skills than your average Joe.\nIf your applications are already long, then the extra runtime size of 800KB could be a problem for you. You might experience a dwindling number of downloads because of the bigger size of an application.\nNothing is ever all good. With the concise approach Kotlin offers, there is a little problem. With so much going on in so little code, it becomes a little hard to read and understand at first. It might even feel overwhelming to a beginner.\nAlthough Google has joined hands with JetBrains to offer support for Kotlin, it is pivotal to know that Google does not endorse it. Even when you use Kotlin in Android, the autocorrect occurs slower than it does for Java.\nAs I already mentioned, Kotlin is younger than Scala and, needless to say, Java.\nSince Kotlin is younger than Scala, it has fewer libraries, blog posts, and tutorials.\nThe online support community is quite small. The lack of blog posts, tutorials, and user documentation might become a problem for you, but as trends suggest, this might be filled up soon as more and more people and companies are adopting Kotlin.\nBefore you make up your mind, let's hop over to Scala.\nScala surfaced to the general public in the year 2004. Developed by Martin Odersky, Scala was released on the Java platform as a general-purpose programming language. The name Scala is not some whimsical notion, it is an abbreviation of \"scalable\": a language that is scalable according to the needs of its users.\nBeing released in 2004 sure gave Scala the advantage of maturing more over time and taking the spotlight from Kotlin.\nScala has some common features with Kotlin like conciseness of code, higher-order functions, FP functionality with an OOP style, and interoperability with Java (though not as good as Kotlin). Other than that, here is what Scala is about.\nPattern matching in Scala is no joke. Scala uses the match statement for this purpose, which is a powerful version of Java's switch statement. It allows you to match on any type of data, lists, and even your own types. If you haven't already tried it, I suggest you play around with it a little.\nScala is a little complex, but it has a very flexible code syntax. The proficient use of functional programming features makes the code extensible and hierarchical to the very best level.\nScala has been here for more than a decade. Since it is a powerful Java alternative, it has huge support community. We're talking about YouTube tutorials, blog posts, forums, and let's not forget the official support and user documentation. Anything you find yourself struggling with, you can pretty much find the answer to it.\nScala does not restrict you from overloading operators. You can play with operator-looking functions and define limitlessly. But you need to be careful with this feature. Still, if you can do this right, your code readability will increase. If not, you might end up making your code difficult to understand.\nEverything is about speed in the world of coding. A slow program is a big turn-off. When it comes to industry-grade projects, Scala's compile time turns into minutes as compared to Kotlin, which tries to compile as fast as Java, which is in seconds.\nScala is not binary compatible with a few versions. Let's say you compiled with Scala 2.1. The same will not compile with Scala 2.11.\nThat could be nothing, or it could be your biggest nightmare if you have to work across different versions and update them. Especially if you have production-scale projects.\nScala attempts a good take on managing null safety, but it's just not as effective. The Scala equivalent for null safety is the Option keyword. Using this, there is a considerable chance you might get an NPE at the back door.\nScala and Kotlin are in quite a tug of war. Scala has the edge over Kotlin in some ways, but Kotlin is just as formidable in others. The main differences \u2014 where the two languages set themselves apart \u2014 is that Kotlin is more like a better version of Java, while Scala is an entirely different kind of Java, so to speak.\nWhile Scala has a bit of a learning curve, it offers unparalleled support for advanced functional programming. Kotlin, on the other hand, is super easy to learn and fun to code in.\nBut does that mean something is wrong with Java? I mean why change from Java in the first place?\nJava is old. Really old. Like, great-grandpa old. And while popular, its popularity actually works against it. Java use is everywhere, which makes it impossible for teams using Java to change their fundamentals, even knowing that Java is facing a lot of technical criticism as well.\nNo matter the greatness, Java has too much redundancy and lengthy boilerplate code. Kotlin and Scala just happen to be better at what Java was intended for.\nChoosing the language primarily depends on the use you need it for. Scala is a good fit for projects with a need for a mix of functional and OOP style programming languages. For places where you need to handle large amounts of data or complex modeling reliant on mathematics, Scala would be best.\nHowever, if you just wanted Java to be less frustrating \u2014 but still be Java \u2014 then there is nothing better than Kotlin out there. Using Kotlin for Android app development will be the best thing that ever happened to you. Kotlin is like a Java cousin with better looks and who doesn\u2019t talk gibberish. So choose wisely and may the code-Force be with you.",

    "text": "1. Why choose shutters? Shutters bring style & sophistication to any window & are equally at home in both traditional & modern interiors. They last longer than curtains, as fabrics begin to break down as soon as they are exposed to sunlight, require periodic washing & harbour dust mites. Shutters offer a level of light control unmatched by any blind, as the louvres within each panel can be independently adjusted to temper the degree of light entering the room. If the sun is in your eye, you can simply close the louvres on one panel & let the light flood into the room though the others. On dark days, the panels can be folded back to expose the window & maximise the light.\n2. Why choose Made for Shade? We're the Midlands' longest established, most trusted shutter company & have been fitting shutters since 1999, so we know shutters inside out. Experience has taught us that clients generally want three things - the best product, at the best price, with the best service. (John Ruskin famously said that this combination was not achievable & that one of the three had to give - We prove otherwise!). Additionally, for your added peace of mind, we're full members of the Guild of Master Craftsmen (membership number A121256) - your guarantee of a top-quality product & installation.\n3. How does the quality of your shutters compare to that of your competitors? Our shutters are manufactured by the world-leader in shutter production, utilising a combination of state of the art manufacturing & hand-crafted finishing touches. The wood used for our hardwood shutters is stored for six months before kiln drying to allow the wood to settle before being treated. UNLIKE the majority of shutter manufacturers our wood is kiln dried twice in a computer controlled drying facility. The wood is specifically dried to take into account the climate of the country to which the shutters will be exported. This is very important as these shutters are manufactured for installation in climates as varied as Alaska & Australia. By utilising these methods, frame warping is greatly reduced. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we engineer our stiles (the vertical, side bars of the shutter panels), rather than producing these as solid profiles. We cut the wood into strips which are then bonded back together in opposing layers for greater strength. This has the effect of breaking the capillaries that run through the wood, through which moisture travels. This, together with the strength of the bonding agent, ensures our panels are unlikely to warp & will give customers years of enjoyment. UNLIKE many other manufacturers we use mortise & tenon joints between the cross rails and the side stiles. These are far stronger than dowel joints & minimise movement between profiles. Movement can result in cracking of the paint or stain finish, which will spoil the aesthetic appearance of the shutters. Again, just in case there is some movement, we engineer the panels with an additional grooved overlap that ensures any movement is handled by this expansion joint. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we use a high quality, proprietary paint system developed specifically for our shutters. Cheaper shutters use cheaper paints & stains and have fewer coats. We apply six coats of paint or stain, the final layer of which is a clear lacquer with a UV additive to ensure that the shutters are less susceptible to fading and yellowing. UNLIKE other manufacturers we don't compromise on the thickness of our louvres as we believe thinner louvres, although less costly to produce, are much more susceptible to warping. UNLIKE other manufacturers, we use the best quality, marine-grade stainless steel staples to attach our tilt rods to our shutters. In addition, the tips of the staples are coated in a bonding agent to make sure they remain secure for years to come. UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we supply our shutters with a large choice of frames rather than attaching them to battens. Not only does this give you the choice of framing your window by selecting a frame design to co-ordinate with your decor, but it also offers a practical solution for awkward windows (inward opening, etc). UNLIKE many other manufacturers, we assemble our shutters prior to shipping to ensure that all the components fit together perfectly. Once photographed, the shutters are disassembled & packed into custom made packaging to ensure they arrive in perfect condition. When shipping by airfreight, we double pack the shutters for additional security. All this means we are able to provide a three-year warranty on all shutters built within our published specifications. There are inferior quality shutters available on the market, but why would you pay more to get less?\n4. Which areas do you cover? We're based in Sutton Coldfield & cover the West Midlands, East Midlands, Staffordshire, Warwickshire & Herefordshire regions. We also cover the 'M1 corridor' (the area between the M1 & the M40 between London & Birmingham).\n5. Do you actually make the shutters? Like 99% of UK shutter companies, the answer is 'no'. Made for Shade is the Midlands agent for our manufacturer S:Craft (based near Winchester), who are the shutter market leaders in terms of quality, choice & product innovation. Our expertise is in designing, surveying, specifying & installing shutters, not making them. This enables us to offer a far greater choice of materials, colours, louvre widths & framing options & guarantees clients a constant timeframe from ordering to installation. That said, we have joinery workshop facilities for customising special shutters & have been regular visitors to the factory where the shutters are manufactured. This means we can talk in detail about the production process & answer any questions you may have.\n6. Who will measure & fit my shutters? Made for Shade is a family business & as such, we don't employ sales people or believe in pressure selling. We operate a he / she who surveys also fits policy whenever possible, to maintain continuity throughout the order process. Acurate dimensions will be taken at the time of the design consultation to save disturbing you further. Our aim is to make the process of buying shutters a pleasure from start to finish & our testimonials certainly bare this out as you may have already seen.\n7. How long do I have to wait? Standard delivery time is between six & eight weeks. Special shapes take an additional two weeks, as CAD drawings need to be created & signed off before manufacture can commence. Custom coloured shutters also take an additional two weeks. However, if you need your shutters fitted sooner, we also offer an express service, which reduces the waiting time to between three & four weeks, but naturally costs a little more.\n8. How long do they take to fit? This really depends upon the size & quantity of the shutters & what they're being fitted to (wooden window frames are quicker to fit to than plastered reveals), however most jobs are completed within half a day. Naturally, we can give you an accurate time frame before you place your order.\n9. How are they fitted? All Made for Shade shutters are fitted using a three-sided or four-sided perimeter frame, from which the panels are then hinged. Frames can be fitted inside the recess, outside the recess or around the front edge of the recess, depending on how & where you want your panels to fold when open. Needless to say, there are different frame profiles for every eventuality. (The latter option is perfect for uneven recesses, as the run-out is hidden behind the frame moulding). Whichever framing option you choose, all screw-heads will be either hidden with insert strips or cap covers & in the case of stained finishes, screws will be fitted using brass or silver mounting cups. For wider installations such as patio doors & room dividers, tracking systems are used as they give constant support to the panels as they move. All panels are fitted within their frames using hinges with removable pins, which are perfect when it comes to decorating, as the panels can be simply removed & re-fitted in a matter of minutes.\n10. How & when do I pay? Payment is made in two parts, 50% when the order is placed & the remaining 50% on completion of installation. Payment can be made by cash, cheque, debit card or credit card (all major cards accepted).\n11. What are shutters made from? Made for Shade offer seven different shutter materials. The most economical option is Craftwood, which is a Polymer coated MDF product available in the six best selling white / cream shades & comes in a choice of four louvre widths. It's perfect for small to average sized installations & looked just like a wooden, painted shutter when fitted. We then have a variety of real timbers including Larchwood, Basswood & Cedarwood, each of which have their own unique grain patterns & characteristics. Using lighter weight timbers allows us to hinge more panels together to achieve greater widths with a single, conventional bi-folding shutter. Real timbers can have painted or stained finishes, but our Western Red Cedarwood can also be oiled to give it a beautifully natural finish, which brings out the individually different grain structure in each profile to give a truly rustic charm.\n12. How much light do they cut out? There are no technical figures to quote here but we estimate that a shutter will cut out 90 - 95% of incoming light. Whilst there are no gaps to let in direct light, there will always be light glow around the edges of the panels, between the louvres & between the louvre edges where they meet the stile uprights. If actual blackout is required for bedrooms, we have the perfect solution whereby a cellular pleated blackout blind is built into the shutter frame & positioned behind the panels. The blind is raised / lowered by a simple cord mechanism & cannot be seen through the panels. The blinds are available in several, equally effective colours, the most popular being white.\n13. Can they be fitted to any window? It's a rare day when we come across a window to which we can't fit shutters, but \"never say never\" as the saying goes. We need to ensure that the shutter will not inhibit the opening operation of the window & that we have suitably substantial fixing points to bare the weight, but this is all taken care of during the survey.\n14. What if my window is out of square? This is usually no problem as most windows vary in width & height across the window. If you want your shutters fitted inside the recess, the tolerance gap between the outside edge of the shutter frame & the recess itself, will usually be filled with decorating caulk as this can be painted to match the walls or window frame when dry. It takes approximately half an hour to caulk an average sizes shutter to a high standard, but makes all the difference in the world to the final result. If the window it drastically out of square, we would fill the gaps by scribing insert strips (finished in the same colour as the shutters) to the desired shape & then caulking around them as described earlier. Alternatively, we have framing options which can either be surface mounted outside the recess or fitted to the front edge of the recess with a lip feature that disguises / hides the recess variance. It's simply a case of using the right frame for the right job, which is where our expertise comes into play.\n15. What about shaped windows? No problem. We design & fit round shutters, arched shutters & angled shutters in various materials with either painted or stained finishes. The great thing about shaped shutters is that unlike blinds or curtains, they maintain the true shape of the window rather than \"squaring it off\" & the panels will still hinge open to give access to the window.\n16. What about high-level windows? If shutters are fitted to an out-of-reach window, the tilting of the louvers can be done by remote control (both battery & solar powered units are available). Alternatively, if the shutter is simply to dress the window, the louvers can be simply set in the desired position & left.\n17. How do I clean them? The easiest way is with either a feather duster or using a vacuum upholstery brush (the one with the bristles on). Marks can be removed using a damp cloth with, if necessary, a suitable soap solution.\n18. What if they get damaged? We offer a full repair service whereby, for example, damaged louvers can simply be removed & replaced with new ones.\n19. Does fitting make a mess? This depends on what we're fitting to as drilling into plaster / brick creates dust which drilling into wood doesn't. Whatever the case, we will always dust sheet the fitting area first & clean up thoroughly when we've finished. Installers also wear slippers in carpeted rooms. We are always mindful that we are in your home. We therefore treat your home as we would our own, with respect.\n20. What's the most popular colour? About 75% of our orders are for a white painted finished & there are good reasons for this. (1) White reflects light in a way no other colour will. This means light within the room is maximised as it reflects off the louvres (tip ~ using the medium 64mm or larger 89mm wide louvres also creates more light as the gaps between each louvre increase with louvre size & larger louvre surfaces reflect more light. Food for thought if you have a North facing room with a big tree outside!) (2) White never dates & always looks fresh. (3) White offers endless colour possibilities when it's time to decorate, as white will work with any colour. (4) White will always be relevant as there will always be something else white in the room (window frames, doors, radiators, coving, ceilings, etc). (5) Shutters are an investment in your home & will appeal to prospective, aspirational home buyers if you decide to move on. Buyers can always visualise working their design schemes around white shutters, as it gives them an open book decoratively speaking in addition to the wow factor.\n21. Are they guaranteed? Absolutely! All Made for Shade shutters are guarantee for a minimum of 3 years. This includes all aspect of the shutters (colour fastness & joinery) as well as the installation itself.\n22. Are they suitable for bathrooms & swimming pool areas? This really depends on the level of moisture within the air. In a large, well-ventilated bathroom with no shower, a conventional painted or stain finished shutter will be fine. However, in high moisture rooms such as shower rooms, wet-rooms & swimming pools, we have a purpose made waterproof product called Permawood, which an ABS coated hardwood. Permawood shutters are fitted with marine-grade stainless steel hinges to resist moisture & prevent rusting.\n23. How do I measure? To obtain an initial estimate, firstly decide whether you want your shutters to be fitted inside of outside the recess. Remember if they're fitted inside the recess, the panels will only fold back as far as the recess returns will allow (usually 90 degrees). If they're fitted outside the recess, the panels will fold back onto the walls (provided there is sufficient space for them to do so of course). For inside recess shutters, measure the width & drop in 3 places & tell us the largest dimension in each case. For outside recess shutters, take the same measurements & add 150mm to the recess width to allow for the overlap. If your window has a sill, add 75mm to the recess height or 150mm if it doesn't have a sill, to allow for the overlap. If you're looking to buy Caf\u00e9 Style shutters (to cover the lower part of the window only), take the width dimension in the same way, but then measure from the sill up to where you'd like the top of the shutters to be. For inside recess shutters or outside recess shutters where the window has a sill, that's the height you need to give. For outside recess, Caf\u00e9 Style shutters where the window has no sill, add 75mm to the recorded height. Naturally, we will take accurate dimensions at the point of survey but following this procedure will ensure there are no nasty surprises price-wise!\n24. What are \"Solid\" shutters? These are simply shutters, which have solid panels rather than louvred panels. They were originally fitted into period homes, folding back into purpose made side-recesses when the owners were in residence. When the owners were overseas, the shutters were closed for privacy & security as part of the \"closing up\" of the house. These days, we tend to only install solid shutters when either a greater degree of darkness is required or when replacing original solid shutters in period properties. Naturally, the amount of light entering the room can't be adjusted in the way it can with louvred shutters.\n25. Can I measure & fit my own shutters? Yes. We can measure & fit your shutters for you, we can measure but you can fit or you can measure & fit yourself. It really comes down to the complexity of the particular job & the surface to which the shutters will be fixed. If you're self-measuring, we suggest you e-mail a photograph of the window prior to finalising your order so we can try to spot any potential problems & help you overcome them.\n26. Do operate a 'price promise' pledge? Whilst our aim is to provide shutters at the most competitive price & we constantly monitor the market to check price levels, there may be times when, due to a limited or special promotion, a competitor's price is lower. In such an eventuality, we guarantee to price match any like-for-like, written quotation.\nIf you have a question other than those above, please either call us on 0121-352-0747 or e-mail it to us via our contact page & we'll answer your question by return.",

    "text": "Traditionally, quantum theory has been viewed as a \"difficult\" topic, mainly because of the symbolic-mathematical content. For example, Francl notes that two semesters of calculus is usually required for physical chemistry (1), and this is certainly true for quantum theory. The traditional approach emphases the use of mathematical equations, derivations and calculations. How do we deal with non-chemistry majors who have a weak background in mathematics, but wish to study p-chem? Similarly, how do we deal with chemistry majors who have a weak background in mathematics?\nInterestingly, the last 20-30 years has witnessed a paradigm shift in the practice of quantum chemistry. Leading up to the 1970s, quantum chemistry was monopolized by theoretical chemists, who were as much mathematicians as chemists. One had to be conversant with the mathematical methodology in order to perform a quantum calculation. More recently, the amazing increases in computing power have lead to graphical user interfaces, which has enabled a new group ofcomputational chemists. These computational chemists are interested only in the significance of the computed results, not in the details of the mathematical methods used. However, the same paradigm shift in the teaching of quantum chemistry has not occurred yet: students are still required to be competent mathematicians.\nThe \"new calculus\" in mathematics education (eg, 2) advocates the \"rule of four\" (numerical, graphical, symbolic and verbal descriptions) to deepen students' conceptual understanding (eg, 3). This \"new calculus\" acknowledges that a predominantly symbolic approach to mathematics is suitable for some, but not all, students. The greater emphasis on graphical and verbal descriptions of a \"problem\" enables students to focus on the qualitative results. The numerical approach can refer either to approximate numerical solutions (cf modern computational chemistry software) or to specific numerical examples of more general symbolic equations.\nThis paper describes the use of spreadsheets to generate approximate numerical solutions and visual (graphical) descriptions as a method of avoiding or minimizing symbolic manipulations, mathematical derivations and numerical computation. The aim here is to teach the qualitative results that arise from quantum theory, but with less \"math\". The specific example of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation and some aspects of the educational pedagogy of spreadsheet usage are discussed.\nElectrons (and atoms?) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.\nStudents are usually first introduced to quantum theory through the wavefunctions for the 1-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Exact solutions are derived for the particle-in-a-box (the Kuhn model (4)) and the simple harmonic oscillator model. The shapes of the potentials for these models are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Potential functions for the particle-in-a-box model (left) and the simple harmonic oscillator model (right).\nwhere Hn(x) is the Hermite polynomial of order n. The novice learner sees the differences between Equation 1 and Equation 2 and concludes that every potential is treated as a special case!\nPotentials such has the triangular and stepped-valley models, shown in Figure 2, have no closed-form (ie analytic) wavefunction solutions. Similarly, the quantized energies cannot be given by any analytic equation. Here, the novice learner concludes incorrectly either that quantum mechanics does not apply, or that many systems are not quantized!\nFigure 2. Simple piecewise-continuous potential functions for which the wavefunction does not have any closed form: a triangular potential (left) and a stepped-valley potential (right).\nIn p-chem classes at Deakin University, the derivative is explained as the \"slope of a function\". The 2nd order differential Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron-in-a-box (the Kuhn model (4)) is explained as \"finding the slope of a slope\". The 1st order Euler method for generating numerical solutions is explained. No calculus is required as the Euler method can be derived from the definition of average slope. More-able students can construct an appropriate spreadsheet (to find numerical solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), but mostly, spreadsheet quantum_well.xls<http://www.deakin.edu.au/~lim/KFLim/papers/2003_Spreadsheet_CCEN/quantum_well.xls>, implementing the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is provided as a \"black box\" to weaker students. (The pros and cons of black box methods are discussed below.) Using the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, students test how the shape of a trial \"wavefunction\" changes as the energy is varied (Figure 3). A copy of the instructions to students for this exercise can be found at<http://www.deakin.edu.au/~lim/KFLim/papers/2003_Spreadsheet_CCEN/Asgnt_1_6.pdf>. The wavefunction solutions are classed as \"valid\" or \"invalid\" depending on whether the boundary conditions are satisfied as energy is varied (the shooting method (6)).\nFigure 3. Approximate trial wavefunctions for the triangular potential (Figure 2), arranged from high energy (top) to low energy (bottom). Shaded domains are the forbidden region: V(x) < E.\nStudents discover that energy determines the wavelength of the wavefunction, and that valid solutions require that only special (\"allowed\") wavelengths will fit the dimension of the potential (Figure 3). It is observed that, as wavelength decreases, the number of nodes (the zeroes or roots of the wavefunction) increases with energy. An extension of this exercise using a skipping rope easily verifies that it is more difficult (higher energy) to swing the rope with nodes present than without any nodes (lower energy). Since the sign of the wavefunction changes across a node, the qualitative shape of the wavefunction can be generated from the nodal pattern. (One strategy in de Bono's Lateral Thinking (7) is to concentrate on what is not present - ie the nodes or zeroes - in order to obtain what should be present - the wavefunction.) Wavefunctions can then be generated from nodal patterns in 2-dimensions and 3-dimensions.\nFor example, the molecular orbitals for cyclopentadienyl have, in increasing order of energy, no nodes, one node and two nodes respectively (Figure 4). Similarly, the rotational wavefunctions can be generated by considering nodal patterns on the surface of a sphere. Much of Schr\u00f6dinger's original work was based on Hamilton's mathematical description of standing waves on a planet completely covered by ocean (ie water waves on a spherical surface). Note that these \"spherical waves\" correspond to combinations of the spherical harmonic functions, and can be obtained from the symmetry - \"topology\" - of the nodal patterns on the surface of a sphere.\nFigure 4. molecular orbitals for cyclopentadienyl. Shading of the circles in the centre panels represent the sign (direction) of the pz orbitals. The pzorbitals change sign across nodal planes, which are shown as blue lines.\nOn further exploration with the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, students discover that the shapes of the allowed one-dimensional wavefunctions are similar (Figure 5), even for different potential models: ie, the lowest-energy wavefunctions all have one \"bump\", with no nodes.\nFigure 5. Lowest-energy approximate wavefunctions for the particle-in-a-box (top panel), simple harmonic oscillator (2nd panel), triangular (3rd panel) and stepped-valley (bottom panel) potentials of Figure 1 andFigure 2. Shaded domains are the forbidden region: V(x) < E.\nthe use of a series of square wells separated by barriers (extended Kronig-Penney model) illustrates that interactions between wells split energy levels. As the number of wells increases, the (single-well) energy splits into a quasi-continuous band of energies, giving rise to the band theory for conductors and semi-conductors.\nAlthough there has been a substantial history in the use of spreadsheet and graphical applications in education (eg 9,10), the author believes that full utilization of the technology, especially in chemical education, has not been realized.\nThe aim of this paper is to teach the qualitative results that arise from applying mathematics to physical and chemical systems, but without the mathematical rigor: \"teaching maths with minimal maths\". The \"new calculus\" advocates the \"rule of four\" (numerical, graphical, symbolic and verbal descriptions) to deepen students' conceptual understanding (2). Students who have a weak background in mathematics do not have the knowledge of calculus required for the usual symbolic algebra approach to physical chemistry. This case study illustrates how a combination of numerical, graphical and verbal descriptions can be used to overcome the lack of symbolic knowledge or ability.\nThe Logical-Mathematical intelligence is only one of multiple \"intelligences\" (11). By changing the emphasis away from mathematical calculus, the numerical-experimental activity, can also cater to those students who favor Spatial or Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligences. A combination of this spreadsheet approach with the traditional calculus-based approach will enable more students (and students of more types of \"intelligences\") to study quantum theory.\nThis paper has focused on the use of spreadsheets but, in principle, the simulations can be done using symbolic mathematical packages such as Mathematica, Maple or MathCAD. This would only be feasible for students who already have a strong mathematical background. This author prefers the use of spreadsheets for weaker students for the following reasons. The symbolic mathematical packages depend on the use of a symbolic, quasi-programming language, which can present an additional learning obstacle for many students (12). Furthermore, the access to symbolic mathematical packages is usually more limited than that of spreadsheets, which are widely available in home, business and community settings. The \"worldware\" (13,14) (also called \"application-software\" (15)) nature of spreadsheets means that students will have greater opportunities to use and become familiar with spreadsheets than with (eg) symbolic mathematical packages, leading to greater utility and expertise: Software that isn't designed for instruction can still be good for learning (13). (A \"straw poll\" of physical chemistry faculty suggests that significantly more faculty use spreadsheets in teaching and learning activities than symbolic mathematical packages (16).\nWhile weaker students will use the spreadsheets, discussed in this paper, as \"black boxes\", more able students can construct similar, appropriate spreadsheets (eg17-19). Instructors will need to be careful in deciding to use the \"black box\" approach or to require students construct their own. If successfully completed, the latter approach will promote deeper learning (19), but the greater complexity of the task (12) may mean that some students cannot complete the task, resulting in frustration and lack of learning.\nThe key feature of using spreadsheets is that students do \"numerical experiments\". (There is an interesting discussion of the use of numerical experiments in (20-22). Numerical experiments (eg 23) were also a key part of the development of chaos theory (20).) By playing with \"what-if\" scenarios, students can test the validity of their concepts and ideas: the success of using spreadsheets in this way is supported by cognitive constructivist models of learning (15,24,25). The use of spreadsheets is intended to give students a qualitative appreciation of quantum theory, and does not serve as a pre-requisite to more advanced studies in quantum theory, for which a reasonable knowledge of mathematics is required.\nThis paper is an expanded version of case studies to be published by LTSN Maths, Stats & OR Network <http://ltsn.mathstore.ac.uk/mathsteam> and by LTSN Physical Sciences <http://www.physsci.ltsn.ac.uk>.\nKFL thanks Ms Jeanne Lee ( ) (Australian Catholic University) for encouraging and helpful discussions, Dr Paul Yates<http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/ch/staff/pcy/pcy.html> (Keele University, UK) for suggestions to improve the spreadsheet quantum_well.xls, and Associate Professor (Emeritus) Ian Johnston <http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/johnston.html> (Uniserve\u00b7Science, University of Sydney, Australia) <http://www.usyd.edu.au/su/SCH/> for a seminar on MUPPET (the Maryland University Project in Physics and Educational Technology) <http://www.physics.umd.edu/rgroups/ripe/computer.html> which introduced KFL to the possibilities of numerical experiments in teaching and learning.\nAll URLs checked on 7 March 2003.\nFrancl, M., Survival Guide for Physical Chemistry; Physics Curriculum and Instruction: Lakeville (MN), 2001.\nPreparing for a New Calculus; Solow, A.

    "text": "My father in law Charlie was prescribed Clopidogrel on May 2, 2014.\nHe was in turn taken to Pittsburgh hospital in July 30, 2014 with bleeding on the brain, as diagnosed by a neurosurgeon. The doctor placed him in hospice because he could not fix the issue. Charlie died on February 13, 2015. The cause of death listed on his death certificate is subdural hemorrhage.\nThe only lawsuits I have seen relating to this issue are for Plavix, not Clopidogrel which is the generic brand. Are there any lawyers taking Clopidogrel lawsuits? What would I have to do to bring a case for this? Thank you.\nClopidogrel bisulfate, or its generic brand name Plavix, is manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The drug was approved in 1997 for prevention of blood clots and to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\nWhile the manufacturer claimed Plavix worked better than aspirin, recent studies have shown that Plavix carries no significant benefit over the much cheaper aspirin.\nThere are currently several class actions in litigation. It appears they are not accepting victims in class actions against Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate.\nGo online and search on class actions for Clopidogrel bisulfate. You will find a good number of law firms representing victims of the side effects of Clopidogrel bisulfate in class actions and product liability claims. Feel free to contact those firms for further information.\nMy father passed away June 2016. A TIA incident brought us to our nearest hospital. There, the nurse recommended Plavix. Not even three months later he had a massive brain hemorrhage. He died from plavix being in his system before he passed away a week later.\nI read that if he took aspirin with it, which I believe he did for the headache, it increases the chance of bleeding even further. They never went over that, at least not with me in the room.\nThis stuff really shouldn\u2019t be on the market, it does not help anyone no mater how great the thought is. It\u2019s only a great way to kill your family. Hospitals have Total lack of understanding of the use of this drug. Do not take this stuff lightly.\nI don\u2019t know if I can sue them and the hospital since its been two/three years, but if its possible I will. Even if it doesn\u2019t bring back my dad. I want to fight them so at least he wouldn\u2019t have died in vain, for my family and for others.\nI had a heart attack in April 2017 and was put on a generic of Plavix. I was supposed to take it for a whole year but 2 months ago I got a letter in the mail stating the generic for Plavix (the pill I was taking) was on recall. Now I am looking for a lawyer to tell me what I should do because the whole time I was taking this medicine it wasn\u2019t helping me. I\u2019m still having trouble breathing and I have this rash all over my body. I don\u2019t know what to do but I\u2019m about to contact a lawyer.\nI am so sorry about your husband\u2019s death. Thank you very much for giving out this very important information about \u2018the court ruling\u2019. Only after I read your write up I understood why, not a single law firm is willing to go after these drug manufactures, and why they are dropping the cases.\nWith all the death and side effect incidents with this drug, FDA is claiming that \u2018enough\u2019 victims or doctors are not reporting the adverse effect to FDA so they could not recall it! The \u2018number of victims\u2019 report is their base for recall! Did you get a chance to report it to FDA? You could do it online FDA.GOV. Or call 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332) and speak to a person.\nMy husband was bruising all over his body, cardiologists said that is the side effect of clopidogrel and got a bleeding stroke in April of 2016, followed by seizures and complications from that. Fortunately, he is still alive, could not drive, quality of life completely changed, 72 year old need to be taken care of like a seven year old. Now that FDA has the authority over this drug, there is something we could do, thus our loss will not be in vein.\nWe need to write to the FDA administrator, with cc to the white house, the justice department who did the ruling, the house appropriation committee chair who is funding the FDA, the senators and the congressmen/women of our states. There are a lot of victims not able to do anything about it legally, however, collectively we could do a lot about it. If I could save one family from going through the suffering, I will be happy. Please communicate with me if you could.\nMy husband died as a result of taking Plavix following a TIA he had in January of 2012. For 6 months he took Plavix and when it came off patent in May, 2012 he was given the generic called Clopidogrel for 3 more years.\nMany of the side effects of Plavix, or the generic drug, presented in my husband, but were attributed to his existing disease, NASH \u2013 nonalcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.\nDuring the time he was on this medication he had nose bleeds, bleeding in his mouth, and constant bruising. When he had a cerebral hemorrhage and a gastro-intestinal bleed, doctors could not figure out what was happening.\nAfter his death in December of 2015, I proceeded to do some research on my own. Major side effects from these drugs are cerebral hemorrhages, gastro-intestinal bleeds, nose bleeds, gum bleeds, blood bruising and bone marrow disorder.\nIt was this last side effect that ultimately killed my husband. He developed a bone marrow disorder which led to AML leukemia. He died from this leukemia.\nIn my research I have read so many accounts of people who had been prescribed Plavix and were later diagnosed with AML leukemia. Obviously, not a coincidence. It would appear to be a direct result of taking these drugs.\nDue to the ruling by the Supreme Court Justices which stated that all generic drugs and their manufacturers, some 80% of all drugs consumed in the United States, are exempt from liability for side effects, mislabeling, or virtually any other negative reactions caused by their drugs.\nIn short, the Court ruled that the FDA has ultimate authority over pharmaceuticals in the US, and if the FDA says a drug is safe, that takes precedent over actual facts, real victims and any and all adverse reactions.\nIn other words, if the FDA says something is safe, it does not matter if that decision is wrong or the result of misrepresentation, fraud or deception on the part of the world\u2019s pharmaceutical companies.\nThere is no way to sue the FDA for being wrong and costing millions of unsuspecting Americans their lives. That result leaves millions of Americans unprotected from an industry responsible for innumerable preventable deaths in the US from use of these drugs and their side effects.\nMy husband died and there is no recourse. However, if he was holding a hot cup of coffee from McDonald\u2019s, we could have litigated this!\nPharmaceutical companies and our government, in the eyes of the Supreme Court, are putting profits before people. This decision has to be reversed.",

    "text": "The Kearny Mesa Swimming Pool is now much more inviting for disabled visitors.\nCrews striped extra-wide parking spots to accommodate vans for the disabled, and a ramp was added for those who can\u2019t climb the stairs.\nLocker rooms have been gutted to widen restroom, shower and dressing stalls for wheelchair users. The outdoor shower area has been rebuilt to eliminate a step, and easy-to-turn handles will be installed on doors.\nThroughout San Diego, a growing number of public buildings and streets are getting retrofitted as the city steps up spending to tackle a backlog of projects to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSan Diego used to spend about $1.5 million a year on such projects. Now it\u2019s spending $10 million more per year on curb cuts, ramps, audible signals and detectable warning tiles at street intersections, among other improvements to remove barriers to access.\nMayor Jerry Sanders has committed to spending the additional $50 million over five years to improve access, in part by allocating proceeds from the sales of surplus city properties.\n\u201cBefore the mayor came into the office, we were just doing a trickle of projects. We are doing a lot of projects now,\u201d said David Jarrell, deputy chief operating officer for public works.\nAdvocates for the disabled said the improvements would help cut down the city\u2019s liability. Cities across the country have been sued for failure to improve access. San Diego was sued in 1997 by disabled residents who claimed they had been denied equal access to Qualcomm Stadium. The lawsuit was settled after the city agreed to spend $5.25 million to equip the stadium with new elevators, ramps, parking spaces and seating.\nBill Harris, a Sanders\u2019 spokesman, said the desire to do the right thing \u2013 not legal exposure \u2013 drove the mayor\u2019s commitment to ADA compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about avoiding litigation. It\u2019s about ensuring equal access,\u201d Harris said.\nAccording to the city, more than 500 curb ramps were installed in the past two years. About $19 million of projects are in design stages and an additional $4 million in jobs are under construction.\nFacilities being retrofitted range from police stations and recreation centers to branch libraries and teen centers.\nCindi Jones, director of the Center for an Accessible Society in San Diego, said improvements have been made, but the city still has a long way to go. She uses a scooter and her husband uses a wheelchair.\nIn South Park, where she and her husband have lived for 30 years, a curb cut was installed on their block about a year ago, Jones noted. She\u2019s looking forward to more curb cuts in her neighborhood.\nThe city\u2019s former disability services coordinator, Linda Woodbury, had said the city needed to spend $500 million on ADA compliance, but the mayor\u2019s office has disputed that figure. Woodbury was fired in 2006, a day after Sanders first proposed spending $50 million more on access projects. The city later settled a wrongful termination suit.\nLouis Frick, executive director of Access to Independence in San Diego, said the access features benefit society as a whole.\n\u201cYou see people all the time with baby strollers, delivery truck drivers, where they are using the curb cuts to get up and down the sidewalks,\u201d he said.",

    "text": "When Cait and I found out how easy it is to make ravioli\u2013and with such completely impressive and delicious results!\u2013we just had to share this fabulous harvest recipe with you.\nThis dish is a poem to autumn, filled with sweet, tender butternut squash combined with a touch of honey, fresh thyme, rosemary, sage, and Parmesan, and topped with chopped hazelnuts (or you could substitute walnuts) and brown butter. This would work beautifully for any family feast or romantic, intimate dinner.\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Cut the squash in half through the stem and lay the halves cut side down on the oiled baking sheet. Bake 50-60 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Scoop out seeds and fibers and discard, then spoon the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash squash with a potato-masher until smooth, then add breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, honey, thyme, rosemary, chopped sage, and orange zest. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm the olive oil and nut oil over medium heat in a small frying pan and add hazelnuts or walnuts. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes, or until nuts are golden. Transfer nuts to a plate and set aside.\n3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan until it turns brown and begins to smoke, 3-4 minutes. Remove immediately from heat, add nutmeg, and set aside.\n4. Place a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Spoon mounds of filling on the sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart (the number of mounds you make will depend on the size of the pasta sheets you use). Lightly mist the mounds with a spray mister filled with water, then place a second pasta sheet over the first, covering the filling mounds, and pressing firmly around the edges and between the mounds to seal. Using a fluted cutting wheel or knife, cut between the rows of ravioli. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\n5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook until tender, 2-3 minutes. To serve, reheat the browned butter. Drain ravioli and place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with butter, sprinkle with hazelnuts and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Garnish with sage leaves and serve immediately.\nInspired by Williams-Sonoma Seasonal Celebration: Autumn, by Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, 1997).",

    "text": "There were 13,328,066 shares of the Registrant\u2019s Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on July 31, 2016.\nThe consolidated balance sheet of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) at September 30, 2015 was derived from the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were made. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nCertain amounts previously presented in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-17-Income Taxes (Topic 740) requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The purpose of this adoption was to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of this standard. The effect of the adjustment at September 30, 2015 was a $6.4 million decrease in current assets, a $10,000 decrease in current liabilities, a $3.0 million increase in non-current deferred tax assets and a $3.4 million decrease in non-current deferred tax liabilities. Such reclassification had no effect on our previously reported net loss, stockholders\u2019 equity or cash flows.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. At June 30, 2016, management reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s long-lived assets based on future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying value of certain rental assets exceeded the expected future cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016. No such impairment of remaining long-lived assets was necessary as the expected future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the assets.\nThe Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale of its manufactured rental equipment. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases of its manufactured products. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by the customer. Except for certain of the Company\u2019s reservoir characterization products, the Company\u2019s products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and the Company\u2019s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit. The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company\u2019s equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer. Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate.\nimmediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities will apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, this new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The guidance also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance was issued to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a five-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this guidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either retrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance and affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nAt June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company\u2019s Canadian subsidiary had $27.5 million and $28.1 million, respectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries. In order to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. Approximately $3.3 million of these Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable are considered by management to be of a short-term nature whereby the appreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will result in a gain or loss, respectively, to the consolidated statement of operations. The Company considers the remaining $24.2 million Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable to be of a long-term nature and whereby settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future; therefore, any resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are reported in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 830 \u201cForeign Currency Matters\u201d. In June 2016, the Company entered into a $3.0 million 90-day hedge contract with a United States bank to hedge a portion of its short-term Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure. This contract reduces the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. At June 30, 2016, the fair value of this contract was a liability of $11,000.\nequivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective balance sheet dates.\nThe Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis in evaluating potential impairment losses related to long-lived assets.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company made non-cash inventory transfers of $3.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, to its rental equipment fleet. Raw materials include semi-finished goods and component parts totaling $52.5 million and $48.4 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.\nThe Company had no long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.\nOn March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank with borrowing availability of $50.0 million (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). On May 4, 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which reduced its borrowing availability to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base. Under the amendments to the Credit Agreement, the borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company\u2019s and its U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (excluding work-in-process inventories). As of June 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s borrowing base was $35.3 million resulting in borrowing availability of $30.0 million less $0.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. The Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets. The Credit Agreement expires on May 4, 2018 and all borrowed funds are due and payable at that time. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Credit Agreement as amended limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares certain of the Company\u2019s assets to certain of its liabilities, restricts the Company and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement as amended is based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which was 3.50% at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 182,400 shares of restricted stock under its 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The weighted average grant date fair value of the restricted stock was $14.84 per share. The grant date fair value of these awards was $2.7 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards was determined based on the closing market price of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are entitled to dividends, if paid.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company also issued 69,300 nonqualified stock options under the Plan. The options issued are based upon three tiers, each with separate market and service based vesting conditions. Market based vesting conditions are based on achieving a specified market return on the Company\u2019s stock price. Compensation expense for the nonqualified stock option awards was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which incorporates the possibility that the market conditions may not be satisfied. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options issued was determined to be $5.96 per option resulting in unrecognized compensation costs of $0.4 million, which will be charged to expense over the requisite service period of the options, ranging from 18 to 36 months.\nAs of June 30, 2016, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $8.1 million relating to restricted stock awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. In addition, the Company had $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonqualified stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\nAs of June 30, 2016, a total of 276,150 shares of restricted stock and 159,000 nonqualified stock options shares were outstanding.\nFor the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, 159,000 stock options and 89,700 stock options, respectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as a result of their impact being antidilutive.\nThe Company is involved in various pending or potential legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation. Management is not aware of any material pending or known to be contemplated legal or government proceedings against the Company.\nThe Company reports and evaluates financial information for two segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic. Seismic product lines include: land and marine wireless data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products.

    "text": "There was a small town near the shores of the sea; it was a topical climate with mixture of occasional rainfall, hot summer & even pleasant atmosphere with low heat & humidity. The whole town was encircled with the backwaters of the rivers. With such a classic whether there was also a short coming which could wipe out the whole town. The tornado\u2019s quite regularly hit the surrounding towns so the impact of it would hit this small town too. Owing to the increasing trouble of these the people had started to flee from here. While there were people in towns who were the survivors of these who took shelter in this town.\nToday two different people both who were survivors of the same town moved into this new place but both were strangers & poles apart. One was calm & patient while the other was fierce & impatient but both were always inevitable & destructive in nature if meddled with, with a slight deviation, the calm one had the ability to choose either go ahead & wreck everything but the fierce person didn\u2019t had that choice once a step taken forward has to feel the burnt.\nEven if these two people\u2019s ways were different and always repulsive in nature, they both were away from their people it was a test of survival for them in this place. They had none to share what they felt, none to listen to their talks, none to see their pain hidden in their heart. But destiny could not stop itself posing them infront of each other. He, who was fire and she, who was water did face each other will they ever overcome there obstacles & blend in one another without terminating the other.\nSeeing is believing is said for the human sense sight but at this time of the day when darkness is all you could see around and light is something alien and hard to visualise what is there in front of you that doesn\u2019t mean you are lost or blind? Just like everyone my other senses come to my rescue. Exactly now when I cannot see anything through my eyes I could hear the roars of the ocean everytime it hit the banks indicating I am standing right infront of the vast expanse of the ocean. Petrichor, the scent of rain filled my lungs predicting the approaching rain, the touch of which would cease my burning but I am not ready to taste the freedom from this fire. In addition to these I know how to eradicate the darkness as I have the capacity to turn on the light even at the darkest times of life.\nThe rain can come down to the earth anytime and I have to take shelter before that but still I wait at the banks waiting for the darkness to break into dawn. This has been my routine from past week to sprint around the seashore of this sea at the darkest hour before the dawn and wait for the moment of darkness breaking into the dawn. To watch the sun to gain its position high in the sky, paint his colors over the world showing his supremacy to kill darkness of life. It is not only the sun but also me who feels that has spread my color all over the world.\nSlowly the sun made its way out of his den painting the whole sky bright redish yellow with its rays. Consuming the gloomy night and spreading the light bringing new hope & a beginning of bright fresh life. Once I had witnessed the magnificent sight of sunrise my concentration went towards my sense which had alerted about the approaching rain. But now there was no sign of it, that left me astonished as rain is one thing I just hate it and my senses have never been wrong in identifying them. Leaving that thought aside I make my way back to the hostel which has become my new home from where I will have to attend my first day of my master\u2019s classes today.\nNot before I had turned my eyes get struck to the sight of a girl in bluish white suit running away something was there about her unknown which made me watch her till she disappeared from my vision. I have been coming here from past 5 days but never did I saw any girl at this time of the hour. She did turn back once but I could not see her face. Just then I heard my cell beep reminding me of the time & I headed back still I couldn\u2019t stop myself to watch at the way she ran off.\nSome things never change every where the seniors welcoming the juniors especially in there own innovative way. I had just entered the gates of my college when a group of people naming themselves as seniors blocked my way. They were many more already in queues who were dancing as puppets of seniors. I had a strong urge to teach them a good lesson but I couldn\u2019t just barge in and destruct everything but that would only catch the attention of everyone. Now itself I can feel many eyes on me, that always annoy me.\nAgainst my wishes I simply follow there orders to stand in the queue and wait for my turn to come. Just then there was absolute silence as everyone\u2019s attention was on the entrance maybe another junior\u2019s who are trying to dorge away from these ragging session? But No. when I look at the entrance I could only see a beautiful mesmerising alluring blue eyes of the girl, they captivated me in its pools as deep as oceans that I can get lost in them. It was a picture painted in blue theme, every essence of her oozed as serene beauty. I could no longer see the world around me just her only; everything around her seems to vanish away from my view. As if in the whole world it is you and me alone, with my every breath, with my every heartbeat clearly wanting to be with you. Her earrings kissed her cheeks everytime she kept walking her bangles made sounds of waves in the ocean which was matching her light blue & white mixed dress. Is she the same one whom I saw in the beach today, looks like she is as even at that time she wored the same dress, the same gait, the same care free strides. Today I felt like I got a whole new world to live in.\nI don\u2019t know when my legs take me away from the crowd towards the object of my interest but I was pulled back by something. When I turn to see what that was I saw it was the guy next to me who pulled me back, he was saying something which I failed to hear it. I turned back my gaze to her; she was not there; I turn around everywhere only to find her in front of those seniors. I moved in a way to have clear view of her face without any interruption. Her eyes had a gleam of naughtiness which I didn\u2019t know for what.\nI felt another nudge in my hand to jolt me into the reality. It was again the same guy but now I heard him say \u201cMan, what are you doing come back and stand here, don\u2019t mess with seniors. See how these girls got them in trouble.\u201d The word Girls made me look at them again to find another girl beside her. All of them were watching her ignoring the pleasant beauty of mine. They were questioning them, that is when I got to know her name is Geet & the girl whom I just noticed her name is Pari.\nGeet, the name rang in my ears inveigling my heart with unknown bliss. Such a melodious name she has got that I could only hear and speak her name throughout the remaining life of mine. My heart was showing its presence more than ever with her first visual itself, weaving many desires which could bind me into something which I never was bound to. Thoughts are flying high freeing it self from the strings of my mind. Spirit is flowing in a direction which it had never crossed but it surged without bothering about any hindrance. Wish I could just embrace this moment in myself, to witness a new facet of the dreams. Her eyes were revealing more than she could every voice out surprising me at the things which it could conceal. I was eager to be with her which made my heart to live.\nDilon mein tum apni betabiyan leke chal rahe ho.\nMy revive was broken when the guy next to me was biting his nails in nervousness as he was worried for the girl next to Geet, as he was muttering \u201cPlease God save Pari from these ragging\u2019s\u201d but what I saw actually amazed me as that girl Pari stood fearless while my Geet stood behind her hiding herself from the situation. Such a contrary thing it was happening I was not scared for Geet as I knew she could come out the situation without any help where as the guy next to me was praying for Pari while the girls were doing just the opposite. But Geet\u2019s eyes shone bright, calm & undeterred confidence trickled in her every stir though she portrayed as fearful infront of everyone. She held on to the facade of a timid girl duping around the others. Her face can deceive everyone but her eyes couldn\u2019t as they told every story of hers. She was not a meek girl, none could scrum her into doing things against her wishes, but why does she have to do things like that.\nApparently the situation in the hand was the senior\u2019s portrayed themselves as generous enough to give us the option to whether we want to get ragged or not. Well that was not a real option though as a person would be asked to light the candle once they did it they would say since you have lighted it that means you have accepted to be ragged. So now the candle was placed in the middle of the stand and the girls were asked to light that. I was more interested to see the play as I read her eyes which had the mischievous glint in it. And just I guessed the fun started Geet\u2019s face turned was something everyone could not miss as it turned pale with fear and she clutched Pari\u2019s hand & fainted next second.\nFor a second even I got worried but then the wink confirmed all my doubts. Getting the clue Pari played along shouting \u201cGeet\u2026\u2026.what happened Geet\u2026get up\u2026 get up\u2026. Please someone get some water.\u201d After a while she stood drawing everyones attention to herself. When the seniors questioned her, the reply just shook everyone but I was just lost in that melody and couldn\u2019t stop the smile. Geet replied as a scared kitten shuttering and trying to hard to form even a word that \u201cI burnt it \u2026. I burnt it\u201d. Well ever Pari was confused so enquired \u201cwhat did you burn Geet.\u201d \u201cB\u2026..B\u2026\u2026Blub\u201d But looks like seniors were not falling for her drama as she was asked to light the candle now.\nI was now curious to know more about her plan as the naught sparkle twinkled in her eyes. She with trembling fingers tried to light the candle but stick failed to burn. Geet said \u201cIt is not burning so can I leave for the class sir.\u201d Finally not able to withstand the bugging kitten they let go of her. We will trap her someother time is what I heard a senior whisper into another senior. Her eyes showed she had won this play but that play was not only for her but for everyone there. With a confident & smiling face she left, actually she was concealling more may be she would have danced at her victory but stayed quite because of the people around her.\nAfter she left what happened was really a boon to others as none were able to light the candle with the sticks and were given a green signal to leave to class without any interruption as none of the juniors revealed that the stick had been damp. Actually what had happened was when Geet had feel on the ground the box had feel down in moist grass, which none of them saw at that time. Now the seniors were getting suspicious why none are able to light it are they acting? Then one of them noticed the wetness of the sticks. So when it was my turn they changed the rule if you light it only then you will be set free.\nI never had lost any game or battle then how could I just bow down when it was the question of lighting a candle. I made my hands covered there vision of the candle and the stick and within seconds I lit the candle without any trouble. What did they thought that this is the only stick through which the light could be generated. There are other ways to do that & winning over me is not going to happen ever. Without any further delay I dropped the match box in the nearby bin & went to the class with a stride which meant not to be stopped by anyone.\nI was joined by the guy who came running towards me while he said \u201cHey man, slow down, how did you do that\u201d. I didn\u2019t stop but started to move towards my designated class. When he came in front of me introducing himself \u201cHi, I am Yash and you are\u201d \u201cMaan\u201d was the only thing which I said and entered my class to see Geet in the same class of mine.\nAnother lecture starts from today, well that is one thing I always disliked but still I have never let the other person to feel that I am not one of the keen listener as I don\u2019t ignore them but just bear there words which some or the other time has been useful. This time I had a silver lining say it a distraction or attraction which would last for atleast a little while.\nI entered the class to witness Geet who sat at the front bench with her was Pari, looks like both are friends that they are sticking together. Class was almost full any time the classes would start as the time to start was nearing. I sat away from everyone as I was never a man who needed company.\nMy loneliness didn\u2019t last for long as it was accompanied by the slim nerd with broad forehead and wide cheek bones that narrow to a small chin with the naroow frame spectacles guy Yash I wished it was Geet beside me but this time I have to bear with this one as the guy, yes Yash was behind me and had followed me to the place where I had selected to sit. Well there was a special thing at this position and that was the view I would get, from here I could see the professors & behind the dias was a glass on which the image I could see was of the reflection of Geet.\nTime passed a person came said something and then my eyes went back to Geet who was busy in writing and then she was lost in seeing something when I glanced where she was looking at I saw some other person who stood at the podium. I wonder where the other person went but before I could ponder about that my eyes went on the pen which was just about to touch the curvy glossy lips of hers.\nConstant bugging of Yash gained my attention as he was mentioning something about some Economics, business and management I glared back at him to stop him from irritating me. As I take a quick look at the platform to witness yet another different person there. Have I started seeing things, was that a mirage or did the face of the person change like chameleon?\nI wanted to see what was happening around so I kept watching him but as the person was a lean bald guy he wasn\u2019t covering the glass behind giving me more access t0 my distraction she was time & again glancing over her lace tied around her wrist. It took a minute more to realise she was getting bored maybe that\u2019s why she was checking the time. That is when I checked the time which said 3 and half hours has been passed since I have been sitting here in this place. That means this is the 4th class of the day & I haven\u2019t heard a word from anyone.\nSuddenly Geet\u2019s face had shone and next second there was a long ring indicating the end of the first session and once the unknown professor left the room she & Pari flew from there may be they were hungry. Half n hour of break like everyone I too headed towards the canteen to check what I can get to fill my appetite. I had got one plate of food and sat away from the crowd when I saw my hearts leisure pursuit the blue girl getting her plate filled with food.\nI saw them looking at the whole canteen to check for a place just then Yash who was just behind them showed the table where I am sitting. He wanted to watch her everymove but staring like that when the other person was watching straight back at you was not manners and that too when I held the fire to consume her.\nMy eyes were unwilling to obey my order to look anywhere but her. Then somehow I managed to concentrate on the food but it was just for a second then it was back on her. Fortunately this time she was looking at something else at the other end. She was looking at that direction more intently making my inside to burn. I turned my gaze towards her vision and that enraged me again as Geet was looking at the seniors and one of them who was leading the ragging session was heading to our table. I wouldn\u2019t mind breaking his bones or even burning him to show him the glimpse of hell.\nHe was just a feet away from his table when the ground under him vanished as he lost balance and swan through the air bang his nose to the ground. He was carrying a plate of food he had picked it up on his way and all of it he had been carrying in his hand fell on his head and finally even the plate hit his head giving him the award he deserved. That\u2019s when I noticed the wet floor and the caution board kept to be careful as the floor was slippery.\nA slight giggle caught my ears out of the whole laugh going around the canteen and that was from none other than the girl who sat infront of me. She was trying very hard not to laugh as it would only instigate the others and bring us under their scanner. But even then she couldn\u2019t stop the smile that escaped against her wishes and adored her lips. The twinkle in her eyes which held the power to hypnotise even a saint.\nIt was the first time she sat so close to me and I was failing to stick to my previous decision of not to stare at her but when did the heart listen when God\u2019s such a exquisite creation was right before my eyes. She had her eyes fixed on the table I just didn\u2019t know what is so interesting out there on it while I couldn\u2019t move my gaze from her. I wished she looked up to me at least once so that I could read what she was thinking. Maybe she didn\u2019t noticed me till now as she was busy with the laugh she got to see here but before I could make that statement sink into my heart she raised her lashes to meet my molten eyes to lose the whole world around us or to find a new way together.\nChange is the only thing which is constant in life and is the same thing which I am experiencing now. My sense\u2019s which has always been active in alerting me of my surroundings has changed its allegiance. My eyes never leaves the sight of her as it only tries to find more about her while I always search to hear her melodious voice in every sound that hits my ears, I wait for the moment of slight touch of her veil every time we have bump into one another. It takes every ounce of my will to resist from tasting this forbidden fruit. She is all bent to change me as she smells like a dew drop making me to hate the thought why I hated that before.\nThe fact which I always certain about eradicating the darkness & lighting it seems to be lost with the way my life had taken a turn. My day which always used to start with the sprinting before the breaking of dawn to keep me fit and focussed has also changed. Now after sprinting I would do my exercise using fire to help me keep focus on the issue that is on the hand. Every day I try new ways with fire I would light up the edges of the stick with fire and swinging the blazing stick in different ways so as to wipe out that vision which has plastered to my eyes.\nThat day when our eyes had met, the world around me had just ceased to exist. Those deep blue eyes held me captive in her spell that I felt I wandered into a place where every thing was so serene that I didn\u2019t know whether I was lost before or am I getting lost now. I was looking deep into violet & green mixed pupils of her to find what all secrets that could unfold infront of me. But what I found was a haze image of person\u2019s face which started to disturb the tranquilly of those orbs a bit later what I saw was it was not just the disturbance but vanquishing the glow with the flame of that persons mere presence which turned into my face. That was the harsh reality of mine which broke my trance and I had left the table in a rush leaving everyone to ponder anything what they wish.\nI would now rather light up the whole place to make me remember the fact of my presence in anyones life would only harm everyone. How could I forget why I am all alone? I break one another stick that was in my hand with the rage which had only amplified the concealed fire in me. I have led lonely life because of this reason, when ever I have lost focused I have not only lost my dearest and nearest but also have felt the burnt of it my own self. How unlucky am I to even not retain a companion for even a small part of this long life. With these thoughts cruising in my mind everytime I would never know when the dawn breaks & the day starts. But with my starting ignorance with the surroundings one had not left to remind me about my college and that was Yash who used to call me with his stupid problems.\nExactly now I got a call from Yash making me realise the time as even the sun elevated high in the sky failed to be gain my attention as I was busy fight with the inner battle. I switched on the Bluetooth and without a second delay he started his cribbing.\nThat reminds me of the act of last night when I had held the light in my hand & had snapping the fingers lighting it & switching it off with my thoughts running about the past and trying to get the things straight in present.\n\u201c15 minutes.\u201d I reply and make my way to start yet another day just like past 8 months but before I leave this shore I put of the fire which I had set around the place. Out of all these things against me this is one thing that I am glad of this deserted place to give me my privacy.\nAs always my eyes search that place where I had seen her on the first day but as every other day even today I couldn\u2019t see her there maybe it was just by chance that she was here that day. I again console my heart which still wants to see her against my will. And in these 8 months every single day didn\u2019t end without an encounter of ours but every time I shifted my course away from her as those eyes held something which could not be comprehend. During the classes I try to gauge her reactions but she didn\u2019t let me through her lashes making it difficult to read her.\nThings which made these encounter possible were Yash & Pari and their budding love story. There talks left me know more about Geet, how she is, how even she came here after losing her family. How lonely she has become now and how she is coping with her life. What her aims are, how she has influenced Pari to be more focused about the future. I get to hear each and every word about them from Yash.\nThere is not a single place in the college which doesn\u2019t remind me of our encounter and just a week ago when Geet was searching for Pari near this fountain at the entrance of the college where I am standing that was the time we met again face to face to let me read her mind through her own blue eyes.\nThis time when the cover of her lashes had been shed for my view all I could see was the same mischief gleam in it. But what is she upto now, did that senior again became the scapegoat of her acts. She has been enjoying that senior\u2019s state to an extent which none knew except me as always after every fall of his she had walked away with a winning stride. One thing which even I didn\u2019t know was did she do anything which always landed him in trouble or was that a pure coincidence that whenever she was present he was embarrassed with one or the other thing.\nLast time I had accompanied Yash to the mall as girls wanted to do there shopping while Yash wanted to join them and I also went along with him. Once they had roamed alround the mall we had settled down in the food court to fill the hunger of stomach. The seating arrangement was in a semi circle round the table and at one end was Geet next to her was Pari and next was Yash, after him I sat.\nI smiled looking at the them planning for the seminar which I didn\u2019t even know there was I never had to bothered for any academic activity as even before I realise the need of the work it would have been done for me too. Yash was someone who used to do it for me I never did ask him for but he simple did it for me and then it become a silent treaty that he used to hand over all the assignments to me. I could have asked him the reason for it but then I never indulged in talking with anyone not even Yash, who was my hostel roommate.\nPari loved Yash but always gets irritated with his \u201cI am scared attitude\u201d college works were not an issue but handling the world or people was something he always held a back foot. I guess this was the reason Yash always used to be with me scared to be alone, scared that he might just get into trouble and I tagged with him because he never asked any questions about me but just used to bug me with non stop talking about the college or Pari or her friend Geet. That was much more than a vital reason to actually tolerate him and his actions.\nThere was sudden hustle bustle in the food court, apparently some waiter was pushed by someone making all the food in his hand to spilled on the ground and that person was none other than our same senior who had lead our ragging session. The owner was all set to bash the waiter & dismiss him from the job as he thougt the waiter couldn\u2019t even handle his customers properly, creating disturbance to them and also damaging his places aesthetics.\nAnd this senior of ours who was having fun in this trouble just was leaving creating the mess and while crossing over the table next us the kid who sat there was supposed to have her milk in the bottle but the kid opened the cap in a way that all the milk erupted out of it spilling it all over the place along with the wetting the pants of our beloved senior in turn making him embarrass infront of all the people. At that time her eyes showed \u201cyou deserve it\u201d look.\nToday too her eyes conveyed the same thing to me but who deserves that, was that me or was that someone else. I was still searching for answers when a loud laughter hit my ears and that was of Yash & Pari who came running & laughing even before I could ask them they started to narrate that the gardener was having trouble why water stopped suddenly coming in his pipes while watering the plants and then he tried to twist them in all direction water gushed out like a stream which unfortunately showered on our same darling senior.\nOnce Yash was here I moved out to our hostel when Yash again started his pleading to accompany him to Pari\u2019s house as she had challenged him \u201cYash if you love me you have to come to my hime without getting scared of my owner who stayed next door. Only then I will talk to you.\u201d Did I needed this pleadings no defiantly no, but still how would I just give in so I gave him \u201cI am not interested\u201d look and then I finally agreed to him.\nWe knocked at the door of the girl\u2019s home late at 12 midnight as it was quite a distance we had to travel. There was hesitation quite visible on Pari\u2019s face as she opened the windows to check who is banging the door at this hour. I could clearly see one was shocked while the other pretended to be shocked as she was not afraid of facing any situation. As it was a season of rain many would come inside the front yard for shelter but now it wasn\u2019t raining either and even if it was entertaining an outsider at this hour was not safe.\nWe stood at a distance so when she checked the window none were visible, then she had a confused look thinking who banged on the door. Just when she thought to close the window and return to bed we came out of the shadows scaring her a bit as she asked who it is. But only thing she heard was her own sound and crackle sound of the dry leaves.\nSurprise was the word Yash screamed making her squeal in shock but then she was happy to find her love leaving his inhabitation self.\nSurprise was the word Yash screamed making her squeal in shock but then she was happy to find her love there leaving his inhabitation self and visiting her.\n\u201cYash is this the way you come. There is a calling bell which you could always use then why were you banging the door like that. You just scared the hell out of us.\u201d Pari growled on Yash.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why she gets scared suddenly of such little things.\u201d said Pari referring to Geet\u2019s action.\n\u201cYash left a sigh once Geet left as he can have his little talk with Pari now without interruption. Now you will do as I say\u201d Yash whispered.\nLooking at them I thought they need a little more privacy so\u2026.\nI left that place at once and started to move backwards when I heard something rather say some sound. That made me realised that the path I choose leads to the back yard of the house where Geet went. The thought that she is there was enough for me to move more faster my mind constantly warned me not to go and face at this time but when did mind had any say in front of this heart.\nMy luck was not with me today as suddenly there was lighting followed by a noisy thunder. Normally boys liked these situations where girls would be scared and cling to boys but here it was a different story as I despised rain. Seeing the pouring rain my legs freeze at the place I was safe under the shelter in the pitch darkness where no one knew anyone would exist. Even in the most solitary life I have an angel who had descended from the heaven whom I could gaze till my hearts content.\nGeet was in her light violet velvet suit stood admiring the sky above. I stood as far as possible but my eyes could view her from head to toe, I guess she was also standing below some shelter as there was not a drop of rain falling on her. She was not only admiring it but also waiting for the rain to fall as the moment she stretched her palm a drop fell on it, she did the same again and again collecting the drops of the rain in her palm. It looked as if the rain was waiting for the orders of her to fall. Once it was full she let them drop on the ground making the sound like pearls were falling off from the necklace as they didn\u2019t just fall but also they had another path to follow.\nShe was the commander in chief imposing the flow of rain. Slowly the drops of rain increased & made its way from her shoulders to her long silky hands gliding over them to reach the small little fingers of her just before they descended to reach there fellow droplets. If that was the sight I beheld unknown to her next set of her acts just made my insides move as molten lava.\nThe water which blessed themselves touching her forehead slid through the sides measuring the length of her sleek neck before they disappeared into the fabric. The view brought him of my revive giving me a reality check about my act. I was not supposed to look at her like this minutely. She has always hid behind the mask of a meek girl and now thinking no one is here she would have let those masks off her face.\nShe might have not been this free had she known about my presence here. But I didn\u2019t have it in me to turn back from her. This time I wanted her to decide and it would be easy on me to feel her rejection than turning back from her. With this decision I let my legs lead towards the magnetic pull.\nI couldn\u2019t have stepped in rain too so I stood at the rim of the shelter making my presence known to her. Passing the message towards her clearly that she is not alone to let her barriers down and baring her oneself to me. She stood in the middle, hands out stretched to let the rain drench her. Even after making my presence evident she didn\u2019t deterred was she so involved in her own world that what is happening around, who is there beside her didn\u2019t matter or was she giving me a treat by letting me to witness her subtle movements of unparalleled grace.\nRain which had drenched her whole form gave a shiny effect to her. With a determination which none could stop her to express herself today neither the rain nor my presence. She bent her back in a semi circle swinging her hands in a way that looked like a white rainbow twinkling in the moon light. Was she dancing with rain or was rain dancing with her, was she following it or was that following her moves was all I could ponder about as she and rain matched steps with each other.\nUnknown to me \u201cGeet\u201d came out from my lips it came out just as a whisper and I doubt whether my own ears heard it or not. But as the name left my lips the rain just came to end like it was waiting for me to utter and it would stop and with not a drop of rain pouring her whole concentration turned to me. I stood there waiting for her reaction, would she walk away as I do or\u2026. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. She slowly closed the distance between us and stood right in front of me.\nHer eyes held an unknown compassion which I could not understand. I felt a sudden chill spreading around me was it the dip in the temperature or was it her who was cooling my fire in me. My eyes closed for a brief second to hide the things which it may give away if I look deep into the blue ones it may questioned me anything. There were many things which my heart wanted to convey but words were just not enough to express them. Many emotions were binding me with you bring in a new flavour sweeping us into a different world. This is the riddle which could not be hidden within me or with in her or even the world.\nI was still entranced in her when I felt her chilled hands touch my cheeks sending shiver down my body. It took only a second to ignite the fire in me; it took lot of efforts to break the shackles to let my hand to stretch so that I could feel that creamy skin. She closed her eyes to engrave the feel of me on her hand, so did I wanted to engrave it. I was just an inch away when she trembled back and before I could comprehend anything or hold her she collapsed on the ground & like how the water gushes out when the gates of the dam are opened the rain poured out on her.\nWhat happened was something has happened with me many times before too when ever I have left my confines things has gone messy. That is the reason why I have to be alone & none are allowed to be with me. My mother left me giving birth to me to live in this world all alone; my father was there only till that another natural calamity which shook more than half of the village when I was a small kid. From that time all I have led is a life alone each day was like a year or even more than that.\nRelatives were there to support me but even that didn\u2019t last for more than few days as they would fell into deep troubles due to me. So I had spent most of my life in an orphanage far away from everyone who was my family once. This was my curse which I am still burdened with. And today that has spread to Geet, she fell the moment I thought to ignore my curse but it was all present to remind me of the repercussions if avoided.\nI still stood the same way gazing at her fallen state; I couldn\u2019t gather enough courage to even check her. What if she also just left because of my mistake? It would have been better to be away than to live in guilt for becoming an endangered curse to someone else. With the sudden enormous sound of water gained the attention of Pari & Yash so they came out to check the reason for it and all they could see was Geet lying in the pool of water while I had lost my voice to tell anything to them.\nI started to take my steps away from her whereas Pari was trying to revive Geet by patting her cheeks. Yash asked her to pull under the shelter first so that she wouldn\u2019t catch cold. They tried to rub her legs & hands it was turning little blue due to chillness of water. Yash looked back at me to ask what happened but what would I reply, there was nothing to tell it was all my fault to have agreed with him to accompany Yash to her place.\nMy strides were moving fast to just hide myself away from everyone especially from those blue eyes mermaid of my life. I push all the things in front of me & put everything on fire with my own hands but would that reduce the blaze in me. Ripping of my self also didn\u2019t reduce the helplessness in me. Why should I be compled to live a life like this with no love no happiness all alone nothing pleasing can exist around me? Why it is that anything that wants to give me bit contentment would turn into ashes before I could embrace it. Why can\u2019t I hold a little bliss in my palm?\nAll I had heard was they were taking her to the nearby doctor, I so wanted to check on her but it was best with me not going near her. I waited at the shores waiting for the sun to break the darkness, which was actually trying to consume me within it. After what seems like eternity I just couldn\u2019t wait more but wanted to know if she was fine, I decided I would only see from far & then will move out before anyone would actually notice my presence.\nI stood at the doorway hearing that melodious voice of speaking to the doctor which was a relief till I heard there talks. The doctor was quite upset about something but what was the fault of Geet in all these things which happened.\n\u201cGeet, I am telling you last time you have to be careful, I can\u2019t hide these things everytime. It was just pure luck that your friends bought you to me, what would have happened if they would have taken you to other doctor.\u201d Doctor was scolding sternly.\n\u201cDoc, I would have managed it.\u201d Geet answered meekly.\n\u201cRight the way you just managed it today. I have answered others as you got dehydrated but I want answers from you now? What happened & how did it happen if you had taken all the precautions.\u201d Doc questioned.\n\u201c2 days, what will I do here for 2 days? I am perfectly fine & I would like to take your leave now as I need to attend the class.\u201d Replied shocked Geet on the sudden order passed by her doctor but when did she listen to others.\n\u201cNo, you are my friend, so bye.\u201d Geet stromed out of the room after saying that.\nThere talk left me in thinking what was it that they were talking about was she hiding something or is she under some medication due to some disease. But if I question the doctor she would definitely not spit out the truth. Doctor must have known Geet for a quite a period and that\u2019s why she was so comfortable & then also she hid the truth with Yash & Pari also that too even before she consulting Geet. I should follow her to know more but after what happened yesterday night I need to be very careful & stay away from her.\nI have been observing her more meticulously from past few hours but nothing actual changed in her ways neither in action nor in words. Still we didn\u2019t speak neither she nor Yash or Pari actually asked me about that night. It was as if nothing happened, don\u2019t know what Geet said to them but they were actually being careful with Geet, making sure that she had lot of liquids. They didn\u2019t let her give presentations in seminar also but only person who regretted that was me as I couldn\u2019t hear her.\nYash asked me to help them in the last seminar and the group discussions for the year before college breaks for the exams so that Geet could take proper rest. I agreed but I didn\u2019t know what I am supposed to do so he gave some notes which I had to go through & speak about them. Seminar was said to be on one of the topics in some subject which we read but the group discussion was just a practice session so that everyone would get good exposure to the presentation skills. I actually wondered what am I going to do as I had not an iota of idea how these are done but this would help Geet is all I know so I had to do it.\nSeminar finished & I don\u2019t exactly remember what all I have to say. Seeing my capabilities with words they had given me a small part. Was that a 5 min material which I finished it in 2 minute or was that only a 1 minutes one for which I too 2. But whatever it was that ended without much hanky panky. Well one hurdle was crossed & the other awaited. Yes the group discussion would start in a while, groups were made. Pari, I & few other class mates were selected and made the group. The topic was read out it was \u201cMyth\u201d.\nWith that few started to oppose it & many started to agree with it. But when I heard what all they were discussing I couldn\u2019t stop my self from putting my view in it.\n\u201cHow could you say that God is a myth\u201d I questioned.\n\u201cIf he was there then people would not have suffered unnecessarily, take your example are you not an orphan\u2026 why?? because God took away your parents that too in a natural calamity which was controlled by God.\u201d Pari replied.\n\u201cIt was not the God who controlled these calamities they are done by the people who are posses the power to protect the nature and people in this world.\u201d I counter replied.\n\u201cOh you are a believer of those grandma bedtime stories in which God entrusts some power to three people who were termed as guards of the earth but these people quarrelled among themselves to attain the supremacy over the human beings. If only one is left they would be invincible who could be termed as equal to God.\u201d Pari questioned.\nThe whole discussion was heating up between Pari & Maan and everyone present there were just a mute spectators as they didn\u2019t know where it all would go to. Some had heard these stories in there childhood from there elders but then with time all these things were termed as only story.\n\u201cYes I am a believer of it but that is not the whole truth what all things they would have to undergo for being a guard is not known to many. Life span of these persons would be more than 400 years which they should be spent away from everyone if those powers are entrusted. These powers would be there curse but also a boon, which could be used to restrict many calamaties. And humans never get to know what things were averted but can only know & rememeber when these gaurds fail. Yes they fight among themselves but are these fights for gaining supremacy or to gain freedom from those things is still a mystery which none have been able to know it till now.\u201d I said.\nI would have said many more things but I was stopped by the sapphire eyed girl who pleaded me through her eyes to not say a word more and how could I utter a single word after that. My tongue was now tied with her plea so I let every other person to continue with the discussion and in no time the hour flee so did the students from the class.\nThis was the last class for the year and students would forget about all these talks is what I could wish for as many were worried about their individual exams or was excited for the farewell party of the seniors which the juniors had organised for. I don\u2019t know whether I blabbered more than required or was my speech revealed more than necessary things.\nPari responded \u201cHe started\u201d pointing all the blame towards me.\n\u201cI know who started what even I was here only. Now do you think about yourself Maan what were you doing talking all these stories.\u201d Geet turned towards me questioning but she was shocked and continued \u201cNow where did he go?\u201d as I was not there standing but had started to move out of the class saving my self from there questioning eyes.\nToday is the farewell party girls were dressed in red & white combination where as boys were in red & black combo. For a change juniors had planned to rag the seniors on there own farewell which was led by Pari & group, well I knew whose idea this would be. Time has changed so had the relations too in past 10 months seniors have become more friendly and supportive, thus playing pranks with them would not be a trouble and anyways they are leaving the institute so the coast is clear for fun.\nParty was in the open air hall in the grounds of the college which had a stage at one end where Geet was speaking to Pari who stood beside her with today\u2019s event manager & at the far end was the fountain where I stood gazing her every move. She looked angelic in that white salwar of hers as blue veil adored the slender creamy neck. Yash was running behind Pari helping her out with all his love and I was standing away from everyone feeling glad that atleast there are people whom I would love and they are infront of me.\nPeople dressed in vibrant colors were already to enjoy & have fun as the party was about to start. Whereas things don\u2019t happen as you wish for and who knows that better than me and exactly the way I had the intrusion there was a sudden hassle alround the place everyone were running into the college that\u2019s when I witnessed the tornado coming towards us.\nI stood waiting the tornado to come to me as what can it do to me carry & through me somewhere that\u2019s it right. However when it was just a yard away from the ground when it stood still as if something stopped its way. When I look around the ground there is no one present but my eyes stopped at one place where a girl lay may be unconscious and it didn\u2019t take a minute to know who that was as she is Geet only girl who was in her blue while everyone was in red & white.\nI flew away from the college far away from the place where I burnt her with my own flames as I was not able stand any more minute at that place; how long do I have to face the same thing again and again. Everytime when the sadness has engulfed me I have always consoled my heart that it isn\u2019t my mistake everyone has to go through these pains in their long-lasting life. Heavy as this heart feels now with the overwhelming emotions I stare at the Sun which is all set to take a dip in the vast expanse of ocean but now I have nothing to hold on to there is a deep stillness which has settled in me as the world has moved but I haven\u2019t.\nWith the increase in the pour even ocean seems to be more intended to swallow me within as I hit the first waves of the huge mass. It left me shocked as I could hold to anything, I felt like I am moving without my own will. Today there was only one will that was to try every possible way to put off this blaze. Even the thought has not left my mind I was hit by another way, now it seemed as if I was floating in it and next second I was submergered in it. I want to go deep into it so I tried to find the ground and started to walk into the depth of it.\nAs I stepped deep within my luck just flew away because the water which was soothing my soul just sweeped in making a space between me & the water mass. Same like Geet had created when we were in the college, was she here or was it someone else who possessed the same power. \u201cGeet \u2026\u201d my lips took her name as a whisper and just as that day today also rain which had been pouring stopped and my attention went towards the form in the shadows.\n\u201cYes \u2026 Maan we can but are you willing to be with me till the end. Will you love me without any of my ability to control water? Will you love me\u2026.?\u201d She replied with uncertainity.\n\u201cMaan, you need to let go this fear and worry nothing will happen to us. Yes, we will have to work hard to survive now.\u201d She pressed her ear to my chest while she continued \u201cBut together we will surpass every hurdle that comes in our way. This isn\u2019t yours anymore but mine now so stop troubling it.\u201d She said refering to my heart also showing her dominance over me.\n\u201cShh\u2026You don\u2019t have to voice it Maan, your face convey\u2019s it all, every thought that your heart analyzes, every notion it evaluates, every outcome it concludes. You are just as open book to me as I am to you.\u201d Geet declared her point.\nBy the time I was back Yash was up and had sat up against the rock as I hand over a bottle of water to him. He seemed surprised and undoubtly happy about something.\n\u201cYou guys are making fun of me and we are all worried for you. I wouldn\u2019t have been awake had I sleept last night, but after that storm had eloped you guys there isn\u2019t a place where we have not searched you. Today I thought lets look at the opposite direction too and here I found you guys.\u201d Yash explained the reason of his presence.\n\u201cCarry him, I can walk we will get more oppurunities going forward.\u201d Geet smiled winking at me.\nAnd today this diary answered me why I could never hear what they were worried about was that about the mess or about me contolling my powers as both could read each other face without voicing a word from their mouth. Today I am very happy reading that my parents too had powers like me, actually defeated the air power and that\u2019s why I their daughter am gifted with power of air.\nShe grew faster than we could think and tomorrow is her 18th birthday and I couldn\u2019t see her confused and worried anymore uncessarily too. Yes even her face revealed every secret of hers. And that\u2019s why I decided to place this diary in a place where she could get her hands on it.\n\u201cWhen were we separate from eachother Geet.\u201d Papa buttered Mama so easily.",

That purchase was just the start for Guo. Last month, the 17-year-old, who used to work part-time at a streetwear store, spent $800,000 on 248 skateboard decks, which had been released by the brand over a 20-year period between 1998 and 2018. Originally collected by Ryan Fuller, these boards include pieces that blur the line between fashion and art, featuring work by artists like Damien Hirst, George Condo, and Jeff Koons. There are also two Louis Vuitton decks\u2014the first, in 2000, lifted the luxury label\u2019s logo without permission, and later, the two labels partnered for the much-hyped fall 2017 collection.\nGuo may be young, but he comes from a family of art collectors. \u201cMy father is a collector who buys from auction houses and galleries. My older sister graduated with a degree in art history from UBC, and she is my father\u2019s adviser in his acquisition of fine art. She is also a collector of fine art, and the two of them are my mentors,\u201d Guy told Robb Report via e-mail. The family owns pieces by towering artists like Picasso and Monet. The teen collector\u2019s proclivities, however, veer more toward street culture.\nAs you might expect from the man who bought Supreme chopsticks, Guo is no stranger to the New York\u2013based brand. He says he owns around 200 items from Supreme, \u201cincluding a few skateboards, some clothes, and many accessories.\u201d But his favorite piece? A Supreme x Everlast punching bag, which is available on the website Kixclusive right now for a cool $15,000. \u201cThe piece is very rare, and I think it is absolutely fascinating that Supreme collaborated with Everlast,\u201d Guo said.\nAs for his most recent acquisition, Guo said the decks will go on view in an upcoming gallery in Vancouver for both hypebeasts and art connoisseurs alike to enjoy.",

    "text": "New York, NY - January 15, 2014 - Today, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer announced that he has received a commitment that John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) will be assigned additional customs agents as the result of increased appropriations for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill. This bill has boosted CBP\u2019s funding by $165.7 million in order for the agency to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide. Specifically, the bill increases CBP\u2019s overall budget to $10.6 billion, which is over $220 million more than FY2013. Schumer explained that $165.7 million of the new funding was explicitly prescribed \u201cfor the purpose of hiring, training, and equipping new U.S. customs and border protection offices.\u201d During a confirmation hearing today, Schumer secured a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske, who is currently undergoing the confirmation process to be Commissioner of CBP, that he would commit to bringing an adequate portion of these new agents and resources to JFK once he has been confirmed.\nIn September 2013, Schumer made an appeal to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement new measures that would help alleviate incredibly long lines for travelers using customs at JFK and he continued his push at a confirmation hearing today for Kerlikowske. Schumer\u2019s appeal comes after a report revealed that customs lines at JFK Airport were among the longest wait times in the country. According to the report, the average delay during peak hours could be two hours or more.\nOn July 1, 2013, at 6 am, the wait was 140 minutes.\nOn August 3, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 120 minutes.\nOn August 24, 2013, at 4 pm, the wait was 3 hours.\nSchumer has long advocated measures to decrease these wait times, including a personal call in September to then-Acting DHS Secretary Rand Beers, during which Schumer asked Beers to approve and install new automated Passport kiosks, as well as assign additional Custom and Border Patrol agents at JFK. Schumer also urged his colleagues to boost funding for the Customs and Border Protection in the Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations bill, above the current 2013 levels and called current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to press his case.\nToday, Schumer announced that the recently released appropriations agreement called for $165.7 million to hire 2,000 new agents nationwide, and that he has received a commitment from Gil Kerlikowske that, when confirmed as Commissioner of CBP, he will assign an adequate portion of these new agents to JFK. These additional agents will enable the airport to decrease wait times and continue to be a major economic driver.",

    "text": "by B. A. COLA and J. M. URITIS - Missile and Surface Radar Division DEP, Moorestown, N. J.\nJOSEPH M. URITIS graduated from Newark College of Engineering in 1937 with a BSME. Before joining RCA in 1946, he was a design engineer for Bernard Aviation Equipment Corp., New York City. In 1941, he engaged in the design and test of main propulsion and auxiliary shipboard equipment at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. At RCA, Mr. Uritis has designed disk recorders for broadcast studios and other commercial applications. As a member of the Advanced Development Group, he was responsible for conception of the tape files used in RCA Electronic Data Processing equipment. In video recording, he was active in the design and development of the time division multiplex video recorder, and later, the quadruplex color video recorder. He was responsible for the design of the Broadband Recorder (AN/TLH-I) built for the Signal Corps. When the BMEWS program started, he designed magnetic drums and discs for that project, and later was responsible for design of the TRADEX tape transport. During design of the precision tape recorders for Bell Labs, he was responsible for the mechanical design.\nMr. Uritis holds 8 patents in the recorder field.\nBENJAMIN A. COLA graduated from Drexel Institute in June 1950 with a BSEE. At this time he joined RCA and worked on the design of power supplies, video circuits, TV airborne cameras, naval radar tracking equipment and servo mechanisms in the Special Devices Department. A period of one year was spent on systems analysis of shoran bombing and reconnaissance equipment. He received an MSEE degree in June 1955 at the University of Pennsylvania. In August 1955 he was transferred to the newly formed Missile and Surface Radar Section, where he worked on analog data processing assignments for TALOS, ATLAS, BMEWS, DAMP, and TRADEX. His most recent assignment was design project engineer on the development of a precision high speed tape recorder.\nThis multiple-channel, wideband precision tape recorder was developed as a basic element in a tracking radar system to be used in multiple target environments. All signals received by the radar tracking the target in real time are tape recorded. Thus, all targets viewed by the radar during a \"live\" exercise can be repeatedly acquired, tracked, and analyzed through playback at a later date. To permit recovery of maximum information, data is recorded in the form of unprocessed radar IF signals; then on playback, the optimum signal-processing system recovers each target parameter of interest.\nRadar target parameters such as range, doppler, and angle position must be measured precisely; at the same time, target resolution and relative amplitude must be preserved. Such performance requirements impose challenging demands on a radar tape recorder - particularly signal-to-noise performance, gain and phase tracking between channels, gain linearity, transport velocity stability, and interchannel jitter.\nFig. 1 shows the complete radar tape recorder designed to meet these standards of performance. The radar tape recorder provides 15 channels with a bandwidth capability in excess of 6 Mc; the recorder operates at a tape speed of 1,180 ips and a velocity stability of better than 1 part in 105. The recording time is 6 minutes. The radar system utilizes these capabilities to record 8 channels of 3.5 Mc video radar signals along with 7 wideband channels of timing, digital, and other reference signals for processing by the radar in serial form.\nThe radar tape recorder (Fig. 2) stores ungated if information from the uhf and L-band receivers so that during subsequent playbacks, targets can be acquired and tracked in angle, range, and doppler.\nThe receiver-exciter sends repetition rate pulses to the UHF and L-band transmitters where the power is stepped up and sent to the antenna for transmission. The receiver-exciter receives the returns from targets and sends them to the tape recorder and tracking receiver.\nThe tracking receiver (in conjunction with the range tracker) tracks targets in angle, range, and doppler during real time or from tape playback. The tracking receiver also provides agc, scintillation, doppler, and range information to describe the target to the data recorder. The tracking receiver also provides azimuth and elevation errors to the angle servos that drive the pedestal, keeping the antenna on target during live track.\nBy recording the radar returns on tapes, it is possible to separate and analyze the targets of a missile shot as many times as desired and, thereby, effect an economy of radar systems and missile firings.\nBased on the principal radar requirements of Table I, specifications for the radar tape recorder were determined. Requirements for frequency and polarization diversity and for monopulse angle tracking resulted in a need for eight signal channels. Range and doppler accuracies were improved through the use of a recorded if reference signal and a range clock signal. Additional channels were used for a transport servo-speed reference, pedestal angular position data, and time-of-day codes - resulting in a 15-channel machine (see chart of Table II).\nThe principal specifications for the radar tape recorder are Table III. Reasons for some of these specifications are described herein. The signal-to-noise (S/N) specification is dictated by the desired system dynamic range. Velocity stability is necessary to assure doppler tracking accuracy as well as to minimize the occurrence of spurious signal spectral lines due to transport velocity modulation. Gain and phase track specifications assure accuracy in the measurement of target angle offset.\nGain and phase linearity maintains good target resolution by avoiding pulse distortion or distortion echoes. Low interchannel jitter is important in measuring accurately the signal polarization vector, range, and angle. Bandwidth is determined by the radar pulse characteristic; at the signal input to the recorder, the pulse is in the form of a cosine squared.\n1) Gain linearity and gain tracking are very difficult to achieve in an am system because of the effect of the nonlinear magnetization characteristic of the tape and because of variations in tape sensitivity.\n2) An fm system minimizes the effects of tape drop outs, variations in sensitivity of the magnetics and am variations introduced by changes in the effective head-air-gap with tape pressures. Good gain linearity can be achieved by frequency modulators and demodulators.\nThe choice of FM recording results in the disadvantage of greater circuit complexity because of the above requirements for frequency modulators and demodulators and also the need for more bandwidth than that in an am system. In fm, the bandwidth required to pass the sideband frequencies depends on the desired S/N performance, and on a minimum fm carrier frequency that prevents fold-over of the side frequencies. The final choice resulted in a 4.5-Mc fm carrier frequency with significant sideband frequencies extending from 0.2 Mc to 8Mc.\nThe 8-Mc bandwidth required that the relative speed between tape and head exceed a minimum value determined by the magnetic head gap-length. Since head gap-length could not conveniently be made less than 40 microinches (0.000040 inch), a tape speed of 1,180 ips was used; at this speed, 6 miles of tape are required to provide 5 minutes of recording time. Because of the requirement for multiple channels, longitudinal recording was chosen.\nThe basic design criteria for the tape recorder were established, based on a consideration of signal-to-noise, gain tracking, gain linearity, bandwidth and multiple channel capability.\nSatisfying the requirements for velocity stability and interchannel jitter depended to a large extent on the mechanical perfection of the tape transport and the performance of the servo speed control. The main elements of the transport are shown in Fig. 3. The recorder components are assembled to a jig plate which is accurately aligned and attached to a rigid frame to assure a precise tape path. The complete assembly is shock-mounted within its cabinet.\nThe 5-minute recording requirement resulted in 30-inch-diameter reels weighing 50 pounds and containing 6 miles of 1.1-mil magnetic tape plus 2,500 feet of clear leader at each end. The tape is accelerated to full recording speed in 60 seconds and is stopped in the same time. The reels are equipped with quick-disconnect knobs to facilitate fast reloading and permit uninterrupted recording with two transports. Tape guides and tensioners are air lubricated so that frictional contact to the tape occurs only at the capstan edge-guide and at the magnetic heads.\nRemote control of recording, subsequent repeated playbacks, and rewinds dictated that the tape remain threaded and taut during and following each run. To accomplish this, programmed acceleration and deceleration cycles were employed at the start and end of the tape runs. A length of clear polyester leader is attached to each end of the tape; transitions from clear leader to tape are sensed photoelectrically to initiate the program.\nThe capstan-head assembly of Fig. 4 is designed for quick replacement by utilizing an air manifold which automatically seals upon installation of the capstan. Two blocks of magnetic heads, one an 8-track and the other a 7-track are supplied by the RCA Broadcast and Communication Products Division. Heads are prealigned on arms for fast replacement once initial adjustment of the head arm support has been made.\nTo achieve constant tape speed, the capstan assembly employs an air-turbine drive and hydrostatic air bearings. Capstan speed is sensed by a tone wheel and controlled by a hysteresis brake; both are integral parts of the capstan shaft. To minimize longitudinal vibrations, the tape is stabilized by making simultaneous contact with both the capstan and the heads. Since the tape is not perfectly smooth nor of uniform thickness, it is necessary to relieve the capstan surface behind the area where the heads contact the tape.\nThe velocity stability specification of 1 part in 105 imposes a severe runout requirement on the capstan assembly; the angular velocity generates flutter components of 87cps and higher multiples which are above the bandwidth of the capstan-servo correction capability.\nTherefore, the dynamic runout of the capstan must be held to less than 20 microinches; it is done by using the ultimate in precision grinding, hand lapping, and dynamic balancing. An additional benefit in reducing the effects of capstan runout is derived from depressing the heads into the tape a*bove the capstan grooves; thus, the heads may be firmly positioned at a fixed radius from the rotational axis of the capstan. Head contact pressure is controlled by a very precise adjusting screw which advances the head only 5 mils per revolution. Pressure applied is measured as an increment of the capstan hysteresis brake current.\nMechanical resonances throughout the tape path produce variations in tape tension, resulting in minute (but not inconsequential) variations in tape velocity at the capstan. Such variations can be caused by improper tape guide design, or by insufficient damping where resonant systems exist in the tape path, as at the tape tensioners. Since these effects are not necessarily uniform, or in-phase across the width of the tape, they produce the undesirable effect defined in the specifications as \"phase jitter.\" The allowable phase jitter between signals (recorded half the width of the tape apart) is \u00b120 nsec; this corresponds to roughly a differential displacement of 24 microinches.\n4) precise alignment of all tape guides.\nCompressed air, supplied by a remote unit at 100-psi nominal pressure, operates the transport. Air is oil free and dried to -40\u00b0F dew point. Outlet air-supply filters and filters at the air inlets to the cabinet and to the capstan air-bearing line protect the air-pressure regulating valves and the close-fitting capstan bearings. In the event of a compressor failure, a reserve air supply brings the transport to a safe halt.\nPressure-sensitive switches are set a few pounds below the lower limit of the normal pressure variation range of the air supply. When the air-supply pressure falls below a predetermined value, turbine air is cut off and the transport goes into its programmed stopping cycle. Mechanical brakes on the reel spindles stop the reels quickly to minimize tape spillage in the event of a power failure or loss of tape tension.\nEach tape reel is belt driven by a two-phase 400-cps induction motor and controlled by an independent servo system. The control signal for the reel servo loop is obtained from the tape sensor device nearest the particular reel involved (see Fig. 3). The stator of the induction potentiometer is excited by an AC reference supply and produces an error signal proportional to the velocity error of the tape at the reel. The Ac-induced voltage in the rotor, which is the error signal, is amplified and applied to a carrier-referenced demodulator; then, the dc output of this circuit is used to drive the operational amplifier shown in Fig. 5.\nAn additional feedback loop is provided by an AC tachometer on the servo motor shaft. The 400-cps signal is demodulated to dc to make it compatible with the tape error signal; it is easier to realize the proper stability networks in the dc domain, and AC quadrature problems are completely eliminated - providing a more stable design with less effort.\nThe tachometer feedback signal is combined with the tape speed-error signal in a summing operational amplifier to compensate for the non-linearity of the magnetic amplifiers which are as the servo power amplifiers. The summing operational amplifier output is the servo control signal used to drive the magnetic amplifier; the magnetic amplifier controls the 400-cps power supplied to the reel servo motor.\nThe capstan servo drives the tape with highly precise speed control by two servo loops: one a frequency lock, and the other a phase comparison control to obtain high sensitivity (Fig. 6). Pulses derived from the capstan tone wheel and proportional to tape speed are passed through a 400-usec delay line; capstan speed is varied by the servo until the pulse frequency corresponds with the delay of the line. The 400-usec delay line is equivalent to a tone-wheel frequency of 2,500 pps (this servoing of the capstan speed to near synchronous value is called a frequency lock). When a frequency lock occurs, the phase of the reference 2,500 pps begins to zero beat with the tone wheel; thus, a phase error is produced which adjusts the capstan speed to a full phase lock.\nThe phase detector producing the speed-control signal is extremely sensitive; the slightest change of capstan tone-wheel frequency results in a considerable phase error. Once the capstan servo is locked in, complete control of the speed is maintained by the phase loop. The basic speed control of the capstan driving the tape is obtained by applying air pressure to the capstan turbine. The turbine air pressure would drive the capstan at a speed much higher than needed; however, the servo controlled hysteresis brake reduces it to the desired value.\nThe capstan speed is locked to a crystal oscillator by servoing the tone wheel during the record mode. During the playback mode, the control track, a recorded 2,500-pps reference frequency standard, is servoed to the same crystal oscillator. The slight difference between the capstan speed and the tape speed is removed by this playback servo technique. Electronically variable delay lines are used in those channels requiring additional velocity refinement corrections to the radar data (Fig. 7).\nThe technique of comparing the playback of a recorded 2,500-pps crystal clock with the same crystal clock and using the resultant error voltage to drive the capstan cancels out all low-frequency speed variations of the tape. However, this method does not remove high-frequency components of speed variation resulting from such sources as capstan asymmetry and high-frequency tape flutter. The capstan turns at 87 cps and introduces Fourier series tape-speed components 174 and 261 cps in both record and playback modes; such components cannot be servoed out because of the limited response of the capstan. To remove the effects of the capstan asymmetry and other speed deviations, electronically variable delay lines are inserted into all channels that need precision speed stabilization; a control voltage advances and delays each channel of data in order to make the tape information appear to be coming from a perfectly constant speed tape.\nThe control of these electronically variable delay lines is accomplished with the closed-reference automatic-time-correction (atc) loop of Fig. 7. When the capstan servo has locked in, the reference playback signal averages 2,500-pps - but there will be expansions and contractions of the pulse periods for the reasons previously described. This reference playback signal is inserted into an electronically variable delay line that removes the high-frequency speed variations. The tape-playback 2,500-pps reference is compared to the clock-reference 2,500 pps in a phase detector; the resultant error signal changes on a pulse-to-pulse basis. This error is amplified and the atc loop stabilized by passing the signal through an operational amplifier with the proper transfer function.\nThe resultant amplified error output is used to drive the reference delay line, completing a closed loop. It is apparent that the error signal created will advance or delay the playback pulses to slave them to the clock-reference 2,500 pps by removing the high-frequency components of flutter. At this point, the 2,500-pps reference passing through the delay has had the stabilization of the capstan servo control and the atc servo electronic correction. The signal that drives the reference delay line also drives the six signal delay-lines because the speed correction required is approximately the same for all channels.\nThe interchannel jitter must be small in order to make this type of delay line correction effective; moreover, this condition is assured by meticulous design of the tape transport. There must be very little phase jitter between channels, since the correction signal of the atc servo loop is not only applied to the reference line, but also (as an open-loop correction) to all of the signal delay lines.\nTo measure intertrack jitter during the mechanical development of the tape transport, the precise measuring technique of Fig. 8 was used. It consists of recording a 1.5-Mc sine-wave signal upon the two tracks in question, playing these channels back, and then mixing them down to 200 kc. The exchange of phase angle between the two signals remains the same at 200 kc as it was at 1.5 Mc, and it can be handled by a commercially available phase meter. The output of the phase meter was observed on a scope, spectrum analyzer, and pen recorder. A typical pen recording of the intertrack phase jitter is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe most interesting aspects of the signal electronics for the radar tape recorder relate to the problems of linearity and bandwidth in the precision fm channels. Fig. 10 shows the elements of a typical \"fm\" channel. In the record mode, the signal in the form of radar video pulses is converted to an \"fm\" signal in a modulator. It is then amplified in a record amplifier which drives the record-playback head as a constant-current generator. On playback, the signal is amplified in a preamplifier and then in a playback amplifier which includes aperture equalization to compensate for the magnetic-head frequency response characteristic. The signal is then reconverted to a radar video signal in the frequency demodulator.\nThe bandwidth required in an fm system is dictated by the rise-time requirement; the system S/N ratio is a function of this bandwidth.\nFrom this expression, it can be shown that a peak frequency deviation of 1.5 Mc achieves S/N performance greater than 40db assuming that the ratio of peak carrier to rms tape noise per megacycle is 48db.\nThe radar tape recorder was designed to record radar pulses with a video bandwidth of 3.5 Mc; for the frequency modulation of these signals, a 4.5-Mc carrier was used to minimize the effect of \"fold over\" (side frequency terms) in the fm signal.\nThe primary problem of equalization is related to the need for compensating the amplitude-versus-frequency response of the magnetic playback process. The flat amplitude and linear phase responses required to meet the performance specifications for the radar tape recorder were achieved. The following equation, however, shows that the amplitude response of the playback process is not flat and further that the phase response is linear. Therefore, the equalization must compensate for the amplitude response of the playback process without introducing a nonlinear phase characteristic.\nAnalysis of the magnetics problem results in the following equation for the output voltage from a playback head, assuming a sinusoidal recorded flux on the tape.\nTwo tape recorders have been in continuous operation on the pacific missile range for almost a year and have recorded and preserved much valuable data for further analysis and evaluation. The advanced techniques employed have proven invaluable in the study of missile re-entry.\nCredit for work on the original Tradex tape recording system, which was a forerunner of the high-speed precision tape system described in this paper, is due to H. R. Warren and his associates in the DEP Communications Systems Division.\nAlso, credit for magnetic head design is extended to the Magnetic Head Development and Design Group of the Broadcast and Communications Products Division, under the direction of B. F. Melchionni. This project was completed successfully because of the tireless efforts of many people with varied skills. It would be unjust not to mention two of the technical giants, Thomas Bolger and Jackson, who did so much to bring this project to fruition.\nTape speed, 1,180 ips, max.\nGap scatter, 40 u inch max.\nMounting: precision magnetic record-playback heads on precision machined rocker arms which are completely replaceable with only one adjustment, head pressure (by two self-locking coarse and fine adjust screws).\nsignal Crosstalk, 50 db max.\nSignal to noise, 30 db min.\nAll distortion, - 30 db min.\nCrosstalk, - 50 db max.\nduty cycle Rise time: 0.1 usee. max.\nFig. 1 - The high-precision instrumentation tape recorder.\nFig. 2 - Acquisition of data by tracking radar plus recording and storage of such data by precision tape recorder.\nFig. 3 - Tape transport.

    "text": "Week 2 weigh in this morning and I have lost 10lbs!!\nGreat job! This is amazing! Keep up the amazing work!\nWay to go on your 10 Lbs loss!! Yahooo!!! Keep on, keeping on!!\nSo had a very rough week with staying on track, not only did the long weekend trip me up, I was craving everything under the moon this week and struggled everyday. My weight fluctuated a lot this week and was back up to 278 but this mornings \"official\" weigh in is at 272 which I can live with because my cravings were caused by TOM which finally came on Friday, so hoping that by staying on target next weeks weigh in will be at least 265. Now that it is the weekend I have to be especially strong because at least during the week I have routine because of work that help keeps me on track. The carnival is also in town and we took the kiddo last night and she had a blast, I had worked yesterday to make sure I had enough cals left and had a great workout so I didn't feel guilty having a corn dog, which I order the small one and that was more than enough to satisfy the craving. On the way out of the carnival the family wanted deep fried oreo's which are just as horrific for you as they sound, but we always get them, just happens this year I am trying to lose weight, but we still got them and I had one so that is over and done with. Kiddo wants to go back today and I will take her since she has some tickets left but not getting any food today, but we might if we get in a really good workout get an ice cream cone. I decided I am not going to get rid of all the things in my life that I enjoy, I just have to learn to moderate and to workout to burn it off. I have cut out a lot of the unnecessary crud that is so harmful and I have started eating breakfast and lunch and snacks through out the day instead of waiting until I get home and then binge until the time I go to bed. Those little changes alone are making the difference. It is going to be a slow weight loss, but I have lost the weight very fast before and gained every pound back and then some. So just making lifestyle changes and just taking care of me for a change.\nLast edited by jenfett; 06-04-2011 at 11:22 AM.\nGlad you were able to maintain through a rough weekend. I hope you get your new siggy tomorrow.\nYay I was able to set up my signature today!! Little things make me happy.\nDown 7 lbs since last Saturday! I know some of that is water so I was happy that I made it to my weekly goal!\nHad a great week I stayed on track. I went to the gym everyday and had wonderful workouts! I did not binge at all, I have made it through 12 days without a slip up at all!\nMy daughter and I walked in Relay for Life yesterday afternoon, we couldn't stay the entire day and night because my daughter is only 6 and it was super hot so we were out there for 4 and a 1/2 hours and we clocked in 6 miles which is wonderful and we had a wonderful time. Next year we plan on being there start to finish so we will build up to it over the next year.\nLife is good, I have changed a lot mentally over the past month and it has made a difference. I am so much more happier than I have been in a very long time and when momma is happy, everyone is happy LOL I am half way to my first mini goal and once I get there I will do a week of maintenance. Maybe two weeks. To make sure I can stay at that weight before I take it to another level so I can knock off the next 30 lbs. I am hoping by doing this I won't hit that dreaded wall that I always seem to hit.\nSince I did Relay yesterday (which Saturday is my normal break day) today I am resting, my body aches a bit today so I am going to relax and rest and be ready to hit hard again tomorrow!\nwow.. you have already committed (hardest part for me).\nits just going to get better from here !\n\"Official weigh in week 5\"\nMade it through the week very well, worked out every single day and stayed on plan and didn't have any slip ups in meals. I can tell already that my heart and lungs are getting much stronger because I am able to to go a full 35 minutes on the elliptical now and I know I could go longer but my lunch breaks are only an hour and I have to shower because I do get very sweaty. I am able to work with my heartrate around 146 to 150 for 30 of those minutes so I know I am getting healthier regardless of what the scales say. I have had a pretty crappy day but have been on my feet since 7am taking care of my kids first case and hopefully the last case of lice, I was livid to find out they don't do screenings in school any more because it \"hurts the kids feelings\" when they get sent home with lice, so instead now they let them just run a muck and don't tell anyone or even find out when there is an outbreak. But after spending 5 hours working on her hair (she has very long and thick hair) I then cleaned everything on the top floor of the house and have washed all of the bedding and pretty much all of the clothes again. On top of that I got an abscessed tooth yesterday and have been dealing with that as well. The positive thing is that I stayed very busy today and got loads of exercise cleaning the house. I will finish the laundry and clean the bottom floor tomorrow and I have to wash and vacuum the car to make sure there are no buggies in there. I know that it happens to just about every kid, I just hate it LOL. Anywho that's my weekly update.\nSeriously wanting to give up today, it was a really crappy weekend and I feel like why flippin bother anymore. Just having a blue day I guess and hoping that when I go to the gym at lunch it will snap me out of my funk. Just feeling used anymore so why should I try and make myself better, no one gives a real damn anyways. The answer to that question I know is, that I give a damn and that I am doing this for myself. I am just tired. Tired of trying and doing and doing it all. Maybe instead of the elliptical I need to do boxing workouts LOL. Anywho I had to get that off my chest so I can stop brooding and just move on with the day.\nWell thankfully I pulled myself out of my funk yesterday. I did make it to the gym for a really good workout but it was funny because I got to the gym and quickly realized that I had forgotten my socks and well in the mood that I was already in I for a split second thought about not working out and just going back up to my desk but I was like, no I have to do this, so I did my workout without my socks and was so glad that I did because it just helped me get over myself and the feelings that I was having and to just get myself back on track. This journey is going to be a long slow and painful process but it just has to keep going. I have to completely accept that this is my lot in life and that even though it is not easy I have to do it and get healthy or it is going to be a short and miserable life.\nI seriously don't get it, and think my scales officially hate me. I have worked so hard this week and have been good on my food and I just don't understand why I have not lost anything, not even a pound. I am hoping that it is just because that I have had TOM again this week for the second time this month.\nI have decided that if the scales aren't moving something has to be changing so I took measurements of my whole body, or at least the parts I care about LOL I just wish I had done that when I started this process. So the embarrassing numbers are below and I will measure again next week.\nI have also increased my cardio workout to 40 minutes on the elliptical and I have been able to increase it to 3 miles total while maintaining a heart rate average of 150 for 30 of the 40 minutes. So I know I am getting stronger because I have to work harder to get my heart rate up and keep it up. I am also in the processing finding a new house, I viewed one last night and fell in love with it, but so did lots of other people so I am putting it out in the universe that if this is meant to be then it will happen and be easy. PLease be easy, I am tired of having to struggle through everything LOL.\nMan these numbers don't lie and sure do make me feel like a whale. But you know I honestly don't feel that way most of the time, most of the time I feel like I am smaller than I am, and I am ok until I look at a picture or I look in the mirror. It messes with my head sometimes but I haven't given up yet. If though I go through another week without any loss then I am going to have to change my food again and I don't know how much smaller I can on my food, because I need some food, I can't get by on just veggies lol. Anyways I have a ton to do this weekend with cleaning and packing and looking for houses ( just in case the one from last night falls through). So take care all and thank you for reading.\nLast edited by jenfett; 06-25-2011 at 10:40 AM.\nWell I let what usually happens happen...I let stress get in the way of what I was working towards. Lost all motivation, starting eating like crazy, and I didn't stop me, neither did anyone else. I even stopped coming here, actually I think the 25th of June was the last time I logged in. Its all in my head, I know, I just don't know how to deal with stress or not speaking my mind in any other way than hurting myself. It comes so easy for some, but not me. Whatever it may be, I need to cut the strings and get over it, I need to become a totally different person, I need to become me. I am too busy trying to do and be what everyone else wants me to be that I have never learned who I am and what I want in my life. I don't love myself and never really have. I am told that I am a very negative person, always depressed, and think everything stinks. Partly this is true, and while I don't know 100% of the cause I certain know a few key things that are causing most of my grief, and if I would just learn to open my mouth and say what is on my mind or hurting me or what I disagree with then I think I can start making the changes in my life that will help me get to a different level. I fear though hurting anyone's feeling and most people don't like people to disagree with them so I always walk on eggshells and worry about what people think and I just internalize everything, so on top of my weight I have years and years worth of pent up feelings that don't go anywhere but eat away at me everyday. Sometimes I wish I could just be a *****, that would make it so much easier because I wouldn't care what anyone thought.\nAt any rate I just needed to talk that out and at least not have that floating around my head. I went back to the gym today, didn't want to but I did. I will get back on track. I am a person who needs help that is for darn sure, maybe some day I will figure it all out, hopefully sooner rather than later.",

    "text": "What Impact Will a 9% Drop in Profits Have On Your Organization?\nUnless your Supply Management organization takes it to the next level, your company is facing a 9% drop in corporate profits this year due to rising prices and other inflationary pressure according to a recent Hackett Group study. For a typical Global 1000 company with 27.8 billion in revenue, Hackett\u2019s study estimated that commodity and offshore labor inflation will drive a 150 million per year hit to the bottom line. Ouch!\nWhy? While most companies are now able to effectively anticipate commodity price increases, more than 60% of companies surveyed by Hackett in the recent study have not been successful at mitigating these cost increases. The reality is that few executives have experienced significant inflation, which is now at levels not seen in 30 years (when inflation rates hovered around 13% back in 1981).\nAnd while inflation may not yet be at 13%, it is bad. Not only do respondents to the Hackett study expect the rate of inflation for commodities overall to rise by more than 30%, to 6.3% a year, but commodity price volatility has increased nearly 60% since before the recession. Making matters worse, at the same time, due to the talent crunch, the rate for internal labor is expected to more than triple from 0.7% to 2.2% and the rate of inflation for external labor is expected to more than double from 1.2% to 3%.\nThis entry was posted in Analyst, Economics on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nRegular readers of SI will know the importance of good should-cost modeling (which is also great for negotiations) as well as good market intelligence (which has dimensions and is valuable in a down economy) in cost reduction and avoidance. And while both should-cost modelling and market intelligence have a number of critical requirements that must be met for success, they both have one key requirement in common \u2014 good data. But where do you get good data? Certainly not from supplier bids! A new supplier is going to bid what it thinks it can get, not what the actual price is. Market indices from governments and professional associations? Better, but they will typically be at least a month or so behind. Trade associations that track and monitor prices on a daily basis or stock markets that trade the commodity? Great \u2014 but do you have the IT skills to integrate the feeds? And are you going to do it for the dozens of raw materials and commodities you need to build your should cost models?\nTo help their clients understand the data, Mintec provides a data analysis package, called Datagain, which can be used to import, graph, analyze, and compare different line items (such as the petrol price in the UK and the petrol price in Australia, normalized to US dollars). A user can graph any set of series, against any frequency, using any (currency and unit) converions, for any date range she chooses. She can also normalize or index this data using a custom formula, factor in seasonality, and plot trends. She can also break the series down across two or four graphs and/or plot specific subseries, against different projections, to see how the price might trend over time under different assumptions. The normalization / indexing equations can use all of the standard algebraic operators and be defined over any set of variables, including user defined variables, that the user chooses.\nIf the user is not sophisticated at trend analysis, or does not want to do it, Mintec also offers Benchmarking and Market (Intelligence) Report services that do a deep dive into a particular raw material, commodity, or service that discuss recent, current, and projected pricing subject to the state of the market and the dominant factors at play. These, by request, reports complement the monthly market reports and commodity fact sheets that track the major commodities and markets and their relative month-over-month changes for buyers who want to look at the bigger picture. If the user wants to learn more about Datagain, analysis, and should-cost modeling, Mintec also provides on-demand out-of-the-box and customized training sessions as well as quarterly newsletters and occasional articles.\nIt\u2019s a huge amount of data, that comes at a very low price point. Most customers pay less than 100K \u00a3s for access to the data they need, when they need it, updated as often as they like. Moreover, medium-sized business can get basic access (to the datafeeds) and access to the desktop Datagain tool for as little as 10K \u00a3s a year. Large enterprises will probably want the on-line hosted applet version (at the higher price-point) that runs through the browser on a hosted database that is accessible anywhere, anytime, and always up to date. While it is more expensive, it\u2019s still cheap compared to what the organization will be paying for their ERP solution (and much more valuable from a cost avoidance perspective).\nThis entry was posted in Best Practices, Market Intelligence on June 30, 2011 by thedoctor.\nTMS Requires 100 Million, Does ERP Require 1 Billion?\nBen Pivar, Vice President and North American Supply Chain Lead for Capgemini regarding Transportation Management Systems (TMS) Pivar says that the economics of installing a TMS package on a client server, for example, doesn\u2019t really work until you have nearly $100 million in freight spend and that\u2019s why on-demand is so popular in that space.\nSI has to agree. Unless a firm has tens of millions in freight spend, the costs of installation, maintenance, and usage tend to dwarf the benefits of using a TMS system. However, what\u2019s even more important to note is that enterprise ERP (from a top vendor) is, on average, at least five, if not (usually) ten times, more expensive to install, integrate, maintain, and use than TMS. This would seem to indicate that the economics of traditional ERP don\u2019t make sense unless your company has 1 Billion in spend, or at least 1 Billion in revenue. In other words, unless you\u2019re a member of the Fortune 2000 or Global 3000, traditional end-to-end on-premise enterprise ERP is probably not for you. And it would appear that Oracle, one of the largest players, tends to agree. Why do you think it has advertisements stating it has 98% of the Fortune 500? It\u2019s not just because the Fortune X, it\u2019s target market, provide it with its biggest deals. It\u2019s because Oracle also understands that unless a company has reached a critical mass, given the cost of the system, the company won\u2019t get the advertised return (which is a key to keeping the company as a high-paying customer year after year).\nHowever, every organization needs a good transaction store and data repository as analysis is key to supply management success. So what does this mean if you\u2019re not one of the lucky ones? Don\u2019t look at a a tradtional on-premise end-to-end ERP from a big boy. Look at either a newer, smaller, slimmed down offering from a smaller player, possibly based on an open-source solution (like Compiere), a suite from a provider that maintains its own transaction store, or a newer, slimmed down, SaaS offering from a traditional provider that can integrate with some BoB solutions in the cloud and offer an effective hybrid solution. Just don\u2019t go for the billion-dollar solution, because your organization likely won\u2019t get a return from the millions it will cost.\nThis entry was posted in Inventory, Logistics, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nCheck out the live debate in two hours (@ 2pm EDT) between Paul Martyn, VP of Supply Strategy at BravoSolution, and Howard Coleman, principal of MCA Associates, to find out.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.\nAs per yesterday\u2019s post, it\u2019s been less than five months since we last checked in with Trade Extensions, who had traded up to a Fact Sheet User Interface and added a slew of new features, including improved RFI support, multi-dimensional rankings in e-Negotiation, Google Earth integration, new incumbent rules, and an OLAP foundation to reporting, including the implementation of a new n-way comparison report. Since then, Trade Extensions has been on a tear to add new functionality as fast as it can to make the platform not only one of the most powerful expressive bidding optimization platforms on the planet, but also one of the easiest to use \u2014 listening to its users (which include the Fortune 1000) and adding features and functions that make an average buyer\u2019s life easier, taking usability to a whole new level yet again. And while earth-shattering technology improvements are cool, it is usability that is the ultimate key to to adoption, use, and, ultimately, cost avoidance and reduction in your sourcing organization.\nNot only are there new rules that allow partial awards to be fixed based upon existing scenarios, but the number of constraint categories has doubled. While there were only general and incumbent constraints in the past, there are now an entire category of scenario reference rules and post processing rules. With respect to scenario reference rules, not only can allocations be kept, but bids can be favoured or penalized as well. The post-processing rules are also quite useful. Allocations can automatically be rounded and allocations that don\u2019t meet a minimum number of units can be removed (or re-assigned to the supplier who meets a minimum allocation with the lowest total cost).\nThe buyer now has fine-grained control over what the supplier sees, and can even mix feedback types. For example, if the buyer only wants the top three suppliers to know they are top three, but suppliers four to six to know their exact rank, they can specify that specific rank starts at bidder four, and the top bidders default to \u201ctop 3\u201d. In addition, if the supplier does not meet a minimum bid increment, which can be defined in a number of ways (including, minimum dollar or % decrease over last bid), the supplier gets a nice red error that the bid is not acceptable AND a message indicating the minimum increment required. Finally, and this is really cool, the user can define custom color-coded bid feedback fields based on dynamic formulas that now only let the user know where they rank, but how competitive their bid is (against the current bids from the competition) in English using a buyer defined scale such as \u201cCompetitive\u201d, \u201cSlightly Competitive\u201d, \u201cNot Competitive\u201d, and \u201cNot Acceptable\u201d.\nPlus, the buyer can now chat with users online in an integrated IM client, and immediately see who is online when they log in as it is a widget on their project management dashboard.\nThe \u201cdashboards\u201d for RFX and auction phases have also improved. The summary, bidder summary, and lot summary are now completely customizeable by the user, support custom fields, and user-defined colour codings in the rankings. In addition, there is integrated show/hide, drill-down functionality, and customizeable pop-up (bid, trend, and bidder activity) charts where a user can select one, some, or all of the rows in each report.\nAll and all, it\u2019s a lot of new functionality in a short time frame that makes the tool extremely useable by an average buyer.\nThis entry was posted in Decision Optimization, Spend Analysis, Technology on June 29, 2011 by thedoctor.",

    "text": "Mortgage insurance typically cost around 1% of the total loan amount, every year.\nThis 20% of your mortgage is not a small amount and you may not have it saved already. If you have the money saved already, this article is not for you.\nYou try to save the amount or borrow it from someone else or borrow it from your own retirement fund.\nThe first step is to absolutely work the numbers and figure out your budget. While this is not an actual savings tactic, it\u2019s a crucial step in the process because it gives you a concrete goal to work towards.\nKnowing this number makes it a real goal and clears up the confusion and vagueness of having some idea of some large dollar amount, that\u2019s probably unattainable anyway. Remember, half the battle is gaining mental clarity and setting the goal.\nRemember, half the battle is gaining mental clarity and setting the goal.\nStep 2 \u2013 Then use a home-buying calculator to plug in your numbers, and it will give you a better sense of how big of a home you can afford.\nZillow\u2019s mortgage calculator is pretty helpful in helping you find this number.\nStep 3 \u2013 To know how your potential creditors think you\u2019re capable of handling, get pre-qualified. Do not look for a $500,000 home if you are pre-qualified for only $300,000. This is a reality-check step.\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say we did our budgeting and used the calculator to figure out that you can afford and qualified for a $500,000 home, so your down payment savings goal should be $100,000.\nNow consider these tips to save up.\nNow you can start to plan how much money you should really put aside each month.\nYou\u2019ll also get a better idea of how long it will take to reach your goal. If you\u2019re on the five-year plan, that means you\u2019ll need to save an extra $20,000 a year.\nDon\u2019t panic, just break it down further. An extra $20,000 a year is about $1,700 a month, which sounds way less intimidating.\nKeep in mind you\u2019ll still need to continue saving for your emergency fund, IRA, and paying down debt.\nYou\u2019ve heard this from me again and again: get a side gig, make extra money, work overtime, increase your income!\nIt sounds like generic advice but there\u2019s a reason why experts dish out the same advice: it\u2019s because earning extra money is a lot easier than drastically changing your lifestyle to scrimp and save.\nGoing this route is just not realistic or sustainable. Pinching pennies is not going to get you closer to the $1,700 each month, but increasing your income will.\nThis is going to take research on your part, but it\u2019ll be worth it \u2014 just imagine how you will enjoy your dream house, and what the extra income will afford you.\nThe best way to start is to make a list of what you\u2019re good at, and if you can leverage and outsource those skills during your free time to make that $1,700.\nOne of the items that your mortgage lender will look at is your overall DTI (debt-to-income) ratio.\nIf you\u2019re carrying a lot of credit card debt, you might want to look into a personal loan to consolidate and lower your payment. Debt consolidation loans can help you have a single monthly payment at a fixed rate.\nNot only does this help you eliminate debt faster, but it can help increase your credit score by up to 40 points according to Payoff.\nIf you\u2019re able to reduce your monthly payment and increase your score, you\u2019ll be in great shape to qualify for a mortgage.\nAfter you establish that, any kind of extra money that comes in during the year goes straight into that fund.\nThis includes any bonus from your employer, tax refunds, Christmas bonuses, gifts, inheritances, lottery, gambling win, etc.\nA 20 percent savings goal may be discouraging, especially if you have zero saved, but it can be done \u2014 all you need is a concrete plan and a savings mentality.\nThese methods are tried by people I know.\nTry to find alternative areas where housing is cheaper and your present savings allow for you to buy a home there, instead of the dream location you previously thought about.\nIf you have valuable property elsewhere then sell it to arrange for mortgage down payment. This includes inherited valuables, foreign real estate, etc.\nPutoff savings in your retirement fund for a couple of years. Redirect this fund to your home buying fund.\nIf all else fails, then go for mortgage insurance by paying only a small % of the loan, typically 5% only. But, be prepared to spend extra $100-$300 per month on mortgage insurance. You can start repaying the loan faster and as soon as cross the 20% ownership criteria, opt out of that insurance.\nStart with determining how much down payment is required for your need, your credit and home location. Then divide the number by the months you\u2019re willing to wait. Once you have the monthly savings goal, start by aggressively saving that amount from your monthly budget or increase side income.\nYou can also bring in additional money from selling some of your valuable stuff to reach your goal early. You can also consider lowering your goal by opting for a smaller home, different location. If you fail in your goal, down pay a lesser amount and opt for mortgage insurance.\nReaders, let us know how you saved for mortgage down payment.",

    "text": "Adweek: So what\u2019s a digital-media tyro like you doing at a fusty old-media company like CBS?\nJim Lanzone: I don\u2019t really think of it that way at all. People think the Internet will supercede TV, but it\u2019s really been more additive than anything else, largely because it\u2019s so portable. It\u2019s not taking anything away from linear television; if anything, it\u2019s encouraged people to spend even more time watching video.\nAW: The fact that we can watch TV on a telephone: is this doing something insidious to the parts of our brain that process narrative?\nJL: Think about the very early days of TV\u2014the first shows were structured just like radio broadcasts or Broadway shows. You start with the familiar and you expand from there. Creative people haven\u2019t taken advantage of the new media platforms; we\u2019re still in this brackish time between two eras.\nAW: You still watch TV?\nJL: I\u2019m a binge watcher. I have DirecTV, so I have a ton of shows on the DVR: The Daily Show, [Real Time With] Bill Maher, SNL. I\u2019ve been watching How I Met Your Mother for six years. There are definitely more shows out there that I want to watch that I don\u2019t have time to watch, which I suppose is a great sign of where programming is headed.\nAW: Why did CBS issue a fatwa against Hulu?\nAW: Can you write code?\nJL: I never got into programming when I was a kid. I was too busy playing Pitfall and Kaboom! on Atari to write code. But then again, I don\u2019t think Les Moonves knows how to make a television set either.\nAW: So there\u2019s no disconnect between the old media centers\u2014New York, L.A.\u2014and Silicon Valley?\nJL: Well, you\u2019re looking at it from a geographic standpoint and that really isn\u2019t relevant any longer. I think Silicon Valley is the third leg of the media stool; I mean, there\u2019s a reason why all the animated features are made in Silicon Valley now. Engineers are the new artists of this generation of media.\nAW: Are you from Silicon Valley?\nJL: I grew up in San Carlos, where Oracle now stands. In fact, they built Oracle on the old Marine World site. George Lucas used some of the elephants from Marine World in Star Wars, and after it came out\u2014I must have seen it 25 times that summer\u2014they started offering Bantha rides at Marine World.\nAW: Speaking of which, what the hell happened to George Lucas? Those three Star Wars prequels were just god-awful.\nJL: I know what happened to George Lucas: the \u201880s. If movies peaked in the \u201870s, then it\u2019s fair to say that the 2000s is the Renaissance period for TV. The new Battlestar [Galactica] was at least a thousand times better than the old one. And I almost didn\u2019t watch it at first because I was afraid it was going to ruin my childhood memories of the original.",

    "text": "I had another debate with my friend again regarding the cost of living in Singapore. Naturally, we referred to the article below, titled \"Inflation could hit 5% early next year, then taper off\", and argued about the notion of \"spending less = lower cost of living = lower standard of living?\".\nMr Lim, Singapore\u2019s Minister for Trade and Industry, commented that by spending on alternative, cheaper goods, we can effectively lower the cost of living. However, some people seem to interpret that as lowering the standard of living.\nInstead of saying that \u201cswitching to cheaper products can reduce the cost of living\u201d, Minister Lim would have been more accurate to say, \u201cswitching to cheaper products can lower the standard of living\u201d. For example, instead of living in a 5-room HDB flat, you can live in a 1-room HDB flat (a cheaper product). Instead of having chicken rice and vegetables for lunch, you can just eat plain porridge (a cheaper product).\nLiving in a 1-room HDB flat and eating plain porridge constitutes a lower standard of living. So yes, by switching to cheaper products, you can lower your standard of living. And a lower standard of living does cost less to maintain.\nMy friend shared the perception that, by spending on (possibly) lower quality (and hence cheaper) goods, there will be less demand for the costlier goods. Given such a scenario, it is possible for the costlier goods to cost cheaper since the demand is now lowered. After all, economics is all about demand and supply \u2013 and hence Mr Lim\u2019s advice is not entirely wrong.\nHe also added that, it is not possible for everyone to stop spending \u2013 so people should spend less \u2013 perhaps on cheaper products, but not entirely stop spending because the entire economy will collapse. Thus to prevent either extremes from happening \u2013 (i) goods getting costlier (ii) economy collapsing, Singaporeans have to start spending moderately so that both goals become achievable.\nFrom the point of economics, I have to agree with his points. However, the entity that we are talking about are humans, and not robots, and so a greater amount of PR has to be injected while getting people to face reality.\nMr Lim had been infamous for his statements when he was the health minister, which includes asking the women to \"save on one hairdo and use the money for breast screening\", his regret in intervening to admit a premature baby to KKH to save the baby\u2019s life because \"\u2026in the end, the baby continued to be in intensive care, and KKH now runs up a total bill of more than $300,000\u2026\", and his call to raise hospital rates to hotel rates because \"if these patients (hospital overstayers) want to treat hospitals like a hotel, then they\u2019ll have to be charged hotel rates.\", of whom mostly are likely to be older than 60, with no income, or are from families with incomes below $1000.\nAS CONSUMER prices continue to rise, inflation in Singapore will likely surge to 4 or 5 per cent in the first quarter of next year.\nBut it should taper off by the second half of the year to \u2018more normal conditions\u2019, said Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang yesterday.\nThe average rate for next year should be around 3 per cent.\nFuelled mainly by rising global oil and food prices, inflation recorded a 13-year high of 2.9 per cent in August. It is expected to dip to 2.7 per cent in the last quarter, Mr Lim told Parliament.\nBut it was his 2008 forecast that made analysts and consumers sit up yesterday.\nCitigroup economist Chua Hak Bin said that the 5 per cent rate predicted would be a \u2018historic high\u2019 in the 25 years since 1983. The previous high was in July 1991, when it hit 4 per cent.\nMost economies, including Singapore\u2019s, size up inflation by tracking the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The CPI measures the cost of a basket of goods and services consumed by most households.\nYesterday, Mr Lim cautioned against \u2018interpreting a rise in the headline CPI as necessarily reflecting an increase in the cost of living\u2019.\nIt depends on the individual household\u2019s spending. \u2018Switching to cheaper products can reduce the cost of living despite a rise in the CPI,\u2019 he added.\nA CPI increase may also not reflect actual hikes in consumer prices. For instance, flat prices soared, but flat owners do not pay rent.\nHigher inflation, he said, should also be viewed against rapid economic growth, with the gross domestic product rising more than 6 per cent on average since 2003 and wages also on the up.\nHowever, MPs such as Madam Halimah Yacob worry that residents, especially the elderly on fixed incomes, are feeling the pinch. \u2018They go to the market with a similar sum of money. But they can buy less,\u2019 she said.\nHe sketched out how the landscape will look like next year.\nExplaining why there will be a spike in inflation before it plateaus, he cited two reasons: First, it is as compared to the first quarter of this year, when inflation was at 0.5 per cent and oil prices were low.\nSecond, the \u2018one-off\u2019 effect of the goods and services tax hike, which will be felt until next June.\nThereafter, the trend will \u2018revert to more normal conditions in the second half of next year\u2019.\nThe numbers come against a global backdrop of rising oil and food prices, such as more expensive chicken due to costlier feed. Adverse weather in food-supplying countries has also reduced supply, even as demand has risen.\nDiversifying sources is one way to maintain more stable food prices, Mr Lim said, but there was a limit to this given the worldwide increase in food prices being seen now.\nBut inflation has not affected Singapore\u2019s economic competitiveness, he said.\n\u2018We are tracking our competitiveness position very closely and so far we are in quite a good position,\u2019 he said, adding that inflation here was lower than in other countries.\nHe noted that imported inflation has been reduced because of the policy of gradually appreciating the Singapore dollar.\nOther watchers suggest more aggressive measures. Citigroup\u2019s Dr Chua, for instance, believes that the economy is in danger of overheating.\nHe called on the Government to re-prioritise projects, given that unemployment is already at a low.\nPrevious: Plans for today (like who will bother).. haha..",

    "text": "After years of turbulence, the F-35 together with other developments such as UAV\u2019s will redefine the application of Air Power for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. The program has progressed to such an extent that the fielding forces are preparing for operational capability. In June 2013, the United States Marine Corps and Air Force declared their intention to field early Initial Operational Capability with Block 2B software in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In support of the decision, General Amos, The Commandant of The Marine Corps, stated that it \u201cwill provide an airplane that will deliver more weapons, be more capable, be stealthier, have more capabilities, more information assurance, more information dominance, than anything we\u2019re flying today in the United States Marine Corps\u201d.\nTo understand the F-35 as it exists today, it\u2019s valuable to examine the origins of the program. In the early 1990\u2019s, the United States Department of Defense launched a tri-service combat aircraft recapitalisation program called the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The intent of the program was to leverage recent major investments by the U.S. in technology, introduce true service interoperability and achieve economies of commonality and scale as legacy combat aircraft fleets were to be replaced. The ongoing U.S. National Security strategy to require coalition based operations had also revealed significant capability gaps between the equipment utilised by U.S. and allied air forces.\nComponent Commanders were impacted by these shortfalls and a decision was made to allow participation by selected allied nations in the development and procurement of the JSF. Seven additional NATO countries (U.K., Netherlands, Italy, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Turkey) and key NATO partner Australia were asked by the U.S. to join the program following the contract award in October of 2001. These relationships were codified in formal bi-lateral Government to Government agreements for the initial stage.\nThe joint capability and industrial tenets established by the F-35 Program are a precursor to the Smart Defence Initiative embraced by the Alliance in 2012. From their public position on the topic, NATO has stated that \u201c\u2026 the other Allies must reduce the gap with the U.S. by equipping themselves with capabilities that are deemed to be critical, deployable and sustainable, and must demonstrate political determination to achieve that goal. There must be equitable sharing of the defence burden. Smart defence is NATO\u2019s response to this.\u201d The world financial crisis since 2008 serves to reinforce the value, efficiency, and priority of the F-35 Program in executing this NATO initiative to confront crisis management in the immediate future.\nGo deep into a double digit Surface to Air Missile (SAM) threat environment to destroy moving and mobile targets through the weather while outnumbered by advanced fighters equipped with advanced air-to-air weapons. Perform the mission from any base and at a lower cost than legacy programs.\nTo achieve these goals, the F-35 program pursued a more highly integrated NATO industrial base to maximise the capabilities of the Alliance. The international design and manufacturing aspects of the program, however, diverge from traditional offset mentalities, which are in comparison inefficient, costly, and historically limited to only those airplanes being purchased by that specific nation. The F-35 program introduced a new economic model based on \u2018competitive best value\u2019 where industrial concerns in each of the partner countries were allowed to compete and win work on F-35. As long as competitive cost and quality standards are maintained, the industries of the partner nations are allowed to supply parts for each aircraft produced. Significant outreach work was done by the US industry team supported by the various US agencies to help align the world class capabilities of the NATO industrial base with JSF opportunities. All eight partner countries produced parts flown on the first test airplane and continue to produce components today.\nWith the test fleet now surpassing 5,000 total flights, confidence in the maturity of the program is intensifying as the typical technical problems faced by a developmental program of this size have been resolved as they have arisen. While risk remains in the program, it is expected that emerging issues will continue to be solved as their predecessors were.\nSignificant numbers of aircraft have been produced as well. To date, 235 tails have either been delivered or are on order. The first partner country, the United Kingdom, is operating three training jets at Eglin Air Base. The second partner country, the Netherlands, has two aircraft flying that will be used for Operational Test & Evaluation. The common training facilities, established first at Eglin AFB and coming online at Luke AFB in 2013, embody the principles of NATO\u2019s Connected Forces Initiative, providing \u201coverarching collective training so that Allies can come together and be ready for any eventuality\u201d and \u201cbetter use of technology [as] a key means to facilitate the ability of Allied and partner forces to work together\u201d. By 2018, 416 F-35s are projected to be delivered to NATO countries with an estimated 49 aircraft operating in Europe.\nEight of the nine F-35 partner nations are members of NATO and the aircraft will be the backbone of future air operations. The F-35 will provide capabilities throughout NATO that are currently uniquely held by the U.S. In Operations Allied Force, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Odyssey Dawn, the denied access missions were conducted by the U.S. stealth platforms F-117 and B-2. With the F-35, the ability to penetrate advanced enemy Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) will be extended to this core function of NATO.\nThe coalition force has additionally relied on the EA-18G Growlers of the United States Navy to provide Electronic Attack (EA) against the SAM systems. With the F-35, high gain EA missions can be executed by multiple nations with their indigenous capability. The possession of advanced stealth and EA by a large number of NATO countries will significantly increase the effectiveness of a coalition across a wide range of crisis management operations.\nUnlike its 5th generation brethren, the F-22, the F-35 was designed from the outset to bring these capabilities while also being interoperable across a coalition of air power. Two networks are core to this operability: the Link-16 and the new Multi-Function Advanced Datalink (MADL). These data links will allow the F-35 to communicate with all current and future NATO assets. The Link-16 connection is currently utilised by the existing platforms fielded by NATO and will allow F-35 to integrate seamlessly into the coalition force structure. MADL will complement the current networks with NATO\u2019s first high bandwidth, low probability of detect and intercept connection. The fundamental design features of MADL will enable all NATO F-35s in a deployed coalition to communicate within an Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2AD) environment.\nNATO operations in a permissive environment such as Afghanistan will see benefits as well from the addition of the F-35. With its impressive sensor suite, net centric design, and ability to carry more than 18,000 lbs of payload when loaded externally, the F-35 can be thought of as a 5th generation Strike Eagle: the advanced avionics of an F-22 combined with the range payload that nearly matches that of an F-15E. This allows the F-35 to shape a crisis throughout the conflict, beginning with the removal of the enemy IADS and continuing until the final day of sorties.\nWithout the context of the current threat environment, it can be difficult to understand the necessity of the capabilities of the F-35. Reviewing Operation Unified Protector may be the best way to understand how the F-35 will change the way NATO confronts future challenges. In support of the rebels against Gaddafi\u2019s regime, NATO established a no-fly zone over the contested region and dramatically shifted the outcome of the nation. With only the application of airpower, NATO was able to manage the crisis without deploying large numbers of ground forces.\nThis relatively limited conflict required a force of greater than 160 tactical aircraft from thirteen coalition countries. The threat posed by the Libyan forces was predominantly equipment procured prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall: legacy SA-2, SA-3, SA-5, and SA-6 single digit SAM systems complimented by aging Mirage F1s, Mig-21s, and MiG-23s. The minimal threat posed by the regime in Libya will likely be encountered by NATO forces significantly less often in the future and replaced with advanced systems.\nIn both quantity and quality, highly advanced eastern threat systems have proliferated significantly in the world market. Today\u2019s SAM systems are built on digital, networked sensors that can track hundreds of targets simultaneously. The engagement zone has been extended to distances exceeding 125 miles while attacking multiple targets simultaneously. Navalised versions of these same SAMs further extend the threat zone beyond the coast.\nIn the world fighter market, advanced 4th generation fighters are the minimal capability pursued by militaries and have become a commodity. Fighters containing electronically scanned radars, long range active missiles, infrared search and track sensors, and sophisticated jamming systems are now commonplace throughout the world. The resulting effectiveness of these threat fighters places NATO forces at parity.\nThe combination of advanced surface and air threats pose a real challenge to the ability of NATO\u2019s forces to provide sufficient conventional deterrence. The threat environment will continue to become more complex and advanced as Russia and China prepare to export multiple 5th Generation platforms products on the world market. When stealth air frames become the standard capability of the air forces of the world, the threat posed by foreign militaries will shift drastically upward.\nSyria is a prime example of what NATO forces might face in the future. Political concerns aside, the defence capability of the established Syrian government dwarfs that of Libya in both quantity and quality. The Syrian airforce has 2.5 times the number of fighters that were seen in Libya, among them advanced MiG-29 fighters. These fighters have to defend a country that is 1 / 10th the size of Libya. In addition, other parties may decide to support Syria with additional aircraft to further strengthen their air force.\nThe Syrian fighters are supplemented by a robust, dense SAM network. Compared to Libya, the Syrian IADS has more than 4 times the number of missile launchers and a missile density almost fifty times greater than the previous operation. Recent purchases of tactical double digit SAMs have reinforced their defensive posture. The potential transfer of strategic double digit SAMs would further fortify this posture.\nThe aggregation of the number of threat systems and their innate quality complicates the ability of any coalition of (NATO) forces to establish a no-fly zone and deter the regime. It would likely require double the number of assets deployed against Libya with no guarantee of success. This facet of the conflict has reduced the effectiveness of the political pressures. As advanced threat systems proliferate, conflicts in a high threat environment will likely become the rule instead of the exception.\nThe F-35 is not just set to reinvent airpower for NATO, it\u2019s positioned to have a strong presence in the force for at least the next thirty years. Designed with power and cooling capacity that far exceeds the aircraft that it will be replacing, the F-35 will continue to provide significant opportunities for capability growth throughout its life cycle. This capacity combined with the open architecture of the F-35 will enable rapid integration of future avionics and increases in computing power. Simultaneously, the lethality of the F-35 will be improved. An existing effort to increase the carriage of AIM-120s to six in the internal bay will allow the F-35 to further extend its dominance in air-air engagements. Longer term, the development of 5th generation weapons such as Cuda will create an unmatched combination of air vehicle and air-air missile. Originally unveiled at the Air Force Technology Expo in 2012, the medium range hit-to-kill missile will expand the beyond visual range engagement zone while more than doubling the internal capacity of the F-35. It is expected that kinematic weapons of today will give way to the directed energy (DE) weapons of tomorrow, first as a defensive mechanism before potentially growing into an offensive weapon. Again, the power and cooling capacity of the F-35 could enable this transition.\nTo enable NATO\u2019s essential purpose of safeguarding freedom, the members of the Alliance need to maintain a credible conventional deterrence capability. Currently, this capability is eroding due to the proliferation of advanced threats and is under increased pressure from the financial crisis. The procurement of F-35 will help to safeguard this aspect for NATO and ensure the viability of diplomatic efforts as the first measure to prevent future conflicts. Once established as the backbone of NATO airpower, the growth capabilities of the F-35 will ensure that this capability will not erode for years to come.",

    "text": "Any speed over the speed of sound, which is approximately 343 m/s, 1,087 ft/s, 761 mph or 1,225 km/h in air at sea level, is said to be supersonic. Speeds greater than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes referred to as hypersonic.\nSound can be considered simply as a plane pressure disturbance in an elastic medium. As such sound will travel at different speeds in different mediums, mostly depending on the molecular mass and temperature of the medium in which the sound propagates; pressure has a very much smaller effect. Since air temperature and composition varies significantly with altitude, supersonic speeds for aircraft are given at sea level. In water at room temperature supersonic can be considered as any speed greater than 1,440 m/s or 4,724 ft/s.\nMany modern fighter aircraft are supersonic. The Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144 were supersonic passenger aircraft. But, since Concorde's final retirement flight on November 26 2003, there are no supersonic passenger aircraft left in service.\nMost modern firearm munitions are supersonic, with rifle projectile often travelling at speeds approaching Mach 3.\nIn 1942 the United Kingdom's Ministry of Aviation began a top secret project with the Miles Aircraft to develop the world's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier. The project resulted in the development of the prototype Miles M.52 aircraft, which was designed to reach 1000 mph (1600 km/h) at 36,000 feet (11 km) in 1 minute 30 seconds.\nThe aircraft's design was revolutionary introducing many innovations which are still used on today's supersonic aircraft. The single most important development was the all-moving tailplane which allowed control to be maintained at supersonic speeds; this was the brainchild of Dennis Bancroft and his team at Miles Research. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled by the Director of Scientific Research, Sir Ben Lockspeiser, before any manned fights were conducted. Subsequently, on government orders, all design data and research regarding the Miles M.52 was sent to BELL aircraft in the USA. There was supposed to be data exchange in both directions, but allegedly, after receiving the British data, the American government blocked the deal.\nLater experimentation on the Miles M.52 design proved that the aircraft would indeed have broken the sound barrier, with an unmanned 3/10 scale replica of the M.52 achieving Mach 1.5 in October 1948.\nChuck Yeager was the first man to break the sound barrier in level flight on October 14 1947, flying the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach 1 at an altitude of 45,000 feet (13.7 km).\nA team led by Richard Noble and driver Andy Green became the first to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle, called the Thrust SuperSonicCar, on October 15 1997, almost exactly 50 years after Yeager's flight.\nHans Guido Mutke claimed to have broken the sound barrier before Yeager, on April 9 1945 in a Messerschmitt Me 262. However, this claim is disputed by most experts and lacks a scientific foundation.\nSupersonic aerodynamics are simpler than subsonic ones because the airsheets at different points along the plane doesn't know of each other. Subsonic air anticipates an airplane or an airfoil, supersonic air just jams into the shock-wave.\nOne can gently guide air around the fuselage of the aircraft without producing new shockwave, but any change in cross area further down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body.\nIt should be kept in mind, however, that the aerodynamic principles behind a supersonic aircraft are often more complex than described above due to the fact that such an aircraft must be efficient and stable at both supersonic, transonic and subsonic flight.\nThis page was last modified 08:56, 23 Jun 2005.",

    "text": "The courts don\u2019t expect your company\u2019s OHS program to be perfect. To make out a due diligence defence, your company must prove only that it made reasonable efforts to comply with the law and protect workers\u2019 health and safety. But the courts do expect you to take all reasonable steps toward compliance\u2014not just some steps.\n> Institute a formal hazard assessment for any work or activity in the areas where asbestos was present [R. v. Della Valle]. .\nThe OHS laws only require companies to protect workers from reasonably foreseeable hazards. The standard for determining whether a hazard was foreseeable is not what risks the company actually did foresee but what a reasonably prudent person in the same situation would have foreseen. If a safety incident or violation was foreseeable, the company will be held liable if it didn\u2019t take all reasonable steps to prevent the incident or violation.\nExample: A backhoe operator snagged a natural gas riser, causing gas to seep into a nearby butcher shop. The shop exploded, killing two people, seriously injuring five others and causing extensive property damage. The operator was convicted of two OHS violations. The court pointed out that the operator knew the risk of working around live gas lines and the potentially serious consequences of hitting a gas line with his backhoe. So doing so was clearly a foreseeable hazard. But the operator, who had plenty of time, didn\u2019t take reasonable steps to avoid snagging a gas line, such as carefully digging with a shovel to expose the riser. In short, the court called the operator\u2019s actions incredibly risky and the incident \u201centirely foreseeable\u201d [R. v. Riemer]. .\nIf a hazard was not only foreseeable but actually known to the company, failing to address it is fatal to successfully arguing that you exercised due diligence.\nExample #1: During blasting for a roadway construction project, flyrock showered a nearby trailer court, destroying a shed, crashing through a trailer\u2019s roof and forcing a tenant to run for safety. The contractor and a supervisor were convicted of OHS violations and appealed. In upholding their convictions, the court noted that they knew damage from blasting was foreseeable because a prior blast during this project had caused flyrock to reach the same trailer court, thus demonstrating what could happen if proper safety precautions weren\u2019t followed. The practical wisdom from that prior incident should\u2019ve \u201cinformed reasonableness and safe practice,\u201d said the court. It added, \u201cPast experience can be a reliable predictor of future incidents or damage\u201d [R. v. Government of Yukon].\nExample #2: A technology company held a customer appreciation event that featured a mechanical calf roping machine operated by the company\u2019s employees. The machine had a faulty spring. So the operator had to reach into it to manually release a hook. While a worker was doing so, he was hit in the back of the head by a steel lever and died. The appeals court pointed out that before the fatality, another worker operating the machine had been hit on the shoulder by the lever. So although the specific type of injury the worker who died suffered may not have been foreseen, the potential danger of being struck by this lever while reaching into the machine was a \u201creasonable prospect,\u201d explained the court. Once this hazard was detected, a reasonable employer would have discontinued use of the machine and not permitted untrained workers to operate it. But despite being aware of the potential dangers associated with the machine, the company allowed the continued use of this equipment [R. v. XI Technologies Inc.]. .\nYour company\u2019s safety rules and procedures must be in writing. Verbal safety procedures are too easily misunderstood, which can have serious\u2014and often fatal\u2014consequences. Written safety procedures that spell out exactly what\u2019s required and when are less likely to be misunderstood. As a result, courts will typically rule that due diligence requires written safety procedures.\nYes, your OHS program must include thorough, written safety rules and procedures. But that\u2019s not enough to prove due diligence. You must also properly train workers on those rules and procedures. And that training must be adequate.\nExample #1: In the Linamar case discussed above, the court ruled that the employer needed to develop not only a written policy on troubleshooting but also a related program for training workers on that policy.\nExample #2: A flagger working along a highway was run over by an excavator operated by a co-worker and crushed to death. His employer was convicted of, among other things, failing to provide proper training to workers at the site. The court found that although the employer provided some instruction and training to workers, it was minimal and not to the extent required to prove due diligence [R. v. Concord Paving Ltd.].\nProviding adequate training to workers isn\u2019t going to help you prove due diligence if you can\u2019t demonstrate that you provided such training. So you must document the nature and extent of the training the company provides its workers.\nExample #1: In the Concord Paving case discussed above, the court noted that the employer\u2019s OHS program manual contained a form for documenting the safety courses that workers took. But at trial, it didn\u2019t produce any such forms for the workers involved in the incident to prove that they\u2019d taken any safety courses.\nExample #2: A temporary worker for a salvage company fell approximately three metres from an opening in a wall onto a pile of pipe, suffering a broken leg and three broken ribs. The company was convicted of several safety violations. Among other factors that led to a finding of no due diligence, the court said that although the company claimed that it provided workers with a safety orientation, it had no documentation to prove that claim [R. v. Canadian Consolidated Salvage Ltd. (Clearway Recycling)].\nAs important as adequate training is, you must also ensure that workers are appropriately supervised while on the job in order to prove due diligence. That\u2019s because proper supervision is the best way to ensure workers are actually applying their training.\nExample: At a bridge construction project, a safety inspector saw workers working 20 to 50 feet above the ground without adequate fall protection in the form of guardrails or handrails. In addition, the workers were attached to a horizontal lifeline that wasn\u2019t properly engineered. The employer appealed its conviction for violating the fall protection and supervision requirements, pointing to the training it provided to workers on fall protection. But the Tribunal explained, \u201cTraining alone does not meet the requirements of due diligence, if there is not adequate supervision to ensure that the knowledge provided through training is being correctly and consistently applied\u201d [WCAT-2012-00224].\nAnd the need for appropriate supervision applies to all workers\u2014even those who are experienced.\nExample: During an inspection of a residential construction project, a safety officer saw an experienced journeyman carpenter working about 18 feet above the ground without his fall protection harness attached to a lifeline. The construction company was penalized for fall protection violations, which it appealed. The Tribunal acknowledged that the carpenter had more than 20 years\u2019 experience and was familiar with the fall protection requirements. In fact, he admitted that he should\u2019ve attached his harness to a lifeline. But the Tribunal noted that there was no evidence that he was properly supervised to ensure he complied with these requirements. It appears that the company simply opted to rely on his experience, training and knowledge [WCAT-2012-00416].\nCompanies have a duty to ensure that workers follow safety rules and procedures and comply with the OHS laws. To that end, you should take steps to convey to workers the importance of safety compliance\u2014and the ramifications of safety infractions. For example, when workers violate safety rules, you must discipline them.\nExample #1: At a residential construction site, a safety officer saw two workers, who were approximately 18 feet above the ground, not wearing fall protection harnesses. And there was no fall protection equipment on the roof. The construction company was penalized for a fall protection violation and appealed. The employer argued that it provided extensive training on fall protection requirements. But the Tribunal said the company\u2019s training and education efforts weren\u2019t sufficient for workers to understand the importance of complying with those requirements or the consequences of non-compliance. For example, the company didn\u2019t implement a progressive discipline program for safety infractions until after this incident [WCAT-2011-02413].\nExample #2: A safety officer inspecting a roofing project saw a worker and supervisor on a roof about 24 feet above the ground when neither was connected to a lifeline. During an inspection of another company worksite, two workers on a roof weren\u2019t connected to lifelines. The company was penalized for failing to comply with the fall protection requirements and provide adequate training and supervision. It appealed. The Tribunal said that although the company provided fall protection training and had a progressive discipline program for safety infractions, it knew that workers were ignoring the fall protection requirements. So it should\u2019ve realized that its efforts weren\u2019t preventing or deterring fall protection violations and done more, such as providing bonuses for safety compliance [WCAT-2011-02507].\nWhen a company is charged with a safety offence, it may try to point the finger at the workers involved, arguing that it took all reasonable steps and the workers simply disregarded safety protocol. Such an argument is unlikely to convince a court.\nExample #1: In WCAT-2011-02413 discussed above, the company argued that it was the independent actions of the workers that led to the violations, saying they forgot to put their fall protection equipment back on after their lunch break. The Tribunal noted that although the workers themselves could\u2019ve been hit with violations for their actions, their failure doesn\u2019t relieve the company of its duties under the OHS laws.\nExample #2: In Linamar, which was previously discussed, the employer argued that the worker got injured because he didn\u2019t use a spotter as required. But the court noted that the training wasn\u2019t clear as to the proper use of a spotter.\nBecause supervisors are responsible for ensuring that workers follow safety rules and comply with the OHS law, they should be held to a higher standard when it comes to safety infractions. So when a supervisor violates a safety rule, the consequences should be more severe than if a worker had committed the same infraction.\nExample: In WCAT-2011-02507 mentioned above, a worker and supervisor were seen by a safety inspector not wearing fall protection equipment when required. But the Tribunal said it wasn\u2019t apparent that the company held the supervisor more accountable for his actions than the worker, noting \u201cthe supervisor is responsible for setting an example to workers.\u201d In fact, the employer simply gave both a verbal warning.\nYou must ensure that workers are supervised by actual supervisors and not leave that responsibility to their co-workers.\nExample: A 22-year-old sawmill worker got caught in the pinchpoint of a canter machine and died. The sawmill was convicted of violating the supervision requirements. The Tribunal noted that the worker was young and had been on the job for less than a year. A supervisor had warned him before this incident about performing duties that weren\u2019t his own. Under these circumstances, he should\u2019ve been closely supervised but he wasn\u2019t. The fact that there were experienced and knowledgeable co-workers working in the same area as this worker wasn\u2019t a substitute for the presence of an actual supervisor. So the Tribunal concluded that the sawmill failed to satisfy its duty to provide adequate supervision [WCAT-2011-02783].\nIn general, employers can\u2019t avoid fulfilling their OHS duties by delegating them to someone else, such as a contractor or subcontractor.\nExample #1: In Canadian Consolidated Salvage, previously discussed, the company argued that the prime contractor was responsible for supervising all workers\u2014including the company\u2019s\u2014and complying with all safety requirements. So it had no duty to ensure the safety of its workers at that site. But the court said because the company was the injured worker\u2019s employer under the OHS laws, it was responsible for ensuring his safety at the site. And there was no evidence that the company took \u201cany steps whatsoever\u201d to protect its workers.\nExample #2: The contractor and supervisor in the Yukon case argued that hiring an experienced blaster relieved them of their duties under the OHS law. The court explained that the OHS law has \u201coverlapping obligations\u201d that mean everyone had a duty to ensure a safe blast. And there was no evidence that the contractor had a system in place to ensure that all blasting was done safely.\nThe same rule applies to suppliers who provide you with equipment and materials.\nExample: In the XI Technologies case, the company argued that it wasn\u2019t foreseeable that the supplier would provide it with an unsafe machine. In essence, the company assumed that the equipment would be safe to use. But the appeals court explained that the OHS law required the company, as an employer, to take reasonable steps to ensure that such equipment was, in fact, safe to operate as intended. And there were \u201crudimentary steps\u201d the company could\u2019ve taken to do so. For example, the company should\u2019ve asked the supplier for adequate operating instructions or a demonstration of the machine\u2019s proper use, especially considering that it was completely unfamiliar with this equipment. This relatively simple step would\u2019ve alerted operators to the fact that the machine wasn\u2019t working properly. But instead of getting instructions or a demonstration from the supplier, the company chose to rely on its untrained employees to figure out how to safely run the machine.\nCompanies must give workers the information they need to perform their jobs safely, such as MSDSs and safety signage. If that information is inaccurate, it\u2019s almost as bad as\u2014if not worse than\u2014not providing the information at all.\nExample: A safety officer discovered that there were stickers posted in areas on a seagoing vessel that said the areas were \u201casbestos-free\u201d even though materials containing asbestos were present. In ruling that the company didn\u2019t exercise due diligence, the Tribunal pointed out that the company couldn\u2019t explain how inaccurate decals had been put up. And it didn\u2019t have a system in place for double-checking or otherwise ensuring the accuracy of such signage [WCAT-2012-00145].\nCompanies are composed of human beings and humans make mistakes. But courts are unlikely to buy that argument that because a safety violation was simply the product of human error, the company should be excused from liability.\nExample: A safety officer inspecting a construction site found that the company hadn\u2019t gotten an underground locate of all utility services before starting excavation work. The company\u2019s excuse for this oversight was that it was \u201cdue to human error.\u201d But the Tribunal rejected this excuse as non-responsive. It pointed out that \u201caccidents are usually due to human error.\u201d The issue here was whether the company took steps to prevent this particular human error from occurring, which it hadn\u2019t [WCAT-2012-00070].\nMost safety violations are the result of flaws in the OHS program of a company that\u2019s genuinely trying to comply but fell short. But if the violations are particularly egregious, say, because they\u2019re the result of wanton disregard for safety or the failure to take simple and inexpensive steps, the company will not only get convicted but likely face an especially high fine.\nExample: A truck driver was killed when a 15-metre-high wall of dirt and rock fell on him. Two companies were convicted of multiple safety violations. That two experienced construction companies could leave a sheer 50-foot wall without any shoring whatsoever was shocking, said the court. It described their conduct as \u201cegregious and outrageous,\u201d noting that the wall could\u2019ve been properly supported for a relatively small amount of money. As a result, the court imposed record fines totally $2,472,500 on the companies [R. v. Perera Development Corp.].\nAs explained in Part 1, there\u2019s no formula for establishing due diligence, no checklist of steps or actions that, if taken, would guarantee a successful due diligence defence. The best you can do is learn from other companies\u2019 experiences in safety prosecutions. The cases in which the due diligence defence failed illustrate what not to do and which omissions will undercut due diligence. The successful cases can provide a sort of blueprint or guide for the steps and actions your company should be taking.\n3. Anyone charged with a violation of the OHS laws, including companies and individuals, can raise a due diligence defence.\n4. The due diligence defence applies to most violations of so-called \u201cregulatory\u201d laws, such as OHS and environmental laws.\n5. Although due diligence isn\u2019t technically a defence to criminal negligence or \u201cC-45\u201d charges, proving that you exercised due diligence makes it impossible to be convicted of criminal negligence.",

    "text": "We can nowadays easily recognise the threat of the profit-first principle of capitalism by reading the newspapers.\nMedia question why TEPCO did not immediately inject seawater into the reactors in order to try to cool them. They blame the delay of the utility\u2019s response for worsening the situation. Some reports say that TEPCO could not make an immediate decision since it knew that once seawater was poured into the reactors they could no longer be used. This illustrates the profit-first principle, the intention to keep using the reactors even after the serious accident occurred.\nAlso in Japan, why are many nuclear reactors located in the same place? Since it costs a lot of money and time to obtain land for a nuclear power plant, they want to build as many reactors as possible once the land is secured. So the answer is simple: to cut costs.\nHowever, earthquakes frequently occur in Japan. It would be disastrous if a major quake hits in an area where nuclear reactors are concentrated. Of course nuclear plant promoters are aware of this, but they continue to build nuclear facilities even in earthquake zones just because they can save money that way.\nMoreover, our nuclear reactors are very old. Out of the 54 reactors in this nation, 20 were built over 30 years ago. There is no set life span internationally recognised for nuclear plants, but of course, the longer they are in operation the more they are weakened by age.\nOne thing we know for sure is that property taxes are levied on nuclear plants for their depreciation period of 16 years. In other words, utilities do not have to pay property taxes after the 16 years of their plants\u2019 operation. That is why they want to continue to use their facilities for as long as they can. Although all six reactors at the Fukushima No.1 plant are old, operating since the 1970s, TEPCO still hesitated to inject seawater into them. This shows how deep seated the profit-first principle is.\nThis profit-first policy is driving the present nuclear power industry. Successive governments have also left the entire question of people\u2019s safety up to industry, thus what we are witnessing now in the Fukushima accident is the worst-ever case of \u201ccapitalism without rules\u201d. We need to think about whether we can afford to keep the situation as it is or not.\nThe LDP is now eagerly challenging the DPJ. It is true that the Kan Cabinet is guilty of unreliable politics, but who is really to blame for the present situation? When I was a Dietmember (MP), I took up the question of nuclear power risks several times in Diet deliberations.\nIn the 2000s, JCP representative Yoshii Hidekatsu pointed out the concrete risks by predicting what disaster could occur at Fukushima\u2019s nuclear reactors in the event of a major earthquake and tsunami. In his Diet questions, he called for certain measures to be taken, stating that the Fukushima plant is highly vulnerable to a disaster.\nHowever, all the cabinets, from LDP\u2019s Koizumi and Abe to DPJ\u2019s Hatoyama, ignored his warning. Although the LDP is the party that had promoted the nuclear energy policy and is to blame for the present catastrophe, it is forgetting its own role and pointing their finger at the DPJ. Of course, the DPJ is irresponsible as a governing party, but the LDP should also be held responsible for the ongoing crisis.\nThe JCP will try its best to make a success of the current major efforts to constrain the nuclear disaster and revive the stricken area by demanding that the DPJ-led government do what we think is necessary and pointing out its neglectful and irresponsible behaviour.\nTogether with reconstruction-related issues, the Japanese people now have to consider other major questions.\nThat is, the Japanese people should squarely address the issues of nuclear energy and what energy policy to choose, and find a reasonable solution with bright prospects for a sustainable future.\nIn this effort the following two points are significant.\n(1) As a strategic approach, we should decide to withdraw from Japan\u2019s present energy policy dependent on nuclear power. Of course it will take a certain period of time to achieve this change. But what we need is to implement the decision now and establish a national strategy for achieving it.\n(2) As an urgent near-term approach, it is essential to establish a structure to control and inspect nuclear facilities with priority on safety by clearly breaking away from \u201ccapitalism without rules\u201d scheme created in the nuclear energy field based on the nuclear \u201csafety myth\u201d.\nIn Japan, we have plenty of nuclear scientists and engineers with no direct relations with electric power companies. We also have the Science Council of Japan, a public organisation of socially-responsible scientists. In addition, some people once involved in nuclear energy projects have recognised the collapse of the \u201csafety myth\u201d and are beginning to raise their voices against the blind promotion of nuclear energy. Utilising the expertise of these people, we should establish the best safety system for nuclear energy in the world to control nuclear facilities with safety truly prioritised while at the same time decommissioning the plants.\nWithout this system, withdrawal from nuclear power will fail to be achieved because abolishing nuclear plants involves a number of stages. After operations come to halt, spent nuclear fuel should be taken out from reactors and disposed of. Since reactors without the spent fuel still give off a significant amount of radiation, this radiation should be removed. Then the reactors have to be dismantled. Measures are also needed to dispose of decommissioned reactors and their nuclear waste. In addition, we should consider how to use the sites after the reactors are removed. These processes will take at least 20 years. And all the stages should be carried out under a strict control system placing priority on safety.\nThese two points \u2013 strategically deciding to break away from nuclear power generation and urgently creating a framework to control and regulate nuclear energy with a mandate and responsibility putting great significance on safety \u2013 should be discussed nationwide. In the national political arena, these two issues will probably become major topics of discussion.",

    "text": "Meet Google's Robot Army. It's Growing.\nGoogle can't stop buying robotics companies. In the past two months, eight of the 12 companies the search giant has acquired have \"robotics\" in their name or descriptions. Here's your complete breakdown of the robot army presently at Google's command.\nAs stated in the midst of its buying spree, the company's largely letting its new robotics divisions continue to work on their preexisting projects, and why wouldn't they? The newly acquired companies are doing a damn good job. They're even winning competitions.\nRobot technology would help with self-driving cars, certainly, but the range of these acquisitions hints at even broader ambitions. Again, we don't know much. They're all a part of the Google X division, which is top secret by definition. We do know what the new companies in the Google family are up to, though, and that might offer us some clues.\nThese guys are rockstars. The Japanese team that got its start at Tokyo University just took the top prize at DARPA's Robotics Challenge Trial thanks to the cunning and agility of its 5-foot, 5-inch, 209-pound bipedal robot. After being purchased by Google in early December 2013, Schaft's blue machine proved to be the best at walking on uneven terrain, climbing ladders, clearing debris, and connecting hoses, ultimately scoring an impressive 27 out of 32 possible points.\nThe company was originally founded to build disaster response robots after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 but has since broadened its scope, thanks in part to funding from the U.S. government. Who knows how far they'll go floating on Google's coffers?\nIndustrial Perceptions, Inc., is an imaging company that spun off of the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage. Before being acquired by Google in December\u2014the day after the Schaft acquisition, in fact\u2014IPI was focusing on building advanced technology for 3D vision-guided robots to be used in manufacturing and logistics. This includes the ability to see and sort different objects, say, in a factory. You could imagine a company like Amazon being very interested in this kind of technology, but it's so far unclear exactly what Google wants to do with it.\nRedwood Robotics started as a joint venture between Meka Robotics, SRI International, and Willow Garage, IPI's parent. And like IPI, it's always had a very focused mission. Redwood wants to build the \"next generation arm\" for robots. Meka Robotics founder Aaron Edsinger once said that he wants to do for robotic arms what the Apple II did for computers. Specifically, Redwood wants to build robotic arms that can work alongside people even in the comfort of their own home. That also means being the common arm manufacturer of service robots, so in the future, everybody's personal robot could have Redwood arms. Well, make that Google arms.\nLike its cousin, Redwood Robotics, Meka is dedicated to building robots that can live and work with human beings. The company describes its flagship model, the M1 Mobile Manipulator, as having \"human-safe, human-soft, and human scale robot technologies that will enable the robots of tomorrow to work alongside people in the home and the workplace.\" The human-like faces on the robot can even emote, a feature that's as creepy as you let it be.\nEven before joining Google, Holomini was a pretty secretive outfit. All we really know from its now shuttered website is the company describes itself as \"Creators of high-tech wheels for omnidirectional motion.\" The image above is just a stock photo guesstimate of what a \"high-tech wheel for omnidirectional motion\" might look like.\nIf Redwood and IPI are the engineers in the family, Bot & Dolly are the artists. The company describes itself as \"a design and engineering studio that specializes in automation, robotics, and filmmaking\" with a mission \"to advance motion control and automation as a creative medium.\" In reality, this means that Bot and & Dolly use robots to help film commercials and movies like Gravity. This doesn't mean that Google wants to get into the movie business, but hey, if a robot's good enough to make a movie, what else can it do?\nBoston Dynamics is the real celebrity of the bunch. After acquiring six robotics companies in six days, Google took a couple of days off before announcing this major acquisition. The company is known for building all kinds of futuristic bots from the bipedal, humanoid robot Atlas (above) to the impossibly fast, four-legged Cheetah. Actually, Boston Dynamics brings a whole robot army to Google, one that the military is very eager to recruit.\nGoogle's latest purchase is less interested in building an actual robot than in designing an intelligent robot brain. The self-described \"cutting edge artificial intelligence company\" that uses \"the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms: comes with a team of 75 researchers and software engineers whose talents could be put to use on anything from the hypothetical Googlebot to the company's flagship search engine and anything in between. Because after all, robots are just another step in Google becoming the company that is everywhere, and does everything.",

    "text": "Thorpe of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association says the decision to raise penalties won\u2019t solve the parking crisis.\nFor more than a decade, Ken Thorpe has been a soldier in the fight against parking tickets, which has become part of the escalating war for access to the curb. It's a conflict that has intensified in recent years as ride-hail services have clogged roads, New Yorkers have had more of their purchases delivered, and the streetscape has been remade with bicycle lanes, pedestrian malls and restrictions on parking and unloading.\nThe city \"has whittled away at the commercial parking infrastructure,\" said Thorpe, the chief executive of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association, which he founded in 2004 to deal with parking issues for small and midsize businesses.\nAt the same time, trucks are making more deliveries than ever, and they must do that regardless of whether there's unloading space available. \"Trucking is not a 'choice' situation,\" Thorpe said. \"It's a necessity.\"\nBut now the 600 members of his group, as well as large fleet operators such as UPS and FedEx, are facing higher fines\u2014and possibly more paperwork and time in traffic court\u2014as a little-known yet controversial city policy comes under fire. The stipulated-fine program was established in 2004 by the Department of Finance to let businesses pay slightly reduced fines\u2014and no fines at all for some infractions\u2014in exchange for not contesting their tickets.\nIt was mainly a way to reduce everyone's administrative costs while having delivery companies pay roughly what they would have otherwise. (The reductions were calculated with an eye on the percentage of tickets that were successfully challenged.) But the program was a sore point with advocacy groups such as Transportation Alternatives, which considered it a corporate giveaway that neutered traffic enforcement.\nLast month, in a bid at leveling the playing field for businesses not in the program\u2014and furthering the city's congestion-reduction goals\u2014the Finance Department announced that next month it would raise the program's fines, including those now set at zero.\nAs if that were not bad enough for Thorpe's membership, in the same week five City Council members introduced a bill to abolish the program. They denounced it as a free pass to large corporations and a contributor to reckless parking and congestion.\nThorpe says it's the council bill that's a giveaway\u2014to parking-ticket brokers, who stand to gain business adjudicating tickets. He sees no way that the Finance Department's plan will change driver behavior or have any impact on congestion.\n\"The theory of the program was there are bad things, good things and some things in between, and it taught the driver you're going to pay a lot to do bad things and little or none to do the others,\" Thorpe said. \"Now they've put the bad and good closer together, removing the driver's incentive for doing the good, because it's going to cost just a little more to do the bad.\"\nIn fact, good and bad parking behavior will not be punished that similarly. The most serious violations that get discounts, such as obstructing traffic ($10 off the $115 total), will now get no break at all, while many of the zero-fine infractions will cost $25.\nBut Thorpe says those increases could cost some of his members hundreds of dollars a week\u2014enough that he would consider taking them out of the program. The $35 fine for double parking outside Midtown is still better than the official $115, but he notes that double parking is legal for the first 30 minutes, and enforcement is not always scrupulous.\nIn 2011 he sued the city, which for some years had been slapping double-parked delivery trucks with the more expensive violation of blocking a travel lane, which carried a $40 fine. In 2016 the city settled and paid those covered by the lawsuit $14 million.\nEven so, the Finance Department, which worked with the Department of Transportation on the new fine schedule, says more needs to be done to ease congestion. The agency says the stipulated-fine program has been sending the wrong signal to the wider parking universe by not reflecting the fact that not all double-parking tickets are dismissed.\n\"We need the program to have incentives that are aligned with the city's goals to reduce congestion, and we need the program to be fair,\" said Finance Deputy Commissioner Jeffrey Shear. \"We agree that the conversation about congestion is a larger conversation, and there are many other factors, and this program is one small piece. But we don't want to send the wrong message by saying double parking outside of Midtown will cost businesses nothing.\"\nThe Transportation Department maintains that it is doing all it can.\nThe agency is \"committed to improving commercial accessibility throughout the five boroughs, especially in the context of our street-improvement projects,\" a spokeswoman said. As part of those projects, \"new curb regulations are installed that are complementary to the larger curb-management goals of the corridor, such as faster bus mobility, reduction of double parking, and better commercial access.\"\nBut the Transportation Department is aware that it's a long way from curing congestion when demand for deliveries from myriad e-commerce businesses, including Amazon and Fresh Direct, is bigger than ever.\n\"Consumer demands and the amount of available space we have at the curb, they're at odds right now,\" Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said at a Crain's breakfast forum last month. She added that parking enforcement can only do so much, and larger fixes, including congestion pricing and technology such as license-plate readers, might be part of the answer.\n\"Right now the demand for the curb exceeds the supply,\" she said.\nSome members of the City Council are not convinced that higher fines will make the program more effective. They say any solution will include abolishing stipulated fines.\n\"This program doesn't work,\" said Costa Constantinides, a City Council member from Queens, who introduced the bill to end the program as one of several parking and transportation proposals. \"Trucks are still parking in bike lanes. It's been around for years, and I really feel it's prohibiting us from having a real conversation around parking that we desperately need to have.\"\nAs part of that conversation, the councilman introduced a bill that would require the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which oversees city agencies, to have buildings under its jurisdiction receive deliveries between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\"The city should lead by example,\" Constantinides said.\nThat's not so simple, it turns out. A Transportation Department off-hours delivery program proved unworkable for many businesses, some of which had to add employees to accept the shipments. The councilman said his program would be \"one part of the puzzle.\"\nAs it happens, parking-ticket broker Glen Bolofsky has contributed more than $4,000 to Constantinides' campaign treasury in the past five years. A spokesman for the councilman dismissed the idea that the bill was intended to help brokers.\n\"The majority of those that benefit from this [stipulated-fine] program are big-box delivery corporations who flout traffic laws at the expense of pedestrians, cyclists and drivers,\" the spokesman said.\nBolofsky agreed that ending the program would help brokers, but he insisted the biggest beneficiary would be the public. \"Congestion will be reduced,\" he said. \"More money will be raised.\"\nAssuming 70% of double-parking tickets are dismissed, he estimated the city has forfeited $147.5 million over the life of the program by not fining participants for double parking beyond Midtown.\nThe new schedule will collect about 30% of double-parking fines, but Bolofsky insists the program still benefits the biggest operators the most. He maintains that neither the city nor companies such as UPS will lose money adjudicating tickets, arguing that many companies still have in-house teams for the job, and automation can reduce the expense further. He noted that the city handled 12 million tickets a year in 1990, when they were handwritten, and had to deal with only 10 million last year. Enforcement agents now use handheld devices that reduce the errors and bad handwriting that led to dismissals.\nThe Finance Department disagrees with his conclusions, saying both the city and the 1,751 companies in the program\u2014encompassing 48,880 vehicles\u2014would spend more without the program.\n\"We would need more hearing officers,\" Shear said. \"The companies would have to retain brokers or hire staff to defend against these parking tickets. In terms of revenue, there would be no increase to the city.\"\nApart from whether the program is good for the city, a walk through Midtown with several UPS executives revealed how difficult following parking rules can be.\nAnother option would be to park at a metered spot a couple of blocks away and cart diamonds by hand truck to recipients, which UPS rules out for security reasons. \"It would put our driver and other people in the area at risk,\" said Axel Carrion, director of state public affairs.\nA few blocks away, on West 50th Street, where commercial parking was allowed at that hour, every space between Sixth and Seventh avenues was taken, mostly by delivery and commercial vehicles. There were two idling for-hire vehicles and three cars with \"parking authorization\" placards\u2014the bane of parking-reform advocates\u2014on their dashboard.\nEven when a UPS driver finds a legal spot, regulations can conflict with the company's efforts to operate efficiently. Using new dispatch-planning technology, the company has increased the number of packages a truck will carry to nearly 400 so that one truck does the work of two. But that truck needs to stay in one place much of the workday, doing pickups when it's done with deliveries. Parking rules\u2014which aim to promote the flow of traffic and keep operators from hogging spots\u2014require it to move after three hours.\nBut circling the block will delay deliveries and the truck could lose the spot, so the driver will stay put. This reduces congestion and pollution. But the ticket, which costs program participants nothing, will set them back $25 under the new schedule.\nOverall UPS expects its payments under the fine program to jump 32% next year, to $21.8 million, with a $3.4 million increase from double parking and more than $1 million from unloading in the wrong spot or at the wrong time. The company says it would like to try other solutions, such as paying for spots where a truck could sit all day. Long term, it would like to see new building construction include space for unloading.\nRight now the firm is weighing the benefits of staying in the program.\n\"My drivers can be trained to avoid the ticket, and we have drastically reduced the amount of tickets over the past couple of years,\" said Dan Byrnes, director of finance at UPS, adding that the city's ticket data aided his efforts. \"Now with these changes, [the city] is not really helping. Just raising prices is not going to change behavior.\"",

    "text": "How to Make Flapjacks - Quick, Easy and Yummy!\nLearn How to Make Flapjacks with this easy recipe. The favourite simple, English, chewy, gooey, kids bake. Add chocolate if you fancy, or use dairy free spread to make them vegan. Use gluten free oats to make them gluten free too.\nI\u2019ve got to tell you, my home baking has fallen down a little lately.\nWe are living in a new house (October, is that still \u2018new\u2019?) which has a pretty rubbish kitchen and once I\u2019ve been cooking all day for work, I kind of forget to cook treats for George and Harriet.\nI\u2019d like to tell you that Mum guilt got the better of me but actually I accidentally ordered a COMEDY sized huge bag of Jumbo Oats by mistake.\nI realised that I\u2019d never shared this recipe and in writing up how to make flapjacks, I\u2019ve realised I MUST make them more. They are SO good!\nBefore we get into the details I feel I should clarify what a flapjack is for any transatlantic readers.\nIn America a flapjack is actually a pancake. English flapjacks are more of a gooey oat/granola bar, made with butter, sugar, golden syrup and oats, all baked in the oven.\nFlapjacks are a super simple and easy treat.\nWhat ingredients do you need to make flapjacks?\nAll you need to make flapjacks are butter, sugar, golden syrup and oats.\nHow do you make flapjacks?\nThe absolute key in how to make flapjacks is all in the cooking time.\nThey really are such a simple bake to make. Firstly you melt unsalted butter in a heavy bottomed pan. Once the butter is melted, stir in sugar and golden syrup. As soon as the sugar is dissolved, you remove the pan from the heat.\nNow stir in your oats, making sure that they are all coated with the mixture.\nPut the flapjack mixture into a baking parchment lined baking tray. Carefully press them down using a spatula to ensure they cook evenly and are the same thickness when you cut them.\nBake in the oven for 20 minutes, the edges of your flapjack should just be starting to brown, but the middle should be soft with a slight amount of wobble.\nWhich oats should I use in flapjacks?\nI used Jumbo whole oats, in this flapjack recipe. They give a lighter, more crumbly texture.\nYou can also rolled oats, which make a more dense flapjack.\nShould flapjacks be crunchy or chewy?\nFor me the perfect flapjack is a chewy one, with slightly crunchy edges. Anything else is simply not good enough!\nHowever, if you of the crunchy flapjack persuasion, just cook your flapjacks for slightly longer.\nWhat other ingredients can I add to my perfect flapjack recipe?\nOnce you have mastered the basic flapjack recipe, the world is your oyster in terms of other flavours.\nA simple covering of melted chocolate after cooking adds some sugary goodness that will be a hit with the children.\nYou can also add dried fruits for an extra portion of fruit.\nThe list is endless, let me know if you find your perfect flapjack flavour!\nDo you cut flapjacks hot or cold?\nLeave the flapjack in the tin until it is completely cooled before cutting into sixteen squares and removing from the tin.\nI think allowing them to cool helps them to keep their shape and means that you don\u2019t need to overcook them.\nCan you make Dairy free or vegan flapjacks?\nYep! Just replace the butter with your favourite dairy free spread.\nHow long do homemade flapjacks last for?\nIn our house this is about 5 minutes but if you can resist temptation this flapjack recipe will last for around 10 days kept in an air tight container.\nYou can also freeze flapjack in portions for up to one month.\nThis perfect sized baking tin.\nGreat quality baking paper like this.\nAlways use a good quality baking parchment to line your baking tray. A top tip is to make small cuts in your parchment at each corner to help it fit the baking tray better.\nYou can vary the type of sugar used in your flapjack. I used soft brown sugar in this recipe to make it chewy and rich. You could also use castor sugar but it won\u2019t be quite as tasty. Dark brown sugar would give a darker appearance and a richer flavour.\nI have used 1tsp of salt in this flapjack recipe. You can leave this out if you are cooking for young children, but I do have to say I think it really adds to the recipe and brings out the flavour.\nIf you prefer you could substitute honey for golden syrup, I haven\u2019t tried this myself, but if you do let me know how you get on.\nIf you fancy some inspiration for other simple sweet treats or after school snacks then take a look at my Ultimate Banana Muffins or Microwave Brownies recipes.\nHope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do. I\u2019d love to know how you got on and what you thought of it if you make this Easy Flapjack recipe. Please rate the recipe and leave me a comment below if you do.\nPS. Look at these two getting in on the post photo act. HAHA! Hope your children enjoy this recipe as much as mine do.\nPreheat your oven to 170deg (fan) 150deg (conventional).\nLine a 20cm x 20 cm baking tray with baking parchment, cut slits in each corner so it fits neatly.\nMelt your butter in a large pan over a low heat.\nOnce melted add your sugar. and golden syrup. Once the sugar has dissolved remove from the heat and stir in the oats.\nGive the entire mixture a really good stir so that all of the oats are coated.\nBake in the oven for 20 minutes, the edges should be starting to brown but the middle should still be soft and wobbly.\nWhen the flapjacks are cold, remove from the tin and slice your flapjack into 16 squares with a sharp knife.",

The Buckeye offense backed him up with 13 hits to improve to a conference best 4-1.\nDeLucia, a junior from Columbus, Ohio (Bishop Watterson) pitched all nine inning and equaled a career high with nine strikeouts against three walks. He allowed just the one run on six hits to improve to 5-1 this season. His five wins lead the Big Ten.\nThe Buckeyes supported DeLucia\u2019s left arm with 13 hits and started the scoring in the first inning. It was the 15th game this season the Buckeyes had scored in the fifth inning. They have outscored their opponents 32-13 in the opening inning.\nOhio State scored twice in the bottom of the first inning to take the early 2-0 lead. Jonathan Zizzo (So., Youngstown, Ohio/Sarasota [Fla.]) led off the inning with a single to center field and went to second on a sacrifice bunt by Matt Angle (So., Whitehall, Ohio/Whitehall-Yearling). Zizzo went to third on fielder\u2019s choice by Eric Fryer (So., Reynoldsburg, Ohio/Reynoldsburg). That put runners at the corners for Ronnie Bourquin (Jr., Canton, Ohio/Canton South), who sent a ball to the right-field corner to plate both base runners.\nFryer launched his third home run of the season against the wind out to left field and gave Ohio State a 3-0 lead.\nIllinois (14-10, 2-3) got that run back in the top of the fifth inning on an RBI single down the left field line by Ryan Snowden. Ryan Hastings led off the inning with a single to left before a foul out and a ground out brought Snowden to the plate with Hastings at second. The Buckeyes (17-6, 4-1) turned a lead-off hit by Bourquin into their fourth run of the game. Jedidiah Stephen (Sr., Caldwell, Ohio/Shenandoah) singled through the left side to put runners at first and second. J.B. Shuck (Fr., Galion, Ohio/Galion) bunted both runners into scoring position before Bourquin scored on a ground out by Adam Schneider (Jr., Agoura Hills, Calif./Agoura) to give Ohio State a 4-1 lead.\nJason Zoeller (Jr., Verona, Pa./Shady Side Academy) finished 3-for-4 in the game, while Bourquin was 2-for-4 and drove in two runs. Angle, Fryer and Stephen had two hits and Fryer and Schneider added RBI. Chase Kliment was 2-for-4 to lead the Illini.\nThe teams will play another game Saturday before concluding the series with a doubleheader Sunday at 1:05 p.m. All three games will be broadcast on AM 920 WMNI.",

    "text": "Not all foods from our childhood are created equal. For every successful product, there was a one-hit wonder that disappeared as soon as we hit puberty.\n3. Tivoli Ice Cream Bar.\n6. Magnolia\u2019s Golden Nangka Fiesta Ice Cream.\n7. Nestl\u00e9 Non-Stop Ice Cream.\n10. Magnolia Chocolait (in bottles).\n14. Coney Island Ice Cream.\nChocobot is best remembered as the brave candy brand who tried\u2013but failed\u2013to dethrone Choc Nut as Philippines\u2019 favorite chocolate.\nKids from the \u201990s would swarm nearby sari-sari stores to have a handful of Chocobot, famous for its Transformers-inspired packaging.\nNot only did we buy it to taste the signature chocolate-peanut candy, but also to (hopefully) win a raffle of some sort. Remember the \u201cBetter Luck Next Time!\u201d printed inside its wrapper? We never figured out what the mystery prize was because Chocobot soon vanished without a trace.\nRoyal Sparkling Soda was born when San Miguel Brewery first ventured into the production of non-alcoholic, carbonated beverages.\nAlso known as carbonated water, a sparkling soda is made by dissolving carbon dioxide in water. The chemical reaction produces a bubbly water which creates an illusion that it \u201csparkles,\u201d hence the name.\nIn the 1940s, Royal Sparkling Soda\u2014advertised as \u201cperfectly carbonated pure mineralized water\u201d\u2014came in green bottles shaped like bowling pins. Over the next decades until the product\u2019s demise, the soda bottle transformed both in terms of design and color\u2014from green to clear and back to green again.\nIn its heyday, Tivoli was known as the \u201cice cream ng masa\u201d because of its affordability. It became the staple of our childhood summer merienda and we didn\u2019t care if it dripped onto our school uniform as long as we enjoyed its creamy goodness.\nManufactured by Consolidated Foods Corporation (which later merged with John Gokongwei\u2019s Universal Robina Corporation), Tivoli ice cream was made from the only ISO-certified ice cream plant in the Philippines.\nThe brand suffered lack of innovation and several disputes with suppliers and dealers. In the end, the cost of the ice cream skyrocketed while its supply dwindled, giving the brand\u2019s international counterparts an opportunity to dominate the local ice cream market.\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the most, if not the most, unpopular soft drinks in the history of local soft drinks, look no further than Yes Cola. However, the thing that made it notorious also made this now-defunct soda brand memorable.\nSo what\u2019s wrong with Yes Cola? As some of the \u201860s and \u201870s kids would recall, each bottle of Yes Cola cost 15 cents. And as they always say, you get what you pay for.\nThe locally-made soda, unlike other more popular brands, had a weird aftertaste. Its variant, the Apple Sidra soft drink, had the same issue: some displeased customers said it tasted like gasoline!\nIn 2006, the popular fast food chain McDonald\u2019s added an East-meets-West product on its menu. They christened it \u201cMcRice Burger\u201d and soon hit the stores in Taiwan and Singapore before being launched in the Philippines.\nMcRice Burger was based on the idea of creating a rice meal that Asians would enjoy anywhere without the use of utensils.\nRice patties, which served as hamburger buns, were made from fragrant white rice. They were toasted to perfection and topped with black and white sesame seeds for that extra aroma.\nMcRice Burger came in two variants: Beef Supreme and Chicken Supreme. Some consumers welcomed the idea; Filipinos, after all, won\u2019t survive a day without eating rice.\nSadly, they were outnumbered by those who thought it was a lame alternative to a regular rice meal, pushing the burger to the ever growing list of discontinued McDonald\u2019s products in the Philippines.\nIf there\u2019s one thing that could explain Magnolia\u2019s staying power, that would be its innovative ice cream flavors. In 1954, for example, the company launched the popular \u201cFlavor of the Month\u201d which, as the name suggests, introduced a different ice cream flavor every month to its Filipino consumers.\nThe ice cream flavors born during this era ranged from the traditional to downright exotic: Chico, Choco Pretzel, Sweet Corn, and Banana Split, among others. Another memorable flavor was the Golden Nangka Fiesta which combined fruit salad and langka (jackfruit) to create a mouth-watering dessert ideal for fiestas and other special occasions.\nMagnolia\u2019s \u201cFlavor of the Month\u201d set the standard for the company\u2019s future product innovations such as the Sorbetes line of the 1980s, which used Philippine fruits and nuts, and the recently launched \u201cBest of the Philippines\u201d line, which pays tribute to different Philippine provinces and their native delicacies.\nOnce upon a time, Magnolia joined forces with Nestl\u00e9 Corporation to manufacture some of the most unique ice cream products Filipinos had ever tasted. Nestl\u00e9 Non-Stop ice cream was one of them.\nMarketed specifically to teenagers, the defunct Nestl\u00e9 Non-Stop was a three-layered ice cream in a cup generously topped with marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and crushed nuts. It also came with a free wooden spoon.\nSome of the most memorable flavors include the Choco Banana Split and the limited-edition Black Desire ice cream (see photo above) which was used to promote the blockbuster movie Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\nBack when one peso was more than enough to buy yourself a merienda or school snack, Fress Gusto was the real deal. A bottle of this root beer soda, which only cost 25 centavos (later increased to 30 centavos), was a perfect companion for your favorite hopia.\nAnd who can forget that Mexican-inspired TV advertisement for Fress Gusto in the 1970\u2019s?\nLittle did we know that the young kid who popularized the tagline \u201cYou\u2019ll like it very mucho!\u201d would later dominate the local music industry as the one and only Gary Valenciano.\nWe don\u2019t consider Storck as a favorite childhood candy, but rather as an \u2018adult\u2019 candy we were once forced to eat. Whether as a remedy for motion sickness during a long trip or as an instant breath freshener, Storck was the menthol candy of choice back in the day.\nStorck outsold all its competitors, so much so that it was being exported to the U.S. by the mid-\u201990s. And then the unthinkable happened: the U.S. Drug Administration discovered in 1996 that the foil-like wrapper of Storck menthol candy had a high amount of lead\u2013toxic enough to cause long-term learning and behavioral problems, among others.\nStorck Products Incorporated (SPI), the company behind the candy, refused to back down.\nWith the help of a toxicologist, they let the public know that there\u2019s no scientific evidence to prove that lead from the wrapper could be absorbed by the candy.\nHowever, the damage had already been done. Rebisco soon took over the struggling company and the Storck we once loved was renamed Starr.\nNothing beats the original. And this is true with Magnolia Chocolait which came in mini glass bottles long before the company decided to put it in tetra packs.\nEverything about the old Chocolait screams \u201cnatural.\u201d It was made from all-natural cow\u2019s milk blended with high-grade chocolate.\nTo enjoy its creamy goodness, you had to put it in the fridge for a while (or longer if you preferred it frozen). The chocolate part would settle at the bottom of the bottle so you had to shake it well before drinking. Hearing that trademark pop when opening the paper lid would signal you to start gulping it down.\nBy the late 1960\u2019s, Chocolait was sold at around 50 centavos. Choco-Vim, a similar yet cheaper chocolate-milk drink, cost 35 centavos.\nBoth were manufactured by Magnolia; Chocolait was sold in square squat bottles while Choco-Vim came in straight-sided ones. The latter eventually phased out, while the former evolved and remains available to this day.\nKids who grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s remember Sunny as the poor man\u2019s fruit juice. One bottle could be diluted with water to produce several glasses of fruit juice. For this reason, it became a staple of parties and other special occasions.\nSchoolchildren would often bring Coleman jug containing this juice as baon. Some public school teachers, on the other hand, made sideline business out of selling this cheap thirst quencher to their students.\nManufactured by Food World Inc., this defunct juice concentrate came in different flavors such as orange, grape, strawberry, and ice cola. An advertising jingle which aired in the noontime show Eat Bulaga! made the product even more memorable.\nBut as much as we wanted Sunny to stay in the market, there was just something too \u2018artificial\u2019 about its taste. This and the rise of higher quality products that overshadowed it ultimately sent Sunny to the graveyard.\nMoonbits was the forgotten Pinoy chocolate candy that once competed with Nips and M&M\u2019s. They were button-shaped candy-coated chocolates manufactured by the defunct Filipino company Serg\u2019s.\nFounded in 1954 by Anton Goquilay, Serg\u2019s Products Inc. was named after Anton\u2019s son, Sergio. Its unique brand of candy bars dominated the market for decades. In the 1980\u2019s, however, the growing discontent with the Marcos administration forced the Goquilays to migrate to the United States.\nWhen Sergio left his teaching job in the US and returned to the Philippines, he brought his father\u2019s company back to life. Serg\u2019s Chocolates once again captured the heart of the Filipino market. However, the success was short-lived.\nWhen the 1997 Asian Crisis hit the Philippines, the beloved chocolate company was not spared. Several debts and labor disputes later, Serg\u2019s filed for bankruptcy.\nJust like Sunny, Julep entered the market when most people preferred juice concentrate over powdered form. It came in different fruity flavors, too: grape, strawberry, orange, lemon-lime, and punch.\nAlthough not much is known about when and how Julep disappeared, we can only surmise that it shared the same fate with Sunny.\nContrary to popular belief, the Coney Island Ice Cream was an all-Filipino brand. But kids who grew up loving its incredible lineup of ice cream flavors didn\u2019t care\u2013they just craved for it.\nWe\u2019ll never forget the bubblegum-flavored ice cream with real bubblegum bits as well as New York! New York!, Pistachio, Mint Chocolate Chip, Choco Pecan Nut, and the iconic ice cream sandwich that started it all\u2013Eskimo Roll.\nThe carnival-themed ice cream brand was introduced to the market in the 1970\u2019s by Seamark Enterprises, a company owned by the Trillana \u2013 De Ocampo families (the same people who gave us Whammos and Go Nuts Donuts).\nSeamark was later bought by Purefoods, but after a brief stint in PBA (there was, in fact, a basketball team named \u201cConey Island Ice Cream Stars\u201d), the brand simply disappeared.",

    "text": "There was a correlation between chiropractic care and subsequent vertebrobasilar artery (VBAI) stroke in persons <45 years, but a similar association was seen in patients receiving general medical practitioner treatment. This may be explained by patients with VBAI dissection-related headache or neck pain seeking care before having their stroke.\nWe will take great care when adjusting your patient. There are a variety of technical procedures for adjusting the neck.\nIf any neck pain patients do not respond to the first few treatments, I will let you know. Case series of chronic whiplash patients have shown they can improve their symptoms with chiropractic care (Injury, 1996). A marked increase in symptoms would contraindicate further treatment with that type of manipulation.\nAsk how I examine patients, and whether I feel x-rays are needed to screen for instability or anomalies. If your patient responds positively to treatment, this would justify continued care, provided there is gradually less weekly frequency. Six to eight adjustments in the first two weeks would not be unusual. This frequency would be rare for a patient in the second month of care.\nPublished articles and books concerning the healing of injured soft tissues (Oakes 1982; Roy and Irving 1983; Kellett1986; Buckwalter/Woo 1988, Majno 2004) indicate that the time frame for such healing is approximately one year.\nNeedless to say the difference between a recovery time of 4-8weeks and 12 months dramatically impacts both clinical practice and expected outcomes.\nHealing Takes Place In Three Specific Phases.\nThis phase will last approximately 72 hours. During this phase, after the initial injury, an electrical current is generated at the wound, called the \"current of injury.\"\nThis \"current of injury\" attracts fibroblasts to the wound (Oschman,2000).\nBecause there is disruption of local vascular supplies, there is insufficient availability of substrate (glucose, oxygen,etc.) to produce large enough quantities of ATP energy to initiate collagen protein synthesis to repair the wound.\nDuring the regeneration phase the disruption in the injured muscles and ligaments is bridged. Some references call the regeneration phase the phase of repair, which creates confusion about the timing of healing (Jackson,1977).\n\"Repair\" connotation is that the process has completed, which, as we well see, is not the case. The fibroblasts manufacture and secrete collagen protein glues that bridge the gap in the torn tissues. This phase will last approximately 6-8 weeks (Jackson, 1977).\nIn 1975, Stonebrink addresses that the last phase of the pathophysiological response to trauma is tissue fibrosis. Boyd in 1953,Cyriax in 1983, and Majno/Joris in 2004 note that there is tissue fibrosis subsequent to trauma.\nIn addition, Cyriax notes \"fibrous tissue is capable of maintaining an inflammatory response long after the initial cause has ceased to operate.\"\nSince inflammation alters the thresholds of the nociceptiveafferent system, physical examinations in these cases will show these fibrotic areas display increased sensitivity, and digital pressure may show hypertonicity and spasm.\nOne of the conclusions of this study is that the patient's symptoms would not improve after a period of two years following the injury.\nIt is established neurologically (Wyke 1985, Kirkalady-Willisand Cassidy 1985) that when a chiropractor adjusts(specific directional spinal manipulation) the joints of the region of pain and/or spasm, that there is a depolarization of the mechanoreceptors that are located in the facet joint capsular ligaments, and that the cycle of pain and/or spasm can be neurologically aborted. This is why many patients feel better after they receive specific joint manipulation from a chiropractor following an episode of increased pain and/or spasm.\nSo Many Patients Suffer From?\nA good explanation is found from Gunn (1978, 1980, 1989). He refers to this type of pain as super sensitivity.\nThe super sensitivity type pain is a residual of the scarring or the fibrosis that was created by the injuries sustained in this accident.\nGunn, C. Chan, Pain, Acupuncture & Related Subjects, C. Chan Gunn, (1985).\nKellett, John, \"Acute soft tissue injuries-a review of the literature,\" Medicine and Science of Sports and Exercise, American College of Sports Medicine, Vol. 18 No.5, (1986), pp 489-500.\nKirkaldy-Willis, W.H., M.D., & Cassidy, J.D.,\"Spinal Manipulation in the Treatment of Low-Back Pain,\" Can Fam Physician, (1985), 31:535-40.\nStonebrink, R.D., D.C., \"Physiotherapy Guidelines for the Chiropractic Profession,\" ACA Journal of Chiropractic, (June1975), Vol. IX, p.65-75.",

    "text": "Home / Blog / Bitqyck Review \u2013 Is This A Good Opportunity Or Big Scam?\nBitqyck Review \u2013 Is This A Good Opportunity Or Big Scam?\nIn the last few weeks, Bitqyck has been getting a lot of attention in the network marketing circles.\nWith all this hype, I am sure you have seen some of your friends trying to sell Bitqyck in your social media feeds.\nThe first thing you need to know is that I am NOT an affiliate or distributor for Bitqyck.\nI wanted to gather all the information about Bitqyck in my Bitqyck Review in order for you to make a decision about joining Bitqyck.\nIs Bitqyck legit or a scam?\nLet me show you in my unbiased review of Bitqyck.\nWhat The Heck Is Bitqyck?\nIn today\u2019s latest review, we\u2019re taking a look at an MLM opportunity by the name of Bitqyck. As the \u201cBit\u201d part of the company\u2019s name might suggest, Bitqyck is the latest company to take a stab at the MLM niche of cryptocurrency.\nFor those that haven\u2019t been following the MLM landscape that closely over the past year or so, the field of cryptocurrency has gotten insanely popular over the past year or so as a new means of making money and offering a new business opportunity.\nLooking at Bitqyck, we\u2019ve got a company that\u2019s based out of Texas in the United States and has a co-founder by the name of Sam Mendez.\nSam Mendez is a name that might be familiar to some of you, and that\u2019s because Bitqyck isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen Mendez get involved with the world of MLM.\nThe first reported company that Sam Mendez was affiliated with was My Shopping Genie, with Mendez showing up once again as the co-founder for this company as well.\nUnfortunately for Sam, My Shopping Genie wasn\u2019t around for too long as it eventually collapsed after a period of six months or of being unable to pay its affiliates.\nFollowing My Shopping Genie\u2019s collapse in mid-2012, Mendez went on to launch 15 Winks in 2014 \u2014 a opportunity that offered a dating app after buying in to a subscription plan.\nCalorchi succeeded 15 Winks in 2016 as an e-commerce platform with a cryptocurrency element, but current Alexa rankings for the Calorchi website indicate that the company shut down around the second half of that same year (2016).\nWhat Are The Bitqyck Products?\nIn regards to the product line that Bitqyck has to offer, the company does\u2019t have any true goods or services that are being sold to retail customers. Instead, Bitqyck sells nothing more than access to its affiliate membership program.\nIf and when someone decides that they\u2019d like to become an affiliate for the company, they will be given the opportunity to invest real dollars into Bitqy. Bitqy is the in-house cryptocurrency that Bitqyck has created, and affiliates are also able to generate sales through an e-commerce platform.\nI tried to look into said platform to see just what it has to offer, but there\u2019s currently not a lot of detailed information about it not he Bitqyck website.\nWhat About The Compensation Plan For Bitqyck?\nMembers of Bitqyck are able to earn money by recruiting other individuals to invest their own dollars into the Bitqy currency and by generating sales through the company\u2019s e-commerce system.\nWhen it comes to investing money into Bitqy, there are three main levels of investment that affiliates have access to. Bitqyck calls these \u201cproduct options\u201d, and the first one sees members investing $199 in order to get $200 worth of Bitqy coins.\nThe product option above this asks affiliates to invest $349 to receive $400 worth of Bitqy, and the last level requires an investment of $499 in order to get a whopping $600 worth of Bitqy.\nCommissions that affiliates have access to are paid out in two main ways, and the first has to do with investing money into the Bitqy coins.\nWhenever a personally recruited affiliate of yours invests their own money into the Bitqy coins, you\u2019re able to earn a 10% commission based off of how much money they decided to invest.\nIn addition to this, you\u2019ve also got access to a matching bonus of 10% for any affiliates that your downline is able to recruit and get to invest as well.\nThe second main commission that affiliates are able to earn come through the e-commerce platform.\nThese commissions are handled in a very unique manner, with a 25% commission being offered to an affiliate who introduces a customer to the platform that then decides to purchase product from it. A 25% commission is also paid out to the affiliate that was behind the recruitment of the referring affiliate in this situation, and that same 25% commission is even offered to the e-commerce merchant and the customer that\u2019s buying from the platform.\nWhat\u2019s The Cost Of Joining Bitqyck?\nIf you\u2019d like to join Bitqyck for whatever reason, the membership is free to start out with.\nWith this being said, you\u2019ll need to either recruit someone who invests at least $199 or make the investment yourself if you\u2019d like to be considered an official affiliate for the company.\nSo, Is There A Bitqyck Scam Going On?\nHave you been hearing rumours that Bitqyck is a scam?\nSo \u2013 what is the truth? Is there really a Bitqyck scam going on?\nIf I am being perfectly honest, Bitqyck isn\u2019t entirely a scam.\nFinally, My Bitqyck Review And Conclusion!\nFrom what I can tell, Bitqyck is simply a relaunch of what Mendez tried before with Calorchi.\nLooking at the company and its e-commerce platform from the perspective of a retail customer, I don\u2019t see anything at all that\u2019s very compelling.\nCustomers don\u2019t care about earning money, they want to save money. Furthermore, if a customer decides they want to buy something form the Bitqyck platform, they\u2019ll need to invest money into Bitqy.\nAt the time of this writing, Bitqy is not tradable on the public market in any fashion. This likely isn\u2019t ever going to change, and with Bitqy not being a public cryptocurrency, Mendez can pretty much set the value of it at whatever he would like.\nThe requirement of having to purchase Bitqy in order to buy items from the e-commerce platform will quickly turn off any real retail clients, leaving the only interested individuals being affiliates who are looking to make a quick buck.\nAffiliates for Bitqyck will more than likely spend the majority of their time focused on investing in Bitqy and recruiting others to do the same, and just like similar opportunities that have come before Bitqyck, the whole operation will start to fall once this recruitment activity dies down.\nI really hope you have gained value from my Bitqyck Review.\nI wanted to make sure you had all the information you needed, because most other Bitqyck reviews are just trying to sell you something.\nIf you really do decide to join Bitqyck, I want you to succeed with your business. Learn how to market yourself properly!",

So far, easy maintenance. Very pleased with our choice in spa.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Nick from We like our spa Very nice. Moderately priced. Easy to keep clean.Shopped many different brands before choosing Caldera and glad we did.\nRated 4 out of 5 by so Cal soaker from enjoying the bubbles... While I find the vanto very comfortable, the built in bromide and mineral system was challenging to monitor. Thought it would be a no fuss system... But after 5 months of constant checking and altering... I'm back to floating bromide tablets. Unit holds temperature well and is very comfortable. We use the spa frequently.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Tiki from We spend alot more time in the yard! We have a small corner yard. It was hard to entertain in, once we bought the spa that all changed. We have two children they love to have their friends over. Especially when the weather is cooler. At times there has been more than 10 kids in it. The boys have gotten very creative at making games for the spa. Together we have spent hours of family time in it. I often host a moms night w my girlfriends and whine which is always a hit.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Eaglerivertub from Vanto We've had the Vanto for almost a year. It has held up well to our moderate to low usage and all the knobs, controls and head rests have held up to four kids 5-11 years old. Water care was easy once we gave up on the bromine and went with regular chlorine granules. Overall a good quality purchase that we enjoy using.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Happyhusband from Deep Seats The one bonus for my husband is the extra deep seat. He is a big guy, so being able to actually be covered with water while he is enjoying it is great.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Mom22 from Water Issues My husband loves the new spa, but he does not need to maintain it! The Spa Frog does not provide adequate bromine even at the highest level. We were told, after the fact, that this is an issue with the larger spas. That means we need to add bromine tablets as well. Further more, the \"Ozinator\" only runs when the pump is running. This impacts energy efficiency because we need to run the pump 12 hours a day. Having its own power supply would have been a big plus.\nRated 3 out of 5 by hot tub chuck from Hot Tub The hot tub water is very cloudy and no seems to give a good explanation why.\nRated 3 out of 5 by 3boys from Disappointed Replaced an old hot tub with a Caldera and have spent the first year trying to keep the tub clean. For some reason the cleaning system does not keep water and hot tub clean. The place of purchase just keep selling me more chemicals. Hot tub looks good. We wish it worked better..very disappointed..\nRated 3 out of 5 by scorjo44 from Happy My 1st. hot tub. Happy with it so far. Use it alot more in winter than summer.\nRated 3 out of 5 by JayM from Help Ok, got this spa delivered a few weeks ago so I could not hook it up right away due to the cold weather spell here in NY. I finally got a decent weekend and got to work. All new 8/3 wiring, 50amp breaker in the main panel, new sub panel w/a 50amp breaker, outside line in flex conduit. got all the wiring done and wanted to test to ensure connectivity before filling, I figured a brief light up on the spa panel...shut it off...fill it up and good to go. Not so much. Everytime I hit the breaker in the sub panel it trips. I went over EVERYTHING 3 times to make sure it was all done properly and it still does the same thing. Any help would be appreciated. Is there a dummy sensor in this...to save people from themselves? I'm at a loss at this point. Im a general contractor and have reasonable electrical experience along with this being one of many I have done.....but this is getting the best of me.\nRated 3 out of 5 by Brocko from Good at times I like my spa. However I have had trouble with it as far as the jets go and leaks. The service people have came out 3 -4 times and apparently cant fix it because they were ordering a part and it wasnt replaced.\nRated 2 out of 5 by Vanto from Rough start but we love our hot tub We sat in every hot tub in town and ended up selecting the Vanto based on the styling, comfort, and price. We had many problems with the unit over the first 3-4 months that we owned it from vacuum pressure sensors to the main control board had to be replaced. The service from the company we purchased the tub was not as knowledgeable as I expected. When the unit would simply not heat they came out and said the filter was dirty. We had only owned it for a few weeks and the filter was absolutely clean. Once a new vacuum sensor and control board were replaced we then had problems with the ionizer that we purchased as an adder. This is not a Caldera problem but yet another problem by the dealer as they installed the wrong size port. We have also had both heating element couplers break in a span of a few weeks. When this happens it spits water all over the inside of the cabinet, a huge problem in the winter months as this cabinet is un-insulated. The entire tub has to be drained to replace the couplers which means there is a real danger for the cabinet to ice up until the heater can turn back on. I remain nervous that this may happen again as the dealer could not offer any explanation as to why this happened twice in less than a month. Since all of these initial problems however we have had a trouble free experience with the unit and I'm in it nearly every day. I switched from the included Spa Frog bromine system to regular chlorine as it is easier to keep the water clean with less hassle and a smaller amount of chemistry. The only negative I would say is that our power bill went up $60 or so per month and we expected only $30. With the main cabinet being un-insulated it is no wonder that during the winter the heater runs frequently. I plan to add some insulation to the main cabinet to hopefully offset our high power bill. Everything else about the unit is great. It's comfortable, has enough jets and features to make a great soaking experience and we absolutely love it. Had we been able to avoid the initial problems I would rate it five stars for everything but energy efficiency.\nRated 2 out of 5 by bandit780 from 2014 tub We have only had our tub 1 1/2 years. The first month of ownership (Dec 2014) we had to drain the tub. All four foot jet chrome ring covers fell off. So we drained the tub, re glued them and refilled our tub. They have stayed on now. Spring 2015, noticed a panel on the outside of the tub where the lid lifter is attached is cracked. We believe that because of the unstability of the cheap lid lifter, it jerks on the lid on the opposite side that you are using to lift the hot tub lid.Contacted company we bought from at the end of March 2015. End of May we got a call that they will replace the panel(because its under warranty) but we will have to pay mileage for them to come and repair it. We live 75 miles one way from the dealer. Wow, really? Not happy with this situation and don't feel we should pay for parts that are under warranty and obviously defective. Dealer told us they had 4 of them with similar problem.\nRated 1 out of 5 by johndoe44 from Won't buy again unless Caldera provides access to parts I purchased my spa with the waterfall feature. This no longer works due to a cheap plastic part cracking. It also affects usage of the spa itself as water spews out the opening where the waterfall control should be. I can't purchase the part from the dealer and see no access to parts online at Caldera. It's easy enough to take the apparatus out and replace the part if I could get the part. To replace the part I have to purchase the entire $35 apparatus to get one little cheap plastic part which probably costs less than $1 to make. It just shows a lack of consideration for the customer to even produce the product with such a cheap plastic single point of failure and then on top of that to not provide a way to replace the part.\nRated 1 out of 5 by ProblemsinAlaska from Problems The first time using this 8 jet covers came off. To date 29 jet covers have been replaced. Within a month a large crack developed. I haven't even had it a year... nothing but problems.\nRated 1 out of 5 by ffmom from Awful Don't share with you that the ozone generator does NOT work continuously - only when the pump is running - NOT very energy efficient. Gave it away! Also the backflow valve for the ozone failed after 11 months. Service tech said this is normal!!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Joe from Vanto I am very pleased with my spa. I didn't think it was a good investment at first but I loss that discussion with my wife and today I am glad she won!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Vantovacationer from Should have made this purchase sooner My husband and I love the Vanto! It is large enough to fit 4-7adults comfortably and leaves enough room to access jet areas for a completely relaxing experience. The controls for jet speed and temperature are easy to use and reach from the cool down seat. The lighting and waterfall options are a nice feature but not necessary to enjoy this spa.\nRated 5 out of 5 by BunkyFourBeers from Worth every penny... Best purchase of my life. I wish I just would have pulled the trigger and bought a quality hot tub like this ten years ago, but I thought it was too much of a hassle to maintain. Man, was I wrong. Its so ridiculously easy. And to think of the good times I let slip by by not buying this earlier... Oh well, it mine now!\nRated 5 out of 5 by aamcz from Great spa Love this spa. The lighting features are great. It is easy to maintain/clean. And can use it with water temperature hot or cold.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Chuck from Vanto I could not be happier with my Spa. It works exactly as promised. We use it daily, it's easy to maintain, and inexpensive to operate. The Spa Frog mineral system is great. It took me a little time getting the water balanced but the directions are spot on. I'm using factory setting & recommendations and it works great. Thank you Caldera for building a great product.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Asiaf from Caldera Vanto We've owned our spa for a little over a year now and are still completely in love with it. It fits our lifestyle perfectly and is regularly enjoyed by our family and lots of friends. Would definitely recommend this spa to others!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Force22 from Vanto The vanto spa we purchased is great! Excellent product and great customer service experience.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Jim from YOU WILL LOVE THIS SPA! I shopped for spas for over a year before I made the decision to go with the Caldera Vanto. The reason I took my time was because years ago I purchased a lesser spa from another manufacturer and was disappointed with it. I did not want to make that error again. I am happy to report that the Vanto was worth the wait. The jets are very strong, the fit and finish are stunning and the quality is world class. The controls are logical and simple to use and the lighting is beautiful and tasteful. Water maintenance is a breeze and all is well on my little patio. If you happen to live in the Tampa Bay area, you should stop in and see Jerry at Tampa Bay Spas. He is a true professional and has a passion for hot tubs that shows in his enthusiasm for Caldera. This guy actually took the time to hand write instructions for my tub sanitizing schedule. I could not be more impressed.\nRated 5 out of 5 by themaroon from Incredible spa for the money We wet tested a few brands and just loved this spa so much I had to get one. It doesn't have the most raw horsepower, but it's unbeatable for its price range, and two seats do have some pretty good power. All of the seats are comfortable. There isn't a huge mix of hydrotherapy options. Every seat just works a slightly different part of your back. I'd love some more leg/side options. But at this price range it's hard to complain. I'm not a big fan of the Spa Frog. The minerals are expensive and not helpful for sanitation (and maybe harmful to the tub). Bromine tablets in a floater are much cheaper and equivalently good. I'm going to try rigging a floater to fit in the inline Spa Frog chamber since it's nice to have it out of sight.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Cabin Boy from Turned our summer lake cabin into a year around retreat For our 25th wedding anniversary gift to each other we built a patio on the lake side of our weekend cabin. After years of thinking about hot tubs we took the plunge and made the Caldera Vanto our patio's signature feature. Wow! I'm not the kind of person who typically enjoys sitting still. That changed with the Vanto. We spent hours and hours in the tub relaxing, listening to football games on the radio, gazing at the stars and watching the activity on the lake. We now find ourselves going to the cabin much more in the fall and winter so we can spend time in the hot tub. Even New Year's Eve included a sub-zero hot tub excursion. The Vanto has a great range of water pump speeds, fun accent lights and an easy to use cover. It has become a wonderful gathering point for our family.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Jo from Best bang for your buck!! Powerful, comfortable seats 5 very easily. Waterfall feature is much appreciated by young children, they love it. With this tub you never need to upgrade because it has everything and very easy to use no complicated buttons or complex programming. It's great in the winter too and the electricity bills are very low. Love it!!!\nRated 5 out of 5 by JVK3700 from We have enjoyed more family time together in our spa. The Vanto spa has been a good purchase for our home. It's attractive on our deck and quiet when running. It doesn't require a lot of maintenance or time to maintain.\nRated 5 out of 5 by j12 from Great Spa This is the second spa we have owned and the ease of the chemical frogs is wonderful. Our water never stayed as nice with prior tub.\nRated 5 out of 5 by JLW from Good value We have no complaints at all. Love our tub and use it most days.\nRated 5 out of 5 by aamcz2516 from Glad we chose caldera We purchased the vanto and we love all the features and ease of maintenance. We use it once to twice a week and we were expecting a higher electric and water bill but we didn't notice much change. The only minor issue we have is when we close the spa cover, the head rests at the far side of the pool (the side the cover sits while open) pop off from the cover rubbing against those head rests. It appears they do this because is looks like the top of the head rests are raised slightly above the pool rim.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Susan from Best money we ever invested for family time I did all the research to find the best spa for our money. This landed, hands down, with a decision to buy the Vanto Caldera Spa. We were looking for a quality spa with maximum seating, so this version without the lounger was perfect. The main reason we wanted a spa may have been different that others - we simply wanted a place we could hang out with our tween and teen kids without phones, tvs, or facebook! I can't tell you how many wonderful conversations that we have had with one or all of our kids that would probably never have happened inside with all the distractions. My husband and I have said countless times, after a significant conversation with a kid in the spa, that it was the best money we could have ever spent as parents. It also makes our house a more inviting hang out spot for their friends, since they all love to get in the spa as well. The best part is that it is always ready... no warm up time... so it is something that we or their friends can always do spontaneously!\nRated 5 out of 5 by MzrJoe from The best idea we ever had! We shopped for about four months before Lonny, of Crystal Pools in Elizabethtown, Pa., suggested the brand new Vanto model from Caldera. Despite not having a floor model to examine, we were familiar its first cousin, the Marino. This model had been number 1 on our shopping list. The only thing we didn't want with the Marino was the lounger as we did not want to give up a guest-seat. The Vanto addressed this concern. The good news is that because the Vanto is a 7-footer, my family can slouch in their seats and be as comfortable as if we had lounges. This is because there is something to press your feet against from virtually every position in the tub. Speaking of seats, each one has a unique array of jets. When my wife and I use it, we rotate between the seats, which allows for a varying set of enjoyable stimuli over different muscle groups. Not only do the accompanying foot jets provide amazing pleasure (i have a neuroma in my right foot), the bubble-shaped well helps users stay better-positioned in their seats. The lighting array is beautiful at night and the buttons which control the jets, heat, and lights are all very easy to use. The Vanto is built with very sturdy construction. If i were to suggest anything, it would be to add more color choices for the housing. One of my great concerns about owning a spa was a fear of chemical smell. But the Frog Spa system greatly reduces the amount of chlorine needed compared to friends who own pre-Frog models. After use, we feed the tub about 1 tsp of chlorine crystals and that does the trick. We keep the bromine on a 3 setting. These are pretty low doses of cleaning chemicals. Not does this GREATLY reduce the smells that I have hated over the years, but the fewer the chemical used, the less we are spending on them. We use the tub for about an hour to ninety minutes at a time and so far, our skin has handled all of this very well. The Vanto sits in a great price point and if you are in the E-town area, the folks at Crystal Pools are great to work with!\nRated 4 out of 5 by JR_AZ from Happy owner Well constructed, love the pressure and location of the jets. especially like the fact that different seats focus jets in different locations. the cartridge chlorine is a nice touch, although I still find I have to add chlorine manually which I thought was avoided with the cartridge. overall, highly recommend the spa to anyone!\nRated 4 out of 5 by My2dice from Vanto is good We like our Vanto a lot! We use it all the time!!!\nRated 4 out of 5 by R&S from Caldera Spa Owner We like our spa and the set up and delivery were great. I see the difference however in the jets. The action of them is less than what I expected. The foot massage at the center is also a bit in the way for most users. Overall good spa and quality seems to be good.\nRated 4 out of 5 by MM from We love our new spa We absolutely love our new spa. We especially love the foot sprays, which I've never seen on a spa before. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I wish there were an option to have all of the jets on low. Unfortunately, the only low option only turns on two of the jets, while the other two options have some or all of the jets on high. The jets are actually somewhat painful for me on high and not relaxing, but I love them on low. No biggie, since I can usually snag one of the two jets turned on when we have it on the low setting, but that would be a change I'd like to see perhaps.\nRated 4 out of 5 by RC from Vanto review Very happy with Vanto hot tub. Easy and simple to use and maintain. Local dealer very professional with install and providing me with maintenance tips and suggestions. Glad I went with Caldera Spas.\nRated 4 out of 5 by TheGolfer from Great hot tub Our old hot tub finally died. We purchased the Vanto hot tub and are happy with our purchase. The largest driver of the purchase was the value to tub provided. We rent our place 130 days/year and use it another 30 ourselves. Thus, we wanted a tub that was pretty basic, but appeared / was comfortable. We also didn't want to pay the exorbitant prices some of these manufacturers suggest. The Vanto met all those goals.\nRated 4 out of 5 by ronnAK from The Hut Tub is very good. I am very happy with the Hot Tub and the features are just what I need. My only reservation is the Frog system. It seems to go through the bromine cartridges very fast. After one week I get a low Br reading and there is still Br in the cartridge. I shake it and get another week out of it. I am seriously considering trying a Br tablet floating dispenser rather than the Frog..\nRated 4 out of 5 by Krsweet from Good quality for the price Only improvement I would like is the ability to upgrade filters.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Jewel45 from Overall Happy Purchased the Vanto Series hot tub. Very happy with purchase and price. We use it almost every day in the fall, winter and spring! We emptied it for summer too hot here for use.\nRated 4 out of 5 by Mark from What is with those lights? The tub seems like the best one we've had in all regards except the lights. We either sit in the dark or put up with disco ambiance. Worst part? There are lights that sit above water level which are irritatingly in your eyes the whole time unless you just dispense with the lights altogether. Who thought that was a good idea?\nRated 4 out of 5 by NeedABetterMouse Trap from Have a mouse in the cabinet not sure how it got in - but the insulation from inside started to pile up on the outside... checked with our dealer and they said likely a mouse - plug any openings with steel wool and that should take of it - we will try it, but i don't understand how or where the would be a hole large enough for a mouse to get in or out?\nRated 5 out of 5 by HE from Very pleased We are very pleased with our Caldera Vanto Spa. It has all the features that we could want, the sitting set up is what we desired, and we are very impressed with the quality of the unit.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Aunt Sparky from Well Worth the Money We purchased our Caldera Hot Tub around the first of the year. My doctor approved it for knee surgery that I had, and actually wrote a letter approving it for my knee. We were able to alleviate the taxes on it. We have used it for 7 months now and absolutely love it! Very easy to use! We cleaned it for the first time a week ago, and it could not have been easier! The draining, cleaning, refilling did take most of the day, but it turned out to be so easy! We definitely recommend the Caldera Spas.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Bugs from A hot tub that is really Hot! We have owned this tub for one and a half yrs! Great value on a. Very good tub. Easy to maintain.quiet and great lights!

No problems at all.\nRated 5 out of 5 by WLMC from Great tub, but outstanding customer service We love our tub, but when we had a problem with our pump, what was even more amazing was the customer service that we received. They Watkins/Caldera group went above and beyond to help us with the problem. They are an outstanding company, I would highly recommend their products and their people!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Hap from Great Product We would not have made our purchase if it had not been for Cassidy Anderson's help out of the Clackamas OR store. Her knowledge of her product and the competition made all of the difference. She also offered us a deal that when compared to the other two brands we were considering was too good to turn down. We had an old Bullfrog tub and the massaging and comfort difference with the Caldera tub is like night and day. We would definitely recommend Caldera to someone considering a new hot tub.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Bugs from HOT TUB FUN Nice Tub.It was nice experience from the sale to install and use.I had an old tub that was replaced and this is soo good.Room inside the shell is great.It is the same size as my old one,but sooo much better,Lites and waterfall are a fun fit and care has been pretty easy with the canister system we use.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Rick from Our First Spa It is our first spa and it has been an outstanding purchase. I use it more than my wife because of a bad back, but we both have just loved it on cool or cold nights. The setting and the beautiful colored lights sets the mood. Living in south Alabama it gets quite hot during the summer months but that does not stop my getting in for all the jets and warming of my bad back after a day of golf or working in the yard. It is very beautiful and easy to maintain after just a little home reading and working at it. We love our Spa!\nRated 5 out of 5 by MangoMango from Good spa for the money, We shopped many different brands. The Vanto is a good value.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Lonn111 from Such a GREAT PICK!!!!!

A night in my hot tub before bed and sometimes I the morning before work. I am sleeping better and my back is feeling better.\nRated 5 out of 5 by mac_quad from Great tub...only a couple of issues We had our spa installed last year and thoroughly have enjoyed it, especially during the winter. I did not notice any increase in my energy bill this winter, and we had the spa constantly on at 103 degrees. The only major issue we have had was that the lighting system malfunctioned. Fortunately, it was covered by the warranty and the spa dealer spent a lot of extra time to ensure everything was operating properly. The lights have worked great ever since. One feature disappointment was that the waterfall is not lighted. It has the same light bar under the waterfall jets as other Caldera spas, so I assumed it was lighted like the other spas. I should have checked that out...oh, well I should know not to assume anything! Lastly, the chrome circular donuts on each of the smaller jets keep coming off. They are easily re-installed, but why are they not more securely attached? Overall, we are pleased with the spa and despite the issues listed above, we would purchase the Vanto again.\nRated 5 out of 5 by pianocrazed from Great Price and Great Product We didn't want to spend a fortune but we also didn't want a tacky cheap product. This hot tub was the perfect balance of cost and quality. It looks expensive, has all the right jets (particularly love the foot jets, and the adjustable back jets), has a few nice touches (like the lights and waterfall feature) without being extravagant. The water maintenance has been a breeze. We've got a pretty simple scheduled routine that keeps things nice and tidy, so the tub is always ready when we feel like hopping in for a soak. We highly recommend this hot tub!\nRated 5 out of 5 by SiemersSpa from Time with Un-Plugged Teens Our Vanto hot tub was a 20th anniversary splurge for my husband and me. We have never owned a hot tub, but were intrigued by the idea of unwinding outside together each evening - and decided this gift would be a longer-lasting alternative to a trip to Mexico, which we had considered as a gift to one another. We've been very pleased with everything about the Caldera model we chose. The unexpected part of our purchase was how it has enhanced time with our two teenage daughters. It has been fun to see how they look to that quiet time to pop in and connect with us - or even how they pull up a stool outside of the hot tub and catch us up on their evening as we sit in the tub and relax with a drink. The kids have enjoyed the tub on their own, as well. One night, we allowed them to host a \"dive-in movie\" with a small handful of friends - projecting a movie on the side of the house near the hot tub. They were pretty wrinkled by the end, but enjoyed the chilly night from their warm spot in the tub. One accessory we added, which we would highly recommend is the Bluetooth sound system. We didn't originally order it, but after turning up external speakers to try to hear them within the tub, we quickly understood the value of the built-in speakers, which project sound right at \"ear level\" inside the tub. This is a better way to keep the sound down, as we wanted to be sensitive to the neighbors. My husband is pleased with the sub-woofer which enhances the sound, considering the relatively small speakers. All-in-all, we're very happy with our purchase, and hope (expect) to continue using it as regularly as we do now!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Gordon from Terrific Hot Tub!! I've had a couple of hot tubs but this one is the easiest to manage and keep in good shape. I love the filter location and the way the filter rises and falls with the water level. I have 9 grand kids and they lOVE the spa. When they get out of the tub I simply add a small amount of chlorine and the tub stays clean. What a dream this tub is.\nRated 5 out of 5 by TimG from Ghormley Hot Tub Review We love our hot tub.

I love my spa, but due to my ignorance I have trouble keeping out the suds. I clean my filter and use the sanitizer and clearifier as directed, but the suds seem to grow over night.

Maybe a spa water treatment class is needed.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Rackmanjru from Rest & Relaxtion Best purchase I ever made. We use our spa almost each and every day.

Don't wait buy one today!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Tim from Vanto....Excellent value We love our Caldera Vanto spa. Enough room for my teenage daughters to have friends over. It has been extremely easy to maintain with Spa Frog. I added the blue tooth wireless sound system and it made our experience even more enjoyable.

For our anniversary gift to one another we decided to purchase a spa. We have talked about this for a long time. I always thought they were a waste of money, I was wrong! We absolutely love our Vanto and the fact that it is a non lounger was a selling point for us. It is very comfortable and we have three daughters that love it too. We believe we have the perfect set up for it with our deck and patio entertainment area. Nothing like watching some college football from the comfort of your spa!!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mike from So happy with my choice of spa We shopped around from used to various brands of new and are so glad we settled on the Caldera Vanto. We purchased the pearl white one in the espresso cabinet a month ago. It looks beautiful and is very comfortable. Kids love it as well. Have no regrets on our decision.

Every night we spend time together relaxing in the spa and enjoying each others company. It was well worth the money so far and, the system works perfectly. We haven't received a new electric bill yet to see how efficient it is. Overall, my family and I love it!!!\nRated 5 out of 5 by DJW1200 from Love it Glad we bought it. Has a lot of room. We shopped at 3 different spa company's and seven seas treated us like we meant something to them. From buying the spa to install seven seas was awesome. We love our spa. Great place to sit and talk with he kids!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Rmoon604 from Vanto We have had our new hot tub for about 1 month now and we love it.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Jimmy from 3 RELAXING YEARS I hope readers know that all hot tubs are not the same. I have owned other brands and found out the hard way. I can tell you my Caldera Vanto is quiet and powerful. It needs almost no maintenance looks as new as the day I bought it. I have spent many hours with my family relaxing and strongly recommend Caldera to anyone I speak to about hot tubs.\nRated 5 out of 5 by South Jersey from Wish we purchased it years ago! We have only had the spa for 1 month but we love it!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Terry from Great hot tub first time My wife and I have done alot of shopping around. We have been very happy with this pick of the hot tubs that are out in the market. Myself, I have been very especially happy during the colder weather. I use the hot tub on a weekly basis. I am very happy with the vanto hot tub. I do not regret making this purchase. Well worth the value, effort and time that was invested to make the right choice. Thanks caldera for a great value... cannot express enough how much I enjoy my hot tub. P.S. with the aurround system.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Boomer from Tub is wonderful! Our tub is wonderful! this was the best gift my wife and i ever gave ourselves!\nRated 5 out of 5 by James from Month old We did our research and have loved our spa. Took only about a week for us to grasp and understand how to care for the water. We have used it as a family almost every night. Great conversations are happening between my wife and I and our 2 daughters.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Soaking it up from Love this spa! I bought the Caldera Vanto at La Costa Pool & Spa in San Marcos, and I am so glad I did! I was lucky to meet the owner who sat me in every spa until I found the perfect fit in the Vanto. This spa fits tall and short people and the jets are perfect. I put off purchasing a spa because I thought it would be too much work. But this spa makes it easy. It has definitely been worth it and I know I have a reputable dealer and product should I need anything along the way. Thanks Caldera!\nRated 5 out of 5 by One Life from Great Feeling The thought of being able to get into my Caldera spa after work makes me start relaxing immediately. I often feel the stress in my neck and shoulder area. Anticipating soaking in my spa melts my tightness away. Thank you Caldera!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Stephanie777 from Love my Caldera We previously had a spa and it was nothing compared to Caldera! Best ever!!!!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Melimey from Never thought I'd get a hot tub...... ....but so glad I did! If you've never had one you will quickly find it's so much more than just a place to relax in after a hard day's work: the therapeutic benefits of the massage jets have worked wonders (and probably saved me a few trips to the chiropractor). It's great in the winter but just as good in the summer when it's warm out.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Ron from My hottub experience We thoroughly enjoy our spa. It is an awesome replacement for the first spa I owned. My only concern after 1 year is the chrome rings on the Jets won't stay in place. After each use we have to replace 2 or 3. It's not a big deal it would be nice if they would stay in place.\nRated 5 out of 5 by SJ from Great tub! Here's what I love the most about the tub: the center area is so large that when there are 6 or more people in it our feet don't touch! That's really unusual. Everything else about the tub is perfect for us. Using it in a blizzard is fantastic.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Happy Hot Tubber from Love The Extra Seats - No Lounge! This is our third hot tub and I am so glad we chose a model without a lounge. We never used the lounge in our previous hot tubs and we love having the extra seats.\nRated 5 out of 5 by NEDaddy from Great 1st hot tub Perfect for our family of 5. Seating options for adults and kids.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Adams from Excellent Hot Tub We have had our hot for just over a year jowls and I would say it is one of the best purchases we have made.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Don from Great value for the price! Very well built spa, with a good warranty package.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Dale from Great deal on great spa Not only does this tub work great but the frog system makes maintenance a breeze. Hot Tub Heaven was great to deal with and made our choice easy. I recommend the Caldera line to anyone in the market for a new spa. Don't miss not having lounger ( by choice) for more seating area.\nRated 5 out of 5 by DebN from Great Value We bought our hot tub, at the end of the model year, so we got it for an excellent price. Initially, we had some challenges learning to get the chemicals regulated, and occasionally it still doesn't respond as expected, but most of the time it responds as expected. If it doesn't it may be time to drain it and refill. Our heating bill went up more than expected ($50.00) per month(12 month average) the sales man told us $20-25 in the summer more in the winter $35-40. The cost of chemicals is also more than expected (again we listened to the salesman), we spent about $500.00 in the first year. The tub itself is great. There are a different number of jets on each seat, and the water pressure is different strengths when set fully on. The jet strength is adjustable at the 4 main seats. Also, 2 of the 4 main seats sit a couple inches higher which means someone with a long torso and someone with a short torso can both sit comfortably with the water at a nice height (when I sit on the lower seats the water is to my chin, but when I switch to a higher seat, it hits me lower on the neck). We have not encountered any mechanical problems in 15 months.\nRated 5 out of 5 by John from It's the best purchase I have ever made I have had other hot tubs in my time. but the caldera vanto Spas is the best purchase I have ever made because it is energy efficient and easy to maintain.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Happy from Beautiful spa This spa is performing well. It is an additional 150.00 per month on the electric bill and did require an 800.00 installation cost, separate from the cost of the spa. But we love it. We use it. We consider it a little bit of vacation every day.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Skibum from Why did we wait so long to upgrade !!! Fantastic spa, water care is SO easy, maybe it's our well water but it just makes it a pleasure to know that you can open the cover and get in! Uses much less electricity then our old spa did even in the bitter cold of New Hampshire winters. Very comfortable and easy to use the controls.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Roxie17 from Wonderful Spa We love everything about our spa! One of our favorite features is the audio being Bluetooth compatable with our iPod!\nRated 5 out of 5 by BG16 from Just What We Were Looking For We purchased this Vanto model in January 2015. My wife and I use it multiple times per week. No complaints; super easy to maintain. We prefer the bench construction over the molded and contoured seats, as it allows us to choose our own seating posture. Absolutely would recommend!\nRated 5 out of 5 by CRL3418 from great spa we have been very pleased with our new hot tub. Quality and comfort are excellent and the routine care is very simple.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Clearly from Amazing purchase!! This is a fantastic hot tub at a reasonable price. The jets are amazing! Kids love it too. During the summer drop it to 95 degrees the rest of the year crank it to 102!! Fantastic!\nRated 5 out of 5 by RH from Comfortable tub Relaxing and comfortable for 1 to 4 adults. Doesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles but was good value and provides a great place to sit and unwind anytime of day.\nRated 5 out of 5 by stevyb from Vanto review Great tub love it. Also very easy to use and maintain.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Ski from Love our new spa We we're looking to upgrade to a bigger house but instead decided to stay and get all the things we wanted for our current house. A spa was on that list and the Vanto is perfect. The four deep massage seats are amazing and I love that it also has 3 higher seats for when I don't want to be that submerged.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Amy A from Amazing Purchase I love my hot tub. It has helped me physically and mentally. I love relaxing in the hot tub after a long day. The jets work as well as getting a massage. I used to have tension in my neck and upper shoulders. No more. I used to suffer from migraines. No more. An amazing purchase. My family loves our hot tub as well. We spend time together as a family. This was an amazing purchase.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Jen007 from LOVE IT!!! My only regret is that I waited so long to purchase!!!! I love it, picked up a midnight job to purchase it!!! Worth every penny!!!\nRated 5 out of 5 by Peanut from Vanto Spa Review We have only had our spa about a month but so far love it! My only complaints....the light on the controller is on ALL the time. It dims but you cant turn it off. I don't like the waterfall feature so we just turn it to a trickle. Otherwise, the jets are great. The color is beautiful. I'm short so needed to find a tub that I wouldn't \"sink\" in but my husband is very tall so we had to find a tubi to fit both our height needs. This was just right! !",

    "text": "Just as I\u2019d settled down for the winter there came the rumour of some branch line closures in Austria, at the end of the current timetable in Mid December. An investigation on Hafas revealed that I could get round them all in (just) daylight at the loss of only working day, and an investigation of Ryanair revealed a reasonable fare to Linz, so off I went.\nGood to note a quiz win last night against the White Lion! Early start though, for an 07:05 departure by car to STN as I couldn\u2019t devise any way of leaving later and not getting caught in traffic. At least I proved myself right by doing so, and losing 35 minutes in the process. I still had time for a diversion to the level crossing at Offord, so that I could see a few 91s in their last day of private operation before becoming Son of BR at midnight tonight.\nOnwards to Stansted where security took exception to my rucksack and emptied it out for me before checking it for explosives and re-scanning it. In fairness though, they were very polite and offered to repack my bag if I wished. The problem apparently was that it was so closely packed (to get within Ryanair\u2019s restrictions) that the scanner couldn\u2019t see through it. Well, I\u2019m happy enough not be blown up and I was reassured by the diligence.\nOnce over that little hurdle there was time for an excellent pint of Adnam\u2019s at the airside \u2018Spoons before the inevitable Ryanair scrum and a punctual (well, 20 seconds late to be truly pedantic) departure for Linz.\nStill time at Linz Hbf for a visit to the Spar for a G\u00f6sser M\u00e4rzen and the tobacconist for a Euromillions ticket. Fingers crossed. [to no avail. I didn\u2019t get a single number].\nThe 17:30 EC (ex Klagenfurt, a warning for Monday perhaps) arrived wedged behind Gysev 1116 065. I managed to find a seat in an open though, so no problem.\nHotel (Hauser Eck) was located without problem as it\u2019s on the southern edge of the pedestrian precinct (the station [St. P\u00f6lten Hbf] is on the northern edge). Getting a meal was another matter, with the hotel booked up for music night and the only pub I could find, wedged. So I had to settle for McDs and an early return to the hotel where my channel-hopping was rewarded with a very enjoyable documentary about steam trains in the Czech Republic and Saxony!\nReasonable (08:39) start today. Fortunately I chose to get up early and so got down to breakfast just before the main influx of locusts. Goodness knows what all these people (mainly female) managed to find to do in St. P\u00f6lten on a Friday night. Staff (all one of him) completely overwhelmed but the breakfast was OK. Hotel was a bit ordinary but I suppose for \u20ac43 in this day and age, and Austria, not too bad.\nFog had been threatened by the ZAMG weather forecast and it was duly there at St P\u00f6lten. Not too bad though, with the vis at an acceptable 800m+ and by the time the 4020 had made its way to Loosdorf the sun was shining. The same applied at P\u00f6chlarn where 5047 012 was waiting in P4.\nSEV from Scheibbs to Kienberg-Gaming which is rumoured to be closing in mid December. If it does, then I\u2019ll lose the last bit; if not then I\u2019ll have to traipse out here again to do it! Bit of a double whammy but the decision was to do it today anyway because it\u2019s awkward and if it close beyond Scheibbs as threatened then it\u2019s done as far as possible.\nScheibbs has a small licensed garden shed (Kaiser) but it didn\u2019t appeal so I went for a wander round the town. Tempted into Billa on the way back I was rewarded with the really excellent Zwettler Festbier, 6.7% and tasty to match.\nA model railway shop was noted on the platform at Wieselburg an der Erlauf \u2013 also a vast modern rail-served brewery, ostensibly Kaiser. Wonder whose Wieselburger is, then?\nOnly 12 minutes at P\u00f6chlarn on the way back so not really time to visit the pleasant looking buffet (the free Gents\u2019 was useful though!). On to St P\u00f6lten in a 5 car Dosto set shoved by 1116 037.\nAlthough I was earlier than I\u2019d expected there was nothing to be gained so I decided to split the \u2018lunch hour\u2019 between St P\u00f6lten abnd Krems. Accordingly I wandered over to what seems to be the only \u2018proper\u2019 pub in St P\u00f6lten centre, the G\u00f6sser establishment just across the road from the station. I\u2019d forgotten how horrible really smoky pubs can be ... the G\u00f6sser was OK though (but over twice the price of the supermarket Festbier). The 1333 to Herzogenburg beckoned then (a 6020) so that, hopefully, is the last I\u2019ll see of St P\u00f6lten. [Three weeks later, the new \u00d6BB timetable is still showing Kienberg-Gaming with a train service, so hopes dashed, it would seem, not to mention a wasted trip to Scheibbs].\nWhile waiting at St P\u00f6lten I was surprised to see a DB101 hauling an internal \u00d6BB service (Wien-Salzburg). That said, last night\u2019s internal EC from Klagenfurt to Wien had a Gysev loco.\nTo Krems on an S40, changing at Herzogenburg, which is currently a major shambles, on to a 5047 or some such. There was time for a wander at Krems \u2013 the station may be ugly on a Birmingham New Street scale, but what a nice town. There\u2019s a lot more activity there on a Saturday than there is at St P\u00f6lten. After a brief supermarket visit (Wieselburger Gold) it was another 5047, 011 this time, for Sigmundsherberg. Turned out I\u2019d slightly miscalculated the daylight \u2013 a desperate phot just about worked at Horn at 16:30 but it\u2019s not looking too good at 16:41 for the 16:43 departure, Still, better dark than not at all \u2013 and it isn\u2019t quite! It is incidentally a typical valley line most of the way from Krems but with a change to far more open land after Rosenburg. Quite well patronised, and with everything in apple pie order as usual. Plank am Kamp in particular was very smartly, and it seemed recently, repainted.\nThen it got better... quite a posh looking restaurant on the station approach, which didn\u2019t look suitable for an itinerant scruff looking for a swift(ish) \u2018alf. Down to the bottom therefore, turned left to find a chenist\u2019s shop followed by nothing. Turned back, to find that the lights I had thought were part of the posh restaurant were in fact a Zwettler pub next door. Naturally I crashed straight in, to find a very smart and friendly pub which was a perfect venue for my 40 minute wait. Interesting to note some of the older bods in very traditional dress (and to see same on sale in the shops in Krems, too).\nFinal train was to Gm\u00fcnd in the dark. The hotel was easily located \u2013 leave by the subway to Alberchtserstrasse, turn left, cross the level crossing and you\u2019re there. Perfect. Friendly gaffer with a bit of English, making for a very useful establishment which might merit another visit when I come back to do the track in daylight.\nDown town then for some food \u2013 the usual wide choice boiled down to Hopfel in the main square. A range of Schremser beers (I tried the ordinaire) and an unfiltered one also from Schremser, allegedly a special for the pub. Heard that before, but tried it anyway. It was unexceptional in both formats. The pork medallions were just the job though!\nNot a particularly comfortable night as I couldn\u2019t find anything to turn the heating off! Early doors for the 06:17 to Schwarzenau, still dark unfortunately. Dawn\u2019s just starting to show but we\u2019ll still be shy of the \u2018one field\u2019 target.\nJust about one field by Schwarzenau, not that it mattered. Excitement at the appearance of the 5047 in the main line P2 instead of the south side bay P11 as advertised, tempered by the realisation that the Waidhofen line goes off northwards!\nA nice little branch it is too, running as a parallel single line for quite a distance eastwards out of Schwarzenau before dropping away to the north and climbing to Waidhofen. [This was another possible closure which appears not to be happening].\nBack at Schwarzenau the 35 minute connection afforded me time to walk down the road and photograph 2016 019 outside the small depot. The 08:15 to Gm\u00fcnd surprised me by being three loco hauled \u010cD coaches (the loco was Austrian but I didn\u2019t note what it was). Also seen was a 5047 going to Zwettl \u2013 these use P21 which is the north west end of P1, so do the physical connection. Good news, when I get round to it.\nNext move was to Wien [well, that was the plan] behind 1044 040 which turned up with four fairly horrendous ex-IC compartment coaches. A very uneventful run then, scenery or anything else, to Absdorf-Hippersdorf. On the way I\u2019d worked out that I could do the north bank line from A-H to Stockerau instead of the already done route via Tulln, so I baled out in favour of an 1116 and a dosto set to Stockerau. It obligingly went across the layout to terminate in P1 eliminating any later grief. The connection therefrom was a 4020 working an S9 to Praterstern.\nPreserved 93 1403 was noted parked among some wagons at Korneuberg. But more importantly, breakfast was obtained from the Anker shop at Floridsdorf! Having had this I was so pleased that I composed a text to H to tell her about it, thus losing concentration and almost letting the S1 to G\u00e4nserndorf go!\nVery slow going to G\u00e4nserndorf, arriving about 7 late. Slow round Sussenbrunn (surely not still suffering the effects of the fire?) and from Deutsch Wagram (bustituted for the next two weekends so presumably moleworks).\nStill 35 minutes or so at G\u00e4nserndorf so I wandered up to the Turkish pub (see 7.8.08) which was of course closed. Seeing the main road nearby, an inspiration suggested there might be a garage, and it might sell beer. There was, and it did. Stiegl for \u20ac1.88, amongst other things. It even had a bar, but I thought that a bridge too far!\n5047 049 duly arrived from Gross Schweinbarth and worked the 12:47 back. The connection from Wien arrived almost 10 late (in fact with 15 seconds to spare) so had I waited for that one I\u2019d have been more than worried.\nA slightly surprising ride to GS \u2013 a lightly engineered line, which wasn\u2019t surprising, but it runs past a large number of \u2018nodding donkeys\u2019. Seeing the first one or two I\u2019d assumed they were for irrigation but when you get up close you can see the logo of OMV [Austria\u2019s national oil company], suppliers of petrol and (to me a few minutes ago) beer. I don\u2019t think the scale is sufficient to make Austria self-sufficient, somehow. [In fact I was right \u2013 it supplies only a small fraction of the country\u2019s needs].\n4 minute connection at Gross Schweinbarth which turned up 2 minutes early so only just time for a phot. 5047 033 was the leading one of the pair. Quite why 049, the G\u00e4nserndorf one, buffered up to 2070 049 I don\u2019t know (nor do I know why the 2070 was there, in the middle of nowhere).\nVery nice ride up to Sulz Museumsdorf (was Sulz-Nexing according to the old station nameboard). It\u2019s a 100% agricultural area though and despite its convenience (runs alongside the main street in one village) it\u2019s easy to see it as a target for the bean counters. As is the inevitable way of these things there\u2019s a nice looking pub across the road from the station but with 15 minutes including wandering about and photting time \u2013 no.\nOnce past Gross Schweinbarth [on the way back] there are a lot more nodding donkeys along the line to Obersdorf \u2013 along with vines, fruit trees, assorted crops and wind turbines. They certainly keep their options open. Also noted at Pillichsdorf was a brand new penny farthing [bicycle] \u2013 that\u2019s certainly not anything I\u2019ve seen before.\nAnd now I know what \u2018Obersdorf hst.\u2019 is about. If Sulz Museumsdorf does indeed close, the dead end line from G\u00e4nserndorf to Obersdorf, reversing at Gross Schweinbarth, would seem very vulnerable. [Again checking just before the alleged closure date, it seems that this line completes a quartet of non-closures, making my trip futile from that point of view!] That said there seemed to be quite a few who like me, left the branch train to join the 6020 for Wien from the high level station on the line from Laa an der Thaya, so maybe there\u2019s enough through traffic. It\u2019s certainly not a line for scenic attractions \u2013 flat as a pancake from GS to Obersdorf.\nDoing the change of plan at Absdorf-Hippersdorf and doing the Sulz lines east to west instead of west to east has (if the 6020 manages to stagger to Wien S\u00fcdbf) gained me half an hour and a chunk of track, so very worthwhile despite my general aversion to changing the plan on the fly.\nAnd so to Wien S\u00fcdbf, collect some food and a couple of beers and settle down for 4 hours of dead track in the dark on IC537, catchily named Alpen-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt even though it goes to Villach. A dreadful long slog even with the assistance of Messrs G\u00f6sser, Ottakringer and iPod. Once past Wiener Neustadt it was dark; the train was full but not wedged and I had an \u2018aircraft\u2019 seat to myself throughout (no, I didn\u2019t leave my bag on the other seat). I could have done without all the coughs and sneezes from in front of me but I\u2019m still here! The only thing that made it dreadful was the suffocating heat. It amazes me that the Austrian nation hasn\u2019t become extinct in such unpleasant and unhealthy conditions! To my relief the train arrived on time at Klagenfurt, where there was plenty of fresh air to be had on the 20 minute (plus another 5 getting slightly lost) walk to the hotel. Food was dispensed with, it looking too much like hard work at 21:00 on a Sunday.\nNo English to be had this morning (and an undercharge on the bill which had them after me for another \u20ac5). Generally a nice hotel though (Liebetegger) and I\u2019d stay there again. Pleasant morning for the stroll down to the station, noting the Christmas decorations which are far more restrained and seemly than ours. Called at Spar for water supplies; for future reference there\u2019s a Billa next to the station as well. Provided it\u2019s a day when Austria\u2019s open of course. Also noted was \u2018Kleinbahn\u2019, a model railway shop on the west (left going into town) side of Bahnhofstrasse, 5 minutes or so from the station. And of course, the (still) shut homebrew pub 100m from the station! [It shut 20 minutes before I arrived the previous night and hadn\u2019t opened again when I left on the Monday].\nInteresting quirk when EC114\u2019s stock arrived by DB\u2019s first of class 101 001. I dived in to wait in comfort (and make sure of a decent seat!). This was DB IC stock and all the reservation signs (the electronic ones) said \u2018GGF RESERVIERT\u2019. No paper ones to be seen in my coach of choice, and I was baffled. I had the bright idea of asking, so wrote it down and trotted off to find an English speaking \u00d6BB person. Found one on the platform \u2013 he said he hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what it meant. Decided that I\u2019d go for it anyway and in a different coach found paper labels of the traditional kind. So it looks like \u2018Ggf. Reserviert\u2019 means \u2018I\u2019m not working, read the paper ones\u2019.\nAn excellent ride to Bischofshofen \u2013 lakes, mountains, long tunnels, steep gradients, the whole works. It\u2019s fairly (no, very) leisurely, but when you look at the landscape that\u2019s reasonable enough. I was quite surprised to see a car carrier service through the Tauern tunnel given that there\u2019s a parallel motorway. Punctuality was good, never worse than 3 late and we ran into Schwarzach-St Veit just astern of IC515 which was running in off the Salzburg line. I decided to stick with EC114 in case Schweers & Wall\u2019s interpretation (physical junction east of the station) was correct though I never did work it out. Easy connection into 515 which ran into P3 at Bischofshofen just after I got there from P5. It was formed from DB ex-IR stock which though still comfortable is looking decidedly tatty inside despite the external repaint.\nWe were delayed 8 minutes waiting the M\u00fcnchen-Klagenfurt EC which was 20 minutes late. Hopefully no consequences of lost paths, but we\u2019ll see. 1044 049 is the haulage.\nNone. A nice gentle plod through the mountains, arriving about 6 late for my 40 minute connection. Into the buff for a beer (open until 14:00 this time \u2013 see 30.08.09) only to find it only sells no-alcohol \u2018beer\u2019. Off to the village \u2013 two of the three pubs shut and no time left for the other one which was more of an amusement arcade anyway. The tobacconist was on his 12:00-14:45 lunch \u2013 nice work if you can get it. So I returned empty handed to 4024 065 on the 13:21 REX to Linz for the final track of the trip.\nNot the most inspiring run on a very grey afternoon though it\u2019s still quite spectacular in the upper reaches. Further down towards the Danube it\u2019s flood plain land, pretty dull. The new alignment between Kirchdorf and Wartberg is now in use; as there\u2019s a new Nu\u00dfbach station I assume the old one\u2019s gone \u2013 add one to the \u2018too late\u2019 list. Can\u2019t help wondering if the moleworks which foiled us in August were the commissioning of the new line.\nSo to Linz, looking pretty dismal on a grey Monday but at least it has places to eat! A very nice schnitzel was supplied by the Caf\u00e9 de Paris \u2013 I doubt I could have eaten it all even with more time... Made the 15:57 to H\u00f6rsching OK, so there\u2019s just the challenge of the free bus.\n1116 031 was the haulage, not that I note these things. No problem with the minibus \u2013 as I\u2019d hoped, an English speaker on the phone and the bus arrived in 5 minutes or so. Others please copy!\nNo further railway interest for this trip \u2013 back to the UK on Ryanair (with the beastly fanfare at Stansted) then a long trundle home in the car, beset by temporary overnight roadworks on A14 and M6 which caused me quite a bit of delay.\nIn one sense this trip was a complete waste of time in that none of the threatened closure seem to have materialised. On the other hand three of the four are done now, and the great majority of the daylight hours were spent on new track so it was pretty productive. It also filled in the long stretches Spittal-Millst\u00e4ttersee to Schwarzach-St Veit and Bischofshofen-Selzthal-Traun which as far as the \u00d6BB system\u2019s concerned, leaves me only fairly restricted areas in the eastern and southern parts of the country to cover. And as I don\u2019t work Fridays it only cost me one day\u2019s holiday!\nThat really was it for 2009. Another major plandampf was planned in Germany for April 2010 and we set our sights on that.",

    "text": "N.B. If any minutes were taken of the meeting in 1985 then they have long since been lost. These two articles, authored by Katherine, cover all of the content of her talk, and more.\nAs anthropologists, most of us would agree with Bruner that \"our first responsibility is to respect people's accounts of their experiences as they choose to present them\" (1983:9). However, those of us interested in historical anthropology face a special challenge since we are rarely able to draw upon indigenous accounts of everyday life. Even when we are able to use such texts, the problem of ethnographic authority remains (Clifford 1988:8; Clifford and Marcus 1986). Considerable work is being done in historical anthropology in reconstructing indigenous histories by using the early narratives of Western observers. However, such efforts have obvious problems of observer bias (see Cohn 1987:136-171; Said 1978; Savage 1984). Furthermore, as in the descriptions discussed in this article, the outside observers have sometimes recorded opposing opinions. How are we, as anthropologists writing today, to assess such conflicting appraisals? Using the case of textiles in 19th-century northern Thailand, I should like to suggest that by reconstructing the political economy of a society, we can evaluate contradictory historical descriptions.\nFrom Veblen (1912) and Simmel (1957) to Weiner and Schneider (1989), an appreciation of the varied manner in which textiles symbolize social distinctions has been longstanding. As Bourdieu has written of symbolic goods in general, textiles can be an integral part of the \"infinitely varied art of marking distances\" (1984:66; see also Barthes 1984; Sahlins 1976). Often the distinctions are extremely subtle. Writing of the use of fashion, Barthes notes the importance of details as \"concentrated meaning\" (1984:185). For Barthes, just a detail can change an object's meaning: \"a little nothing that changes everything; those little nothings that can do everything\" (1984:243). However, more than just symbolizing distinctions, textiles have also been shown to constitute and consolidate social differences through their often vital role in a society's political economy. In his pioneering article on tributary textiles in the Inca kingdom, Murra notes not only that \"no political, military, social, or religious event was complete without textiles being volunteered or bestowed, burned, exchanged, or sacrificed,\" but also that cloth served as \"a primary source of state revenues\" (1962:722).\ninsights into the semiotics of consumption and an important methodology for historical anthropology.\nOthers have made a similar point (see Schneider 1987 for an excellent review of the cultural, economic, and political significance of cloth). As Weiner and Schneider summarize, architects of centralizing polities have awed spectators with sartorial splendor, strategically distributed beautiful fabrics amongst clients, and exported the textile output of royal and peasant workshops to earn foreign exchange\" (1989:2).\nContradictory assessments of dress also occur in 19th-century descriptions of northern Thai dress. The anonymous author of one of the earliest surviving accounts remarked on the lack of class distinction in women's clothing: \"It is curious to notice the uniformity and universality of the female dress. The higher classes vary the style a little by inserting a very showy strip of wrought silk next above the bottom piece\" (Bangkok Recorder 1866). Twenty years later, an American missionary working in northern Thailand wrote in almost identical wording: \"Rich and poor all dress alike, except that the higher classes vary the universal style a little by inserting a very showy strip of wrought silk into the skirt near the bottom\" (Cort 1886:348).\nThus, depending upon the archival source, contemporary scholars can reach opposing assessments of the character of these earlier societies. Research on textiles in mainland Southeast Asia is just beginning (see Brown 1980; Cheesman 1988; Fraser-Lu 1988; Lefferts 1988, 1990; Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman 1987). Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman's Lanna Textiles: Yuan, Lue, Lao (1987) is the only full-length work on textiles in northern Thailand; as such it is an important preliminary study, especially useful for describing some of the items woven and the techniques used. In this article, I examine the broader social context of textile consumption and production, drawing upon two major kinds of sources, archival and oral. The archival sources include consular reports (primarily British), 19th century newspaper accounts, travelogues, and works by American missionaries. In addition I have interviewed hundreds of villagers over the age of 80 living throughout the Chiang Mai Valley of northern Thailand.5 I use archival sources primarily for insight into the consumption, production, and acquisition of textiles by the elite; I rely more heavily on oral histories for insights into the everyday life of villagers. Based upon an understanding of the social processes of textile production and consumption, I argue that the controversy generated by the contradictory opinions of certain 19th century observers of northern Thai society can be resolved in favor of those who asserted that there were dramatic differences of dress and class in the northern Thai semiotics of consumption.\nThe Chiang Mai Valley was the site of the largest and most important of the northern Thai kingdoms. These kingdoms were located in the region today called northern Thailand but called \"Western Laos\" by 19th century missionaries and other foreign observers. The courts of the various principalities were located in the mountain valleys of Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Lampang, Phrae, Nan, and Chiang Rai, each today serving as a provincial capital. Although these kingdoms were independent, they had been tributary to the neighboring kingdom of Burma for several hundred years. During the 19th century, they were tributary to the central Thai court at Bangkok; thereafter they were incorporated into Thailand.\nThis article is divided into two parts. In the first, I examine the cultural significance of textile consumption in 19th century northern Thailand. I present some of the surviving descriptions of dress, ranging from the daily wear of commoners to the state robes of the ruling lords, and subsequently expand the discussion from dress to other applications of textiles, arguing that there were dramatic differences between peasants and lords in this broader sphere as well. In the second part of the article, I describe how this differentiation between elites and commoners was revealed in the social process of textile production. Focusing on the two most important textiles used; cotton and silk, I consider the overall importance of textiles in the political economy of these northern Thai kingdoms, noting the role of tribute and slave labor in the acquisition of textiles by the elite.\nPrevious studies have shown that 19th-century northern Thai society was divided into three major social statuses: the aristocrats (jao), the freeholders (phrai), and the slaves (khiikhaa). The aristocracy was internally differentiated by economic and political power. The greatest power and prestige were concentrated in those lords who occupied the five top positions in each of the kingdoms, while lesser members of the aristocracy whose inheritances had dwindled were barely separable from the peasantry at large. Free villagers were all liable to perform corv\u00e9e labor and pay tribute to the ruling lords, but they were internally differentiated according to economic class. The wealthiest villagers rivaled many members of the aristocracy; in fact, many had royal titles and intermarried with the lower levels of the aristocracy. Villagers spanned the economic continuum, from those with land and numerous animals down to those who were destitute or landless beggars. The difference between slaves and free villagers was also often a gray area. Elite slaves sometimes worked very closely with their lords and received more benefits than ordinary commoners. On the other hand, the conditions for ordinary slaves were generally worse than those for commoners since the former were at the mercy of the lords. (For more on 19th century northern Thai social structure, see Bowie 1988; Calavan 1974; Ganjanapan 1984.) Nonetheless, although portions of this social spectrum overlapped, there were significant differences in lifestyle from one end of the spectrum to the other.\nTo give an idea of the purchasing power of a rupee at this time, some indications of wage rates are suggestive. Although very few statistics on northern Thai wage labor rates survive, I was able to find three references in the archival sources.16 According to the British trade report of 1894, porters were paid 12 to 15 rupees per month, assuming they carried an average load of 15 to 20 viss; about 54 to 73 pounds (Archer 1895). Some figures on the wages paid to laborers in the teak industry also survive. According to W. J. Archer, the British vice consul, Khamu workers who could once be hired for 40 to 60 rupees a year (and their food) could in 1894 no longer \"be had under Rs. 70 to Rs. 90 a year\" (1895). Writing five years later, Acting Consul J. Stewart Black gave somewhat lower wage figures, while also lamenting the increasing costs. He noted that Khamu workers were paid 30 to 50 rupees per annum, in addition to their food, which cost about 5 rupees per month, or an additional 60 rupees per year. Black wrote that in 1899 some teak laborers were being paid as much as 120 rupees (food included) and went on to castigate the native villagers for their indolence, commenting that \"not even the attraction of what is to him [sic] a small fortune will induce them to undergo for any length of time the hard labour and isolation of forest work\" (1 900).17 Thus, forest workers in the teak industry were earning anywhere from 90 to 120 rupees per year (including the value of their food), or about 7 to 10 rupees per month. Such wages paid to forest workers were considered a \"small fortune.\" Although the wages paid to porters were higher, it should be noted that portering such heavy loads required tremendous stamina and could be done by only the strongest villagers. Furthermore, such employment was seasonal.\nAccording to oral histories, the wages paid to agricultural workers were less. Many villagers cited rates of one win (approximately one-seventh of a rupee) per day for agricultural labor at the turn of the 20th century.18 Archival sources suggest that wages for teak workers averaged one-quarter to one-third of a rupee per day and those for porters averaged half a rupee per day. Villagers also recalled that in the early 20th century one rupee could buy a full set of clothing, including a homespun shirt and pair of pants or skirt.\nClearly, the aristocracy's most luxurious clothes were not likely to serve as daily casual wear. Nonetheless they marked a significant distinction in purchasing power and social status between the elite and ordinary villagers. A tin jok skirt border that cost 60 rupees represented at least four months' wages for the best-paid porter and over a year's wages for agricultural workers. Everyday peasant dress already represented anywhere from two to seven days' wages and thus constituted a considerable expense for the ordinary wage laborer.\nThe ruling lords of the northern Thai kingdom also had distinctive regalia, including umbrellas and spittoons. Whether a formal sumptuary code existed is, as I mentioned earlier, unclear. However, even without the evidence of sumptuary laws, I believe that there is considerable indication of significant class differentiation through dress.19 With the exception of state robes and regalia of rank, differences in dress may well have formed a continuum of wealth rather than a clear-cut differentiation based on status. Poorer members of the aristocracy, less able to afford the most elaborate of clothes, would have blended with those below them. Conversely, wealthier members of the rural elite, especially those who had intermarried with the lower ranks of the aristocracy, would have dressed more ornately. Nonetheless, overall, when one considers the cost of elite dress in light of the economic situation of poor villagers who were begging, stealing, or patching their simple clothing, a dramatic distinction emerges.\nTextiles were used not only for dress but also for a variety of household items and on various ritual occasions. Such uses of textiles also revealed considerable differences according to wealth. Although the poorest villagers often did without, ordinary villagers used textiles for making mattress and pillow covers, blankets, bed sheets, and mosquito nets. In general the mattress and pillow covers were plain indigo or black with red stripes or trim. Bed sheets were plain white or white with a red stripe or checked pattern; fancier sheets had embroidery and in some cases more complex weaves. Mosquito nets were woven on special large looms, and many informants complained about how heavy homespun cotton mosquito nets were to wash.\nCloth also figured importantly in the lives and rites of the elite. In addition to owning more and fancier clothes, the elite had more and better household items. Instead of just having enough mattresses, pillows, and other bedding items for the family, wealthier families had additional bedding sets for guests. Furthermore, the guest bedding was considered an object of display and so was more likely to have embroidered ends and complex, time-consuming weaves. Even today wealthy village families usually have wood cabinets with glass doors along the wall of the main room of their home to showcase guest bedding sets.\nThe possession of ornate pillows was another particularly significant attribute of elite households. Although Thais had a variety of pillows, the prestige pillows were usually triangular and were used for daytime reclining. Their importance was highlighted in a British official's passing remark that such pillows were \"to be seen in every house of any pretensions\" (Lowndes 1871).25 Furnishing their palaces, the northern Thai princes displayed numerous luxury items such as foreign-made weapons, chandeliers, mirrors, lanterns, curtains, reclining pillows, and even imported carpets (Taylor 1888-1930:73; Younghusband 1888:63-64). In 1830 Richardson noted the presence of Indian and Chinese carpets (1829-36:63), and in 1885 Ernest Satow recorded that the ruling lord of Chiang Mai had European furniture and \"a number of gaudy Brussels carpets\" (1885-86:51).\nThe full extent of the differences between commoners and aristocracy was most visible when members of the ruling elite traveled in state or participated in public ceremonies. Royal barges had large cloth canopies: the royal barge of the central Thai king, according to one observer, featured \"a canopy of cloth of gold where the King sits on a golden throne wearing a gold embroidered coat and golden shoes\" (Dodd 1923:289). The royal entourage often consisted of scores of boats, the rowers all clad in matching uniforms. The elite also traveled by horse or elephant, the animals gaily festooned with decorative textiles. On state occasions, the highest ranks of the nobility used gold and silver decorative caparisons. Mary Cort noted that the gold elephant trappings were \"worth thousands,\" whereas the silver trappings were \"worth hundreds\" of rupees (Cort 1886:349).\nIn addition to making public prestations such as those at the Kathin ceremonies, the elite would have given considerable amounts of textile goods away during any other life-cycle or calendrical ceremonies they might hold. Thai ceremonials usually included a merit-making component in which gifts, including monastic robes and embroidered pillows, were given as offerings to the monks (see Davis 1984). Archival sources also note the use of textiles as gifts to visiting dignitaries: the gifts given to Satow, a British official, by the ruling chief of Lampang included velvet mattresses, pillows adorned with Chinese brocade, and silk skirts (Satow 1885- 86:206). Thus, not only did the peasants and the lords differ considerably in terms of dress and household possessions, but they also differed in the extent to which they donated textiles on ritual occasions.\nIn this article thus far I have depicted significant differences between the elite's and the peasants' uses of textiles. I have described a range of dress: from the stolen and the hand-me-down, from the threadbare and the patched, from the simple cottons of commoners to the state robes of the ruling lords. I have also outlined some of the different uses of textiles in village households as opposed to the court. Here, I should like to show how the differentiation was manifested not simply in the consumption of textiles but also in their production.\nAs will become clear, both accounts are true; the differences lie in the type of fabric being woven.\nMost clothing was made from cotton. However, contrary to what is commonly assumed, weaving was not a universal household industry; only certain villagers in certain villages wove (see Bowie 1988, 1992). The weaving of simple cotton cloth was spread quite widely throughout the Chiang Mai Valley, and certain districts were especially known for their concentrations of weavers. Those districts that had a reputation for cotton weaving in the past, especially the San Kamphaeng and Bo sang districts, have maintained their reputations down to the present. Furthermore, oral histories reveal weaving to have been a highly specialized activity, with different villagers involved in the different phases of production. By far the most commonly produced cloth was a plain white cotton, often later dyed with indigo. The villagers most likely to produce such cloth were the poorer ones, who wove both for their own household needs and for sale or hire. Such village weavers were more likely to find weaving an onerous obligation from which others were freed.\nFrom the simplest and plainest of homespun white cloth to the most elaborate designs using imported fibers, the value of the fabric gradually increased. Striped or plaid cloth involved more work and skill, in both weaving and dyeing, than plain cloth and was consequently valued more highly. Cloth woven with imported threads, most often used for women's phaa sins, was more expensive than the domestic handspun cotton. The wealthier the village weaver, the more likely she was to weave the more time-consuming decorative items such as colored skirts or striped sheets. The more elaborate the design, the more likely the weaver was weaving for pleasure with a \"cool heart.\"\nThe more complex the weave, the more likely that the weaver was affiliated in some manner with the aristocracy, as war captive, slave, or member of the court. Virtually each of the areas known for weaving is associated with an ethnic minority brought into the Chiang Mai Valley as war captives sometime during the 19th century. Baan Ton Hen is a Khyyn village; San Kamphaeng (particularly around the original district town of Baan Oon) is also known as a Khyyn area. The Khyyn are a population who originally lived in the Chiang Tung area: Chiang Mai led attacks on Chiang Tung in 1849, 1852-53, and 1854, and it seems people were brought back on these occasions (Wilson and Hanks 1985:29). Over half of the people living in the Lamphun region are said to have descended from war captives (Freeman 1910:100). Chom Thong town has a Lawa population, many of whom served as temple slaves. Unfortunately, I was unable to acquire any information about the ethnic background of villagers in Baan Aen since the entire village was forced to relocate when a hydroelectric dam was built.\nUnlike villagers, who had to weave, trade for, or buy their clothing, the ruling lords were able to extract raw cotton, woven cloth, and dyestuffs as tribute. Their ability to levy tribute on broad sectors of the population provided the aristocracy with a quantity of cotton cloth no single producer could hope to match. Interestingly, the majority of villagers who sent cotton or cloth as tribute appear to have been hilltribe populations, such as the Karen and the Mussur (today more commonly called the Lahu). One of the Karen villages that Captain Thomas Lowndes visited in 1871 had just taken its year's taxes to Chiang Mai: \"it consisted of Rupees 2, 2 blankets, and 40 viss of cotton\" (1871). Richardson also noted tribute of cloth paid by the Karen during his travels in 1830 (1829-36:37, 45). Captain McLeod found that the KaKuis had to make presents of mats and cloths to the lords (1836:57). McGilvary commented that much of the raw cotton being purchased by the Yunnanese traders came from the Mussur; although he did not specifically mention tribute, it is likely that the Mussur too would have been expected to offer tribute to the ruling lords in the form of raw cotton or finished cloth. While the aristocracy were able to make apparently generous donations on ritual occasions, much of what they gave was in fact the contribution of others.\nThus, the aristocracy appear to have been able to extract raw cotton, simple cotton cloth, and complex cotton weaves through political means. Tribute afforded them both raw cotton and cotton cloth, and the labor of war captives seems to have provided them with complex weaves such as tin jok skirt borders. Although silk was considered a more valuable fabric, cotton cloth nonetheless had a variety of uses in royal households. The tin jok borders, even those made of cotton, would have marked their wearers as wealthier than ordinary villagers, who only wore plain skirt borders. Possession of textiles ranging from mattresses to elephant headpieces made from complex woven cotton would have similarly served to add to the prestige of their owners. Such cloth could be used as rewards for favored underlings or as gifts for visitors. In addition, cotton cloth made possible the public display of largess involved in merit-making ceremonies, since monks' robes were typically made from cotton.\nIt is also possible that royalty were involved in the cotton trade. There was considerable demand for raw cotton by Yunnanese traders and some demand for cotton cloth in Burma (Bowie 1992; Hill 1982; Reid 1988:91). British vice consul Archer mentioned in his trade report of 1894 that \"women's cloths of coarse cotton, woven by the Laos [were] sought after in Burma as being very durable,\" although he added that the export was not very considerable (1895). Such cloth, together with silk goods, could also have been offered as tribute to other kingdoms. However they used it, lords - because they could exact tribute and slave labor - found it much easier to acquire cloth than did commoners, who had to weave fabric themselves or find some other means of acquiring it.\nArchival sources also indicate that royal slaves were involved in silk weaving. The British official A. H. Hildebrand noted, \"There is a good deal of trade capable of being done also in silk garments and silk fancy work, at which the slaves and others are great adepts\" (1875). It is not clear whether these slaves lived solely at the court or also in slave settlements established to produce cloth for the court. Silk weaving is known to have been done in only two areas outside the court itself: the towns of San Kamphaeng and Hot (and their immediate environs). While silk weaving continues to this day in San Kamphaeng, in Hot only traces survive in archival sources and in the memories of the town's oldest residents. No information survives to explain why Hot, a town some 70 kilometers from Chiang Mai, would have been a center of silk production and weaving, or why the industry died out. (Villagers said it was because the cocoons scared easily and so had died.) However, in San Kamphaeng a senior member of one of the prestigious silk-weaving families recounted the local version of the history of silk weaving in his area. According to his account, lords victorious in war would capture various kinds of artisans and resettle them in their own kingdoms. Thus, silversmiths were settled near the south end of Chiang Mai town, lacquer ware artists in another location, and weavers in San Kamphaeng. This account indeed suggests that the silk weavers in San Kamphaeng may have been royal slaves weaving at the behest of the court.\nSome idea of the potential scale of royal weaving was given by D. J. Edwardes, who wrote that the ruling lord of Chiang Mai had 300 slaves weaving cloth for him (1875). It appears that these Chiang Mai silks were marketed in Burma. In his summary of the Chiang Mai kingdom, Lowndes commented: \"Weaving and embroidery are the principal handicrafts, the silk putsoes [phaa nung] are much sought after by the Burmans, as they wear three times as long as those of Burmese manufacture\" (1871). He made a similar point about the silk woven in Hot, noting that it was \"said to be very strong and durable\" and adding, \"A thitgoung [headman] showed me a putso that he had had in wear for 7 years, and it was by no means worn out\" (1871).\nIn San Kamphaeng, where silk production has continued to the present day, raw silk was imported from Luang Prabang, Laos, and later from Mandalay, Burma. Raw silk was also routinely imported by the Haw traders coming from Yunnan, China (Hill 1982; see also Bowie 1992).\nThe geographical distribution of raw materials had social implications. Since sufficient quantities of cotton grew in upland regions of northern Thailand to be readily exported, cotton was more accessible to ordinary villagers and could, in turn, be extracted by the ruling lords through tribute. Since silkworms were not abundant in northern Thailand, raw silk had to be imported. Silk's scarcity heightened its price and its prestige value, serving to concentrate silk weaving in the hands of the court. Aristocratic control of silk production was further aided by the fact that the silk fiber is very fine and hence is far more difficult and time-consuming to weave than cotton.\nA comparison of cotton and silk production, then, reveals important contrasts. While cotton was exported, silk was imported into northern Thailand. While cotton was generally woven by freeholding villagers, silk seems to have been woven by slaves and members of the aristocracy. While villagers, except those who begged or stole their clothing, had to obtain textiles through direct economic means, aristocrats were able to augment their own production through the political means of tribute and slave labor. Furthermore, because poverty was widespread and not all villagers grew or wove cotton themselves, many villagers faced hardships in acquiring clothing of any kind for their families.\nUnderstanding the process of textile production helps contemporary readers gain insight into the cultural meaning of cloth to 19th century northern Thai. Once we understand the chronic poverty of most villagers and the difficulty with which villagers obtained even the simplest of cotton cloth, the significance of cloth in daily life and in village rituals becomes clearer. Simultaneously, we can begin to enter the cultural world of 19th century villagers to learn the social meaning of the difference between clothes made of cotton and those made of silk.\nUnderstanding the productive process also helps us appreciate the manner in which textiles were interwoven with royal authority. Because of their coercive power, the lords were able to exact cloth as tribute from freeholders and labor from slaves. Their political position reinforced their economic position, since the textiles - and other goods - they acquired through tribute and slave labor were apparently marketed for revenue. The revenue and surplus textiles they acquired through the labor of others, in turn, reinforced their political position. By sponsoring large, conspicuous merit-making ceremonies in which they gave robes and pillows to monks, the lords enhanced their prestige and, ironically, created an image of generosity. The fine silks in which the lords dressed themselves symbolized not only their distinction from the poor but also their own relationship to the political economy of the kingdom.\nCombining oral histories with archival sources, this article has examined textile consumption and production in 19th century northern Thailand. If we have an understanding of the social process of textile production, the \"concentrated meaning\" (Barthes 1984:185) of northern Thailand textiles becomes more apprehensible. Such apparently minor details of fashion as the use of a silk skirt border - or, as one early observer phrases it, \"a showy strip of wrought silk\" - can no longer be interpreted as meaning that \"rich and poor all dress[ed] alike\" (Cort 1886:346). Important differences in dress, household possessions, and ritual prestations separated the aristocracy from the peasantry. These differences signified profound differences in the relationship of each to the political economy. Thus, the semiotics of consumption in northern Thai society is illuminated by an understanding of its political economy. This article on the consumption and production of textiles in 19th century northern Thailand has been at once a description of the social context of textiles and an exercise in historical anthropology. The evaluation and appropriate application of archival sources present a challenge to every historical anthropologist, since these sources are replete with omissions and distortions. However, by interweaving oral histories with archival sources, we can recapture much of the fabric of the past. Oral histories enhance the archival sources by contributing some sense of the lived experiences of the unrecorded majority. This article has shown how developing a better understanding of a society's political economy can provide an independent means to assess the opinions of outside observers of indigenous societies.\nAcknowledgments. This article emerges from my dissertation fieldwork on 19th century political economy, conducted from 1984 to 1986 under the auspices of the National Research Council of Thailand with a grant from the Social Science Research Council. Subsequent fieldwork specifically on textile production was conducted during the summer of 1989 with a grant from the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I would like to thank Cornelia Kammerer, Jean De Bernardi, Nicola Tannenbaum, Patricia Cheesman, Songsak Prangwatthanakun, Kristine Hastreiter, Kate Bjork, Hugh Wilson, and the American Ethnologist reviewers for their various contributions toward the research and writing of this article.\n1 Edwardes' summary raises questions about Anthony Reid's conclusion that in Southeast Asia, \"the difference in dress between rich and poor, servant and master, king and commoner, was less marked than in pre-industrial Europe, where each man's station and even vocation could be read in the prescribed style of dress\" (1988:85).\n2 The distinctions of dress appear to have been quite subtle at times. Crawfurd wrote, \"The better classes permit the ends of the dress to hang loosely in front, but the lower orders tuck them under the body, securing them behind\" (1987:313).\nAlthough the older men in northern Thai villages sport tattoos, the practice has fallen out of vogue among the current generation of northerners. For more on the symbolism of tattoos, see Nicola Tannenbaum (1987).\n4 In the course of my interviewing I also encountered villagers who made mention of sumptuary rules with regard to housing and clothing, but they were unable to recall any of the specifics. The quotation cited suggests not only that sumptuary laws existed but also that they varied by ruler and kingdom.\n5 During dissertation fieldwork in 1984-86, I interviewed more than 500 villagers over the age of 80 living in about 400 villages throughout the Chiang Mai Valley. I repeatedly asked villagers for their recollections of life when they were young as well as for their memories of what their parents and grandparents had said about life in their days (see Bowie 1988). This article emerges from accidental observations made during my dissertation research. During the summer of 1989 I interviewed another 100 villagers, specifically asking about textiles.\n6 Considerable confusion is caused by the various linguistic borrowings of the 19th century English language sources, which alternately use Indian, Burmese, and central Thai words to describe northern Thai clothing. Thus, terms such as phaa nung, lungi, and putso are used in ambiguous ways. In general, these terms refer to the lengths of cloth worn by both men and women on the lower half of the body. The lengths may be sewn into a tube (as in the phaa sin) or twisted into a thick cord worn between the legs (as in the phaa toi). To add to the confusion, the usage of these terms has changed over time. During the 19th century, phaa nung referred to the length of cloth worn on the lower part of the body by central Thai men and women alike, corresponding most closely to the phaa toi worn by northern Thai men. Over time the meaning has changed to refer to the tubular cloth, or phaa sin, worn during the 19th century by northern Thai women and now worn by women throughout the country.\n8 Bock, writing in 1884, observed, \"A few Lao women are beginning to wear tight-fitting jackets, cut to the shape of the figure, with equally tight sleeves, something after the style of the 'ladies' jerseys' recently so fashionable in Paris and London, and involving no small amount of labour to get on and off\" (1986 :327). Writing at about the same time, Cort made a similar observation: \"Some are beginning to wear jackets or waists, but the usual style is for the women to have a brightly colored cotton or silk scarf tied around their chests just under the arms\" (1886:348).\n9 The indigo-dyed cotton daew chador and indigo shirts now identified as stereotypical of the Thai peasantry appear to have been of recent vintage, dating from about the turn of the century. Ironically, the blue farmer shirts (sya moh hoom) now worn by university students and Thai officials to demonstrate Thai nationalist pride seem to have been popularized by Chinese merchants. The daew chador has more in common with Chinese-style loose-fitting pants than with the traditional phaa toi. Additional support for the view that jackets became more common as the century progressed are provided in a few passing comments. In 1868 Henry Alabaster detailed his recollections of people's dress ten years earlier, noting: \"I remember that ten years ago at any of the great festivals which attracted there 40 or 50,000 spectators, almost all wore but one garment - or a sarong and scarf. Now almost every one adds thereto a cotton or silk jacket\" (1868). Stringer, writing in his trade report of 1890 specifically about northern Thailand, commented, \"The wearing of singlets and coats of European pattern by the men and cotton jackets by the women is becoming more common\" (1891).\n10 That cloth was highly valued elsewhere in Southeast Asia is also reflected in the following Burmese proverb: \"If you are on the way to an ahlu [merit-making ceremony], do not wear your jacket; carry it and put it on when you arrive; it lasts longer that way\" (Nash 1965:232).\n11 \"A comment on the poverty of temple slaves in Burma supplies further evidence that the sheer amount of cloth in one's clothing was an indication of economic status: \"They are poor these slaves, the men wear no brilliant putsoes and the women wear no vest beneath their jacket\" (Rangoon Gazette Weekly Budget 1899b).\n12 The value of cloth is also suggested in a northern Thai rhyme describing the payment that three women received in return for sexual favors: \"Miss Kum asked for silver, Miss Huan asked for cloth, Miss Noja asked for an elephant. Hurry up and finish Doctor\" (Bristowe 1976:127, cited in Patel 1990:127). Cotton's value as a commodity is seen too in the fact that there were traveling minstrels who literally \"sang for their cotton.\" A favorite form of village entertainment in the past was soh, witty and often bawdy repartee between a male and a female singer, with musical accompaniment. One especially popular form of soh was the soh kep nok, or \"singing repartee to collect birds.\" In villages with surplus raw cotton, this soh would be performed as soh laek fai (singing in exchange for cotton). Each village household wishing a performance would build a tree as a stage prop, with cotton representing the birds in the tree. At a certain point in the plot, the male singer would then \"shoot down\" all the cotton birds and put them in his bag. Having collected all the cotton balls, the performers would then move to the next house where they had been invited to perform, again receiving cotton as payment. (For more on the soh kep nok performance itself, see Shim- bhanao 1982-84).\n13 Nineteenth-century paintings have been preserved at Wat Phumin in Nan and Wat Phra Singh in Chiang Mai.\n14 Because during times of peace Chiang Tung and Chiang Mai were closely linked by trade as well as by cultural and linguistic similarities, I include these descriptions of Chiang Tung in the discussion of northern Thailand. Kun or Khynn is the name of the ethnic group living in the region around Chiang Tung (Keng Tung), many of whom were brought to Chiang Mai as war captives and resettled there.\n15 Stringer wrote that Manchester chowls, \"of which four different sizes are sold, fetch from Rs. 20 to Rs. 24 per corge of 20 pieces, and the Bombay goods, also sold in four sizes, fetch from Rs. 17 to Rs. 20 per corge\" (1891). Chowl is another word for phaa nung. According to T. Carlisle's 1899 trade report, chowl was \"the Indian name for the Siamese 'phalai' or 'paley,' that is the 'phaanung' or lower portion of the Siamese costume printed and furnished with a glaze\" (1900). In other words, it was a length of printed cloth some three to four meters long. A possibly higher figure for the price per length was given by Alabaster, who suggested that if the British could manufacture sarongs to sell retail at about 4 to 6 shillings apiece, they might find a market in Thailand (1868). Since the rupee was valued at 13 pence in 1895, this would suggest a cost of 3.7 to 5.6 rupees per length. However, I have no figures with which to calculate the shilling/rupee exchange rate for 1868.\n16 James Ingram has done a remarkable job of gathering wage labor rates for central Thailand (1964).\n17 1t is interesting that while remarking on the indolence of the natives, Black commented that it was \"not uncommon to find Khamoos working for foresters who had failed to pay their wages for 5-6 years\" (1900).\n18 Until the early part of the 20th century, the Burmese rupee (called the taep in northern Thai) was the dominant currency in northern Thailand. The Siamese (central Thai) baht only became the standard currency thereafter. The baht equaled 100 satang. The exchange rate between the Siamese baht and the Burmese rupee fluctuated but was about 80 to 90 satang per rupee (according to interviews and Archer 1895). Since a win equaled 12 satang, it was approximately equivalent to one-seventh of a rupee.\n19 The significance of sumptuary laws is ambiguous. On the one hand, the presence of such laws suggests an elite strong enough to have them passed; on the other hand, it also suggests an elite whose status is being undermined. It has been argued that in England, where a variety of such laws were passed, they represented not the strength of the aristocracy but its weakness vis-\u00e0-vis the growing fiscal strength of the bourgeoisie. Sumptuary laws have even been interpreted as the protectionist tactics of a local bourgeoisie protecting domestic production against foreign imports (see Hooper 1915). They have also been interpreted as paternalistic efforts by concerned governments to protect their citizens from profligacy (Phillips and Staley 1961).\n21 Far more remains to be said about the raw materials needed for dyeing. For more on this and other dyes, see Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman (1987) and Fraser-Lu (1988). See Schneider (1976) for a fascinating discussion of the importance of dyes in the political economy of Europe.\n22 A few of the traditional ordination pillows have survived. I saw one that was among a villager's last remaining unsold treasures; it had been made by his mother for his initiation. A triangular pillow made of black satin cloth, it had gold thread embroidered into a flower design at the points of the triangle.\n23 Cloth that has been worn as a woman's phaa sin can be very powerful symbolically. Soldiers often wore pieces from their mothers' phaa sins to protect them in battle, with the idea that their mothers had done the most to give them life and would do the most to protect them. This symbolism becomes even more intriguing when considered in light of the famous myth of Queen Chamathevi. She wove pieces of a phaa sin into a hat for a suitor to ensure that his arrows would fall short of their mark and he would thus fail in his quest for her hand in marriage. The stratagem worked.\n24 Textile production seems to have been a more important and more widespread part of the village household economy in northeastern than in northern Thailand. Consequently, I believe, cloth goods figured more prominently in wedding celebrations in the northeast.\n26 The Pali word kathina means a piece of cloth that in former times was donated to a temple for making robes; alternatively, it means the wooden frame on which the cloth was traditionally sewn into robes (Davis 1984:200).\n27 Even today kathin ceremonies are \"most often sponsored by government agencies, private companies, and wealthy families\" (Davis 1984:200).\n28 The central Thai king, King Mongkut, wore robes of yellow silk while he was a monk (Feltus 1924:53).\nRich people didn't know how to spin or weave. They bought their clothes ready-made or hired other people to weave their cloth for them. Rich people were too lazy to weave for themselves. But some rich people were stingy; they wove their own clothes instead of hiring poor people.\n30 lronically, Prangwatthanakun and Cheesman suggest that in the past \"every woman owned at least one tin chok for special occasions\" (1987:12). Because these borders required so much skill to weave and were so expensive to buy, I am quite skeptical of this claim. I think that only the wealthiest of villagers, or villagers who were themselves expert weavers, would have owned a tin jok.\n31 Hildebrand did not specify how the slaves of the second chief were employed; however, we know from Bock's account that one of the second chief's wives had her slaves spin silk. Hildebrand wrote, \"The second chief's source of income is not so calculable; he derives a good deal from the labor of his slaves, of whom, with his wives and children, he never has less than 600 under his roof, and the number outside would probably double this amount\" (1875).\n1868 Trade Report of Siam of 1867.

    "text": "I have discussed previously the locomotive assignment booklets used for a number of years by Southern Pacific, and commented about how to use such a booklet for choosing my 1953 locomotives to model (you can see it at: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/04/choosing-1953-locomotive-roster.html ). But I didn\u2019t say much in that post about the assignment booklets themselves. I want to say more in this post.\nShown below is the cover of a typical booklet, this one for March 31, 1950. These were issued quarterly, and naturally describe all locomotives on the Pacific Lines part of the SP system (the summary shows system-wide totals for all Pacific Lines divisions). You can click on the image to enlarge it.\nWithin the booklet, each division had a separate listing. I show below the two pages for the Coast Division, which is the division within which my layout is sited. Of course this division extended far beyond the area I model, from Santa Barbara in the south, to San Francisco, and thus included the entire Peninsula commuter district (at that time, spanning San Francisco-San Jose). Here is page 11 of the March 31, 1950 booklet.\nNote here that at this time there were 13 diesel switchers and 26 steam switchers, along with nine Consolidations and a Mogul also assigned to yard service, to do the division\u2019s switching. In addition to large yards at Bayshore and Santa Clara, division point yards at Watsonville Junction, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara had to be worked.\nThe second page, page 12 of the booklet, shows the remaining engines.\nIt is interesting, looking at these two pages, to see the large number of Consolidations, and the relatively small number of cab-forwards at this time, and only five A-B-B-A sets of F units. That would change as dieselization proceeded, because the new F units were preferentially assigned at first in desert and mountain regions, where their tractive effort and absence of water consumption made them big advances over steam power. Meanwhile, the displaced steam gradually migrated into California on the lesser gradient areas, including Coast Division.\nCommute service on this division accounts for the substantial number of Pacifics, Mountains and GS 4-8-4s on the roster, relative to most other SP divisions at the time.\nI have chosen my locomotive numbers from these assignments, combined with examination of yard and roundhouse photos at San Luis Obispo, the nearest locomotive facility to my layout\u2019s mythical Santa Rosalia Branch. Among the Consolidations listed on page 11, you can see numbers 2592, 2752, and 2829, all of which are on my layout. I also have an S-2 diesel switcher no. 1389, which as you can see was also on this division. The booklet shown above is for 1950, but in 1953 these same engines were still at San Luis Obispo.\nI discussed these same issues, and showed a San Luis roundhouse photo, in the post cited at the top of this post, along with showing a 1952 locomotive assignment sheet. One of the truly distinctive locomotives assigned for years at San Luis Obispo was Consolidation 2592. In the last years of its active life, it had a \u201cwhaleback\u201d tender inherited from an early cab-forward. Here is one view of the engine switching at San Luis Obispo, taken in January 1954 by Rod Crossley. Note that the road name on the side of the tender is smaller than was standard after 1946.\nThis locomotive is Class C-9, built by Baldwin in 1906, and like many Harriman Consolidations, so useful that it remained in service when newer and more modern engines were going to scrap.\nHere is my model of SP 2592, switching on my layout at Ballard. This model combines a Key brass SP 2-8-0 with a Westside brass tender, making this a distinctive locomotive. Today it also has DCC and sound, thanks to Al Massi.\nThis single locomotive example illustrates one way to use the assignment sheets, combined with photographic evidence of how locomotives were configured and even lettered, to provide a realistic part of a layout locomotive fleet.\nI have written several times about the variety of commodities carried in tank cars, and the fact that certain commodities required special cars. Of course, many edible products and many simple chemicals can be carried in general-service tank cars, AAR class TM and ICC class 103, or even in non-regulated tank cars of classes like AAR-201 and AAR-203. But many corrosive, flammable, dangerous, or poisonous commodities have regulatory limits to how they are shipped, and must be carried in certain types of tank cars suitable for those cargoes.\nA fairly complete table, occupying 14 book pages, was issued by American Car & Foundry, and was published as an Appendix to Edward S. Kaminski\u2019s book, Tank Cars, American Car & Foundry, 1865 to 1955 (Signature Press, Berkeley, 2003). But of course not everyone has that book on their shelf, even though as a partner in the publisher, I think they surely ought to own the book <grin>.\nA comparable table was published and distributed by General American Transportation Corporation, in several editions over the years. I have a copy of the one published in 1961. It is a most informative document, filled with operating directions, general arrangement drawings for complete cars, and also detail drawings of specific parts. Here is the cover (a little worn with use).\nAnyone can download the PDF for their use, or print it if desired.\nIn an upcoming column in the \u201cGetting Real\u201d column series in Model Railroad Hobbyist, I will be discussing tank car construction and details, as well as usage, and this commodity table will be one of the tools to identify cars with cargoes.\nIt\u2019s my hope that this table will be use to modelers who wish to correctly marry their tank car models with appropriate waybills for suitable cargoes. That is the main way I use either one of the two tables (from AC&F or General American), and there are only a few differences in detail between the two.\nAmong the refrigerator car owners from which Pacific Fruit Express borrowed cars during the PFE peak harvest months was Fruit Growers Express. These borrowed reefers could be any available cars from the entire FGEX fleet, including associated fleets from the Burlington (BREX) and Great Northern (WFEX), fleets which were operated by Fruit Growers as fully part of the FGEX fleet. For this reason, I need to model some of these cars. I already have on my roster a steel BREX car and wood-sheathed cars from WFEX and FGEX. But I could use one or two more.\nA number of years ago, at a swap meet, I saw a fairly nicely assembled reefer from a Red Ball kit (or I believe that was the origin), for one of the Pennsylvania Railroad R7 refrigerators. It had been painted in a layout owner\u2019s paint scheme of white sides with a horizontal blue frame stripe, but didn\u2019t look too bad otherwise. The price was right, just one dollar as I recall, so I bought it.\nI knew that when the PRR had joined Fruit Growers in the 1920s, the existing R7 cars had been transferred to FGE ownership. This car, as many know, was the refrigerator version of the X23 box car, with a complex pressed-steel exterior frame, built starting in 1913. This makes the exterior of the R7 visually striking, and I thought this would be an interesting addition to my FGEX fleet.\nI should quickly interject that I know perfectly well this model falls far short of the beautiful Westerfield kit for these cars (kit 1160x, with the \u201cx\u201d being a number for three different roof versions available), and these are in stock as far as I know (you can check availability on their website, at http://www.westerfieldmodels.com/ ). But this is not a central part of my reefer fleet, so I\u2019m willing to accept the compromises of this version. You may of course reach the opposite conclusion for your fleet.\nIt was easy to mask the boxcar red roof and ends and repaint the sides a golden yellow, as Fruit Growers used. Lettering was the next challenge. Although I am not aware of a decal sheet exactly for these R7 cars, the excellent Speedwitch Media set D119.1, for 1948-era paint, looked like it would work. These cars had been put into the FGEX number series 43500\u201346999, and even in the 1950s, some of these cars soldiered on in Fruit Growers service. Below is a prototype photo, taken in Sioux City, Iowa on September 30, 1952 (from the Bob\u2019s Photo collection, used with permission). The car at left is notably taller. The R7 car height was not unusual in 1913, but cars gradually got taller and taller in the ensuing 50 years, up to my modeling year of 1953.\nI chose a car number within the series noted above, and applied the decals, then weathered the model to suggest a car with lengthy service since it was last painted. In the photo below, notice how much shorter the car is, compared to the PFE steel reefer to its left, just like the photo above.\nIn service, these cars were limited by their small interior height and lack of floor racks, plus relatively thin insulation. They were accordingly used for dense cargoes like potatoes, or cargoes not requiring low transit temperatures, such as onions. I will waybill them accordingly on my layout, and am pleased to have one of these distinctive cars in my freight car fleet.\nMost of us have a stash of kits and materials, sometimes impressively large (I\u2019ve known modelers whose stash rivaled a small hobby shop), others much less so. And most of us know that an awful lot of the stuff is not going to get built or the materials used. That\u2019s more obvious with a huge stash, where a program of building at a rate of a kit a week might require a decade or more at that rate to make a sizable dent in the total. But even a smaller stash may contain a fair amount of stuff that no longer fits your needs or interests.\nI should say right away that I have no problem with kit collectors. I have known some, and was truly impressed with their encyclopedic knowledge of kit manufacturers and history. But sometimes you are surprised when you run into one. I once bought a couple of Authenticast slag car kits in a convention sales room, and when I let slip that I was looking forward to building them, the seller practically tried to grab them back from me. \u201cBuild them . . .\u201d he said in dismay. I got out of there as fast as I could (by the way, they still aren\u2019t built, as the smelter I once contemplated hasn\u2019t materialized). But really, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not a collector.\nHere\u2019s a photo of what these kits look like.\nBut when I say I\u2019m not a collector, what I mean is that I really intend (at the time) to build or use the stuff I buy, though I will concede that some of my purchases have been with the thought that someday I might need that item. And we have all learned in our years in the hobby that if in doubt, buy it. It will likely cease to be available, either out of production or the kit maker out of business or something else. Buy it now or regret it later, the saying goes. I have certainly followed that injunction in some cases.\nNaturally many of those purchases, made with the best of intentions, somehow slip out of contention for building or use, like my slag cars. And certainly freight car kits, of which I once had a truly serious stash, can pile up on you in the most unnerving fashion. The question is how you evaluate this. Maybe you are turning into a collector and haven\u2019t realized it yet. A clue is when you really like owning \u201cthat kit\u201d or \u201cthat brass engine\u201d but have no interest in building or painting it, and certainly no interest in selling it. Nothing wrong with that, though I do advocate facing up to the reality that is right under your nose.\nOr maybe you have just let things get out of hand. You know perfectly well that some of those kits were bought with objectives in mind that are no longer operative. I used to pick up structure kits all the time, when I lived in Pittsburgh and my layout had several sizable areas which were undefined, and thus could conceivably host any one of a number of structures. Now those areas are far distant in the rear-view mirror, and the kits, though still kind of nice, are clearly surplus. And there were plenty of freight car kits on my shelf which, when I looked at them objectively, really were not needed for my freight car fleet nor were sufficiently \u201cfun\u201d just to build. That makes \u2019em surplus.\nI have written in earlier posts about the gradual change in my freight car fleet, with the disposal of older models as well as unneeded kits (for example: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2014/12/a-right-size-freight-car-fleet.html ). The process continues. I never planned to replace the older models which were the best I could do at that time (remember when Athearn \u201cBlue Box\u201d box cars were the starting point for all 40-foot steel box cars?), but that\u2019s what has been happening over the last two decades. I have now disposed of close to 350 cars, in the form of kits and of older, complete models, and have acquired or built about 275 new cars, in kit or ready-to-run form. The net effect has been to reduce my stash of car kits substantially. Resin in particular has been addressed very thoroughly, with more than 125 resin car kits either built or sold.\nOne good effect of car kits of various kinds passing through my hands is that in many cases I have made a Xerox copy of kit instructions to keep, as the information can be pretty valuable in itself, not only the prototype data but model-building techniques. I even like to look at the instructions for kits owned for a long time, as a reminder of what I once wanted to do, and that can refresh some of my present planning. So even keeping your stuff moving can leave you with something of value.\nPractically every modeler has a stash of some kind, whether it\u2019s structure or car kits like I discussed above, or brass engines that you \u201cmight need,\u201d or materials like brick paper or basswood sheet or flat brass wire or . . . you recognize the pattern. This can be an asset when you need something out of that collection, but may need to be dealt with when it starts to overflow the storage space \u2014 or overflow what you are comfortable holding on to. It just needs to be evaluated from time to time.\nOver the years, I have accumulated a few older models that continue to serve as \u201cmainline\u201d freight cars, that is, cars which normally do not get switched to or from my on-layout industries, but simply pass by in the mainline freight trains (this was discussed in the last paragraph of this post: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2010/12/upgrading-old-models-3.html ). Some of these have older trucks I had never bothered to replace, and recently I got to looking at a few of them and decided they needed to be upgraded. If nothing else, this can be seen as a response in accord with my freight car standards (see for example: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/03/model-freight-car-standards.html ), but also reflects problems like oversize flanges, out-of-tram truck behavior, or other operational issues.\nAs an example, I will use a Mantua reefer. Minimal upgrading had been done to it, retaining its molded-on grab irons and sill steps, but with a reasonable paint and lettering job, as well as weathering. I have been working on some other \u201cmainline\u201d cars also needing new trucks, including some old tank car models and two Athearn metal house cars, but will just describe the Mantua example.\nShown above is the car body, prepared as described. Notice the route card, located right outside the black rectangle identified as the location for such cards. This card location is often seen in photos, no doubt deliberately done by car clerks who didn\u2019t wish to be dictated to. The car is intended to represent the MDT cars with steel ends and wood-sheathed sides built in 1941.\nThe problem with the trucks can be seen in the view below. The Mantua truck is assembled as two cast metal sideframes, with a sheet steel bolster inserted into each sideframe. The sharp \u201ccookie cutter\u201d wheel flanges are an artifact of the 1950s. You can click to enlarge.\nI first tried to disassemble the truck so the wheelsets could be replaced, but could not separate the parts. Also, I could see that the axle ends of the Mantua wheelsets are very narrow, so that the sideframes would not readily accept modern wheelsets. I decided to just replace the entire truck.\nThe original truck screws are very short and work only with the sheet-metal bolster shown above, so I simply tapped the hole deeper with a 2-56 tap, and chose new screws.\nOne can of course apply a generic AAR truck to cars like this. However, there are plentiful resources in existence to provide prototype information. In the case of MDT, the book Merchants Despatch, by Roger C. Hinman (Signature Press, 2011) is the relevant example, and I examined a number of photos in the book to choose a suitable truck for this model. I ended up using the Tahoe Model Works truck TMW-106, an ARA sideframe design with spring planks, produced by Buckeye.\nThe kind of job shown above on the Mantua reefer is almost trivial, except that it brings another car into conformance with standards, and also makes for better operation, when the oversize flanges of the Mantua wheelsets are replaced. In actuality, this kind of task goes on all the time with my fleet, and I only mention this instance here to use it as an example of the process.\nI\u2019ve just returned from a visit to Cuba on a licensed \u201cPeople to People\u201d tour, and there were plenty of interesting aspects to the trip, but here I will just write about the railroad and modeling aspects of interest.\nFirst, a little history. Cuba developed a rail network very early, plenty of it to serve sugar mills and plantations, but plenty more to connect cities. By 1958, Cuba had the most rail mileage per square mile of any country in the world. After the 1959 revolution, the existing railway companies were nationalized as Ferrocarriles Nationales de Cuba, which they remain today. An unfortunate aspect of a single national railway entity on an island is that there is no need to letter the name or even the initials of the owner on any equipment; there is no interchange. Rolling stock thus has a rather bare look, often bearing only a number and some very minor dimensional data.\nThe FC, as it\u2019s often designated, dieselized its main lines in the 1960s, and sugar operations gradually followed suit, eliminating steam on even the most backward plantations by about 2000. But many small steam locomotives have been preserved, and a few restored for tourism. Because of the U.S. embargo, new locomotives and rolling stock have been purchased elsewhere throughout the world, from the Soviet Union and China, to France, Germany, Britain and countries in eastern Europe, and in recent years, even freight cars from Iran. The resulting fleet is polyglot, to say the least.\nI will only show a few photos, and apologize in advance for not knowing more about the prototypes. I searched a number of Cuban bookstores for locomotive or train books, and found almost nothing. The internet coverage is spotty and sometimes contradictory. I hope anyone with a more substantial knowledge of the subject can help. But these are only intended as illustrations.\nIn Camaguey, the old railway station is terribly decrepit, though restoration is in progress, and a small replacement depot was very crowded. I was able to watch and photograph from trackside considerable switching activity, including adding cars to a departing passenger train, without attracting the least attention. Here is one of the Russian-built locomotives, no. 81001, I believe type TEM2, of which I saw several on our trip, in the red and yellow scheme which seems to be for freight power. These things sound a lot like Alcos.\nThe passenger power largely seemed to have an attractive scheme of dark and light blue. Passenger rolling stock ranged from stainless cars built by Budd, to very run-down standard steel coaches, to newer center-entrance cars looking much like box cars, and apparently built new that way. Note over the door the initials FC, not visible on many cars or locomotives.\nThe Chinese company, formerly called China North Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (CNR) sold a fair number of locomotives to Cuba, and if I correctly understood the halting English of a trainman standing alongside one of them at Camaguey, they are hard to keep running.\nIn a couple of places there were switchers in a pleasant orange and gray scheme, like no. 38063 here, but I have not been able to find out where they were built. It was picking up this head-end car.\nBut enough about rolling stock I didn\u2019t understand very well. The most stunning thing about Cuba, speaking as a modeler, is that walking in every city is like being in a 1950s movie. New American cars stopped arriving in Cuba in 1959, so there are 1950s American cars just everywhere. I knew they were there, but really had no idea how prevalent they are: they are not exceptions, they are the dominant car on the street. And even cars from the late 1930s and the 1940s can be seen too. I will only show a few of the many photos I took, and I can tell you, I plan to duplicate some of these models (though not the colors) on my 1953 layout.\nMany of the restored cars have been repainted in brilliant colors, and few have that many original mechanical parts. Suspensions are visibly altered, almost every car has modern wheels, and I was told that engines are rarely original (as was often evident from the sound). Many Russian and European parts have kept the cars running, and even homemade parts are used, attempting to replicate the unavailable American originals. There are lots of convertibles, partly because many of the cars are in use as privately-owned taxis, but there are also \u201cclassic car club\u201d stickers on many cars. Owners are usually very proud of their car, and most speak English and are delighted to speak to an American.\nI am interested in correct model years, partly for modeling reasons, but I found car-spotting in Cuba to be a challenge. Not only may such spotting features as chrome trim as well as tail lights and other items be missing or replaced, even major visuals like grilles may be swapped. I saw an early 1950s Chevrolet with an unmistakable Buick grille, and a 1940s Ford with a unique homemade grille. This makes one a little cautious about identification of an individual car. So I will just show a few of the photos I liked. The massed taxis at places like the Parque Centrale in Havana are one good illustration, of the variety, the frequency of convertibles, and the bright replacement colors.\nAnother street scene in Havana found my wife Mary alongside what I think is a 1951 Chevy sedan, clearly with replacement paint though otherwise looking more original than most. But like nearly every car, hub caps have vanished over the years.\nHere are a couple more that I really liked seeing, first a handsome 1955 Ford at a cafe on the road heading for Havana.\nLast, a superb Studebaker on the main square in Cienfuegos, I think a 1951. We also saw Edsels, International and Dodge pickups, and many more . . . but I digress.\nYou can see that it was a visually interesting trip, and of course fascinating in many other ways too, most enjoyable for us both.\nI have alluded in prior posts in the \u201cWaybills\u201d series to the extremely valuable publications issued by many (maybe most) railroads, called a Shipper\u2019s Guide, Industrial Directory, List of Industries, or some similar title. These documents list all on-line shippers and receivers, and are obviously superb resources. These are quite rare in the field of railroad paper items, in original form, and tend to be hard to find, even at railroad museums and archives, but luckily a number have been reprinted in recent years for modelers\u2019 use. I am using reprinted Shipper Guides from Ted Schnepf\u2019s \u201cRails Unlimited\u201d business, for Great Northern, D&RGW, Union Pacific, Mopac / T&P, and Milwaukee Road. All these except the D&RGW one are available through Rails Unlimited (and here\u2019s a link to their website: http://railsunlimited.ribbonrail.com/Books/shippers.html ; click on Books). There are several posts in which I have commented about these documents (for example, this one: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2012/02/waybills-18-resources.html ).\nInside are 258 pages packed with irreplaceable information about both shippers and consignees throughout the sprawling Rock Island system. I will just show a single page to illustrate the kind of information presented. You can click on the image to enlarge it.\nThe information is self-explanatory except for the far-right column, headed \u201cSWG\u201d (for \u201cswitching\u201d), which shows whether sidings are accessible by reciprocal switching arrangements (called \u201copen\u201d) or not (\u201cclosed\u201d). The five towns listed, each in a different state, are evidently small and have only a few industries each. By contrast, cities like Houston, Kansas City, Denver, or Minneapolis require dozens of pages to list all industrial customers.\nIn fact, this 1971 Rock Island Directory is so comprehensive, it now joins my Great Northern Guide (also from Rails Unlimited) as my favorite useful and wide-ranging source of traffic information.\nThere is another source of this kind of information about shippers and consignees, namely the large list compiled by the OpSIG group (Operations SIG of NMRA), which is available at their website, www.opsig.org, under \u201cOnline Resources,\u201d and then \u201cIndustry Database.\u201d This collected information is a fine effort by OpSIG and continues to grow, but be careful, as it is for a wide range of eras. Usually the date for each entry is shown, so it is possible to choose only the ones that fit your era. And though very extensive, it is in general less complete for a specific place than a Shipper Guide.\nIn place of the process just describe, one can of course \u201cimagineer\u201d company names for either consignees or shippers if desired, but I like to find authentic ones where possible, partly because the \u201creal names\u201d often sound particularly realistic, as in this case. I cannot praise enough the value of a Shipper Guide in assisting you in that process, should you wish to work in that direction.\nSeveral years ago, I posted some comments to this blog about how I manage the flow and storage of the rolling stock on my layout (you can read it at this link: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/12/operations-car-flow-and-car-storage.html ). I have a fair number of freight cars beyond what is needed to operate the layout, partly to create variety in operations, but certainly not least because I am a freight car enthusiast. I have always enjoyed researching and building new freight cars, and the result is a car fleet rather distinctly too large for the layout, even with extensive staging capacity.\nOne change I have made is to add some of the A-Line storage boxes. (These products are shown on their website, at: http://www.ppw-aline.com/hobbytote.htm ), though I have never bought the sleeve which makes them into a \u201ctote;\u201d I just buy the boxes.) These do a good job of holding about 16 cars each (for 40-foot cars), and they are well protected. Here is one such box, with the lid set aside.\nI continue to use my paper-carton boxes with trays (as described in the post linked at the top of this post), though because these are less quickly accessible than the A-Line boxes, they have become a kind of \u201cdeep storage\u201d option. Gradually the cars which are less frequently used are migrating into the paper-carton trays. Those cartons and trays were shown in the previous post, a link to which is at the top of this post.\nThe most active \u201cpool\u201d of cars is on the staging table, either made up into mainline trains, or simply in place on the storage tracks. This pool varies over time, with cars migrating off and onto the staging tracks as layout operations continue. Here is a shot of the table as it is at the moment.\nThe table is not quite fully extended, as the furthest track visible is the 11th (there are 12 in all).\nThe other part of the active \u201cpool\u201d storage is the shelving in my adjoining room (the kitchen, when this space was a sub-size apartment). These cars supplement the cars on the staging table. The top and bottom shelves are not really curved, the lens focal length just makes them look that way.\nHow is this managed? I have a chart laying out the sequence(s) of car movements at each industry or other car spot (this procedure, a version of what can be called \u201cdemand-based car flow,\u201d was described previously: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2011/11/operations-demand-based-car-flow-2.html ). From that chart, I make up a list of the movements which are the next sequence of operation, and go to my \u201cpairs list,\u201d described in an earlier post ( at: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2012/02/waybills-17-pairs-list.html ), and thereby find the cars with waybills for each of those car spots, along with the overlay bills for each spot. The waybills are filed by industry, so are readily retrieved. Then the car itself is located in storage by a (searchable) roster of all cars in active service. One of the entries for each car is its location, in a paper carton, in an A-Line box, or in the pool. I summarized an earlier version of this process in a blog post a few months ago (see it at: http://modelingthesp.blogspot.com/2015/07/waybills-part-42-flexibility.html ).\nObviously the car roster is a critical part of this process, and I have learned that the roster has to be kept up to date as cars move around between various storage locations. I usually indicate such movements with pencil corrections on the most recent print-out. When a page gets too heavily marked up, I just update the electronic file and reprint the page.\nAll in all, the process described above does work, and seems to provide good operational movement of cars, while permitting some selection of cars for each movement (because there are multiple waybills for every industry and car spot). I am always experimenting with ways to make the process more efficient, but for now, what I\u2019m describing works well.",

I started North to South to document our experiences traveling near and far to the places we\u2019ve always dreamed of visiting, and to share those experiences freely with the world \u2013 family, friends, and curious strangers alike.\nI hope you\u2019ll find something of value to you here on North to South. Have a question about a destination we\u2019ve been to? Want to know more about my decision to quit my job to travel the world? I\u2019m an open book, and I\u2019d love to hear from you. Don\u2019t hesitate to contact me. You can also find me on Facebook and Instagram.\nHere are some random fun facts about me.\nI love adventures, so I\u2019ll try almost anything once.\nI eat vegetarian with the exception of must-try local foods.\nI went to college in sunny, laid-back Malibu.\nI can speak and understand Spanish pretty well.\nI have a dog named Tiger, a playful guy with a big ol\u2019 heart and tiger stripes. My parents were kind enough to give him a home when I started traveling so I still get to hang out with him once in awhile.\nI prefer riding my bike over driving my car. We sold both when we started traveling, but after purchasing our Chicago condo, we both got some vintage road bikes again!\nI don\u2019t watch much TV, but I love Netflix.\nMy favorite foods are orange bell peppers and cheesecake.\nI absolutely hate the cold, but we picked Norway as our first destination.\nI\u2019ve got a fantastic travel companion in my boyfriend fianc\u00e9 husband Ian who shares my passion for travel and trying new things.\nI hate loud noises, but I blast music in the car at nearly full volume.\nMy first time out of the U.S. was on a trip to Spain with my high school Spanish class. I was 17.\nI get antsy being in one place for too long.\nBelow are a few of the common questions posed to us about our exciting journey transitioning from traditional American lives to full time travelers.\nWHAT INSPIRED US TO START TRAVELING?\nAfter each of us struggled to find joy in traditional American full-time jobs, we decided to call it quits and get out and explore the world.\nIn early 2014, the risk of wasting our time and missing out on new experiences finally won us over. It outweighed the risks involved in taking a non-traditional leap out of the regular working world and into the world of travel and entrepreneurship. There were a lot of unanswered questions, but we were confident we\u2019d figure it out.\nWe picked a goal date (March 1, 2014), outlined a plan for our transition, and decided that if we stayed on track and pooled up some extra savings, we\u2019d make the decision official at the beginning of February. After the first week of February, we\u2019d already booked flights and a place to stay for our first month overseas.\nOn March 2, 2014 (our two-year anniversary) we set out on our first adventure destination: the Norwegian fjords around Stord, Norway.\nRead more about our transition from average working Americans to full time travelers (with tips on how you can do it) here: Quit Your Job and Travel The World.\nHOW DO WE PLAN TO GET BY?\nWith our creative entrepreneurship skills, of course!\nYes, we\u2019ve got money in savings, but it\u2019s for emergencies only. A sustainable travel lifestyle is key to our success, so we plan to focus our energy on entrepreneurial endeavors that can be managed from anywhere (as long as there\u2019s Internet access somewhere nearby). Check out LonelySpeck.com \u2013 currently our biggest ongoing online project, focused on sharing astrophotography knowledge and skills with others. While you\u2019re at it, take a peek at StylishTravelGirl.com, my new site for fashionable traveling women, and PhotonCollective.com, our latest photography web project.\nWHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF YOUR STUFF?\nSurprisingly, I think this is actually the question I was asked most frequently when we were preparing to leave on our first trip. Everyone was so concerned with what would become of our things! Well, we donated most items, sold a few things, and stored even fewer in a closet at my parents\u2019 house. Aside from the stuff we packed for our first trip, we actually kept very little.\nSend me your question, and I\u2019ll respond as quickly as our traveling lifestyle and Internet access allows!",

    "text": "Almost all metals in the universe were produced in stars through nuclear fusion. As stars died, they released these metals into their surrounding environment. These heavy elements were then incorporated into later generations of stars, which eventually exploded as supernovae and released more metals into their surroundings, and so on.\nBut can we get even more specific? Instead of just considering how metallicities change as a function of radius, can we start to consider how metallicities change around the disk of a galaxy?\nSatellite Galaxies All in a Row\u2014How So?\nHyper-velocity stars (HVS) are so named because they speed through our galaxy really, really fast. So fast, in fact, that they can escape the gravitational pull of our galaxy (about 300 km/s for the Milky Way). This means that either they are flying in from somewhere else altogether, maybe a dwarf galaxy that collided with us, or they were accelerated to such high velocities by a dramatic event within our own galaxy. There are two widely accepted theories about what this event could be, and HVS stars are often divided into two categories based on which origin story they fit best. One theory proposes that when a binary star system gets too close to the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way it is ripped apart by the strong gravitational forces, leaving one star in a close orbit around the black hole and ejecting the other. However, some HVS have been seen travelling from other parts of the galaxy. These can also be explained with binary star systems, but in this case it is the force of the supernova explosion of one star that ejects its companion and accelerates it to high speeds.\nWhat\u2019s the first question that comes to mind when someone tells you they have discovered an exoplanet? Very likely, you want to know if it looks anything like the Earth. To actually answer that question, we need to not only find exoplanets but also characterize them, figuring out properties like the size of the planet, whether it has liquid water, and its atmospheric composition.\nDespite being such temperamental objects, variable stars can be reliable tools for probing the universe. By measuring the period of a variable star, we can learn about its composition, age, and brightness, broadly speaking. Applying that knowledge to large populations of variable stars can tell us about the structure of the Milky Way and our nearby Universe (shoutout to Henrietta Swan Leavitt and the Cepheid period-luminosity relation) as well as stellar evolution.\nThe authors of today\u2019s paper used the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution catalogue (aka TGAS) which provides very high-accuracy velocity data for potential lens stars, and cross matched it with all of the stars in the Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) source catalog to find any microlensing events that would happen within Gaia\u2019s remaining lifetime. After combing through over 13,000 candidate lens stars, the authors were able to find one promising microlensing event for Gaia to detect! It turns out that we\u2019re in for a treat on November 11th, 2019: LAWD 37, one of the closest known WDs to the Sun at only 4.6 parsecs away, will pass within a fraction of an arcsecond of a background star (with the somewhat less catchy name: Gaia Source 5332606346467258496), as shown in figure 3.\nIf only our eyes were sensitive enough, the night sky would be ablaze with nearby astronomical structures. The Andromeda Galaxy would stretch across the sky about six times the angular width of the full Moon. The Magellanic Clouds would be fireballs tens of Moons across. The reddened molecular filaments of the nearby star-forming region Taurus-Auriga, glittering with young stars, would stretch over an area about 30 Moons across.\nVarious studies throughout the years have established the fact that the gas giants significantly influenced the formation and evolution of our solar system. Jupiter in particular is thought to have played a considerable role in shaping the formation of the inner solar system. Astronomers believe that during the formation of the solar system, Jupiter blocked material from flowing into the inner disk, altered the velocity distribution of this material, and disrupted planet formation within several AU of the sun, leaving our solar system with no planets out to 0.39 AU. Because the gas giants played such an integral role in the formation of our own solar system, scientists are now interested in whether similar processes occur in exoplanetary systems.\nDuring a recent visit to the Dutch National Maritime Museum I came across the world map from 1648 AD by cartographer Joan Blaeu. In addition to being the first world map of the Earth that adhered to the Copernican worldview, Blaeu\u2019s map is an extremely detailed document of the knowledge of the world at the time sourced solely from the information gathered by explorers from their travels through ages to the far reaches of the world. It\u2019s inaccuracies and subjectivity to the western view of the world are quite amusing, but there is still a level of high detail and surprising accuracy. Through these details, it is clear that cartographers must meticulously piece together information from a large number of sources of varying reliability. Creating maps of exoplanets, also beginning to be known as Exocartography, is an equally challenging observational and mathematical problem which is addressed by today\u2019s paper.\nCreating maps of exoplanets can give an idea of the presence of climatic features in the planetary atmosphere or surface which when compared to predictions from general circulations models can give us an insight into physical processes in play in their atmospheres. Observations in this context comprise of continuous monitoring of the brightness of a planetary system as different regions of the planet come into view. A schematic of these occultations is shown in Figure 1. Disk integrated flux (total flux from the planet\u2019s surface which is visible as a circular disk) of the planet observed as a function of time in this way can then be converted to flux (more easily so for a tidally locked planet) as a function of spatial locations on the planet (which are coming into view as a function of time) to render a 2D brightness map of the planet for the chosen wavelength band.\nSince the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015, there\u2019s been a large focus on the gravitational waves produced by binary systems due to their loudness and characteristic signature. Most of this attention has focused on binary systems composed of compact objects like black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs as these are naturally the loudest events, the only binaries we know to exist in the frequency bands of ground-based interferometers\u2026and compact objects are really cool. However, the coming space-based interferometer LISA will open up an entirely new frequency band for gravitational wave detection, and with it new progenitor systems to probe. Previous Astrobites have focused on some of these systems, such as supermassive black hole binaries, neutron star-white dwarf binaries, and even galactic binaries like AM Canum Venaticorum-type systems. However all these systems are still composed of compact and stellar, or larger, sized objects. Today\u2019s paper takes a close look at a very different kind of binary system, an ultra-short period exoplanet, and shows that some of them should produce detectable gravitational wave signatures.\nThousands of exoplanets have been discovered to date, the vast majority within the past twenty years. In comparison with more massive and compact systems composed of black holes and neutron stars, the intrinsic gravitational wave luminosity of exoplanet systems is quite weak, but for select systems that are close to Earth their proximity can make up for the relatively weak signal and can be loud enough to be detected above the gravitational wave background. In order for such exoplanet systems to be detectable in the frequency range of space-based interferometers they must have extremely short periods of order an hour or less, and to be loud enough the planet has to be quite large.\nSeeing Red (and Blue): Two Sub-Populations of Type Ia Supernovae?\nType Ia supernovae are useful because we can use them as standardizable candles\u2014objects whose inherent luminosity we can figure out based on various properties such as how long it takes for them to fade after brightening. Once we know their luminosity (how much light they actually emit) we can calculate their distance based on measuring their brightness (how much light we measure from them here on Earth) and applying the inverse-square law. Actually figuring out their luminosity requires some care, however. We think that Type Ia supernovae can happen in at least two different ways (see this bite from 2012 for an explanation), and astronomers using them for distance measurements need to make various empirical corrections in order to do so.\nIn the last 2000 years, only 8 supernovae have occurred within our galaxy that were bright enough to be recorded by humans. Among these is SN 1572, which was seen in the year 1572. It was observed around the world, but is perhaps most famously associated with the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, who wrote a small book about it titled De Nova Stella. As an aside, the title of that book is where the modern-day terms \u2018nova\u2019 and hence \u2018supernova\u2019 come from. The appearance of a new star in the sky helped to challenge the old Aristotelian understanding that the heavens were unchanging. Even today, there is a lot that we can learn from this supernova.\nAt the site where SN 1572 occurred, we see today a supernova remnant \u2014 a cloud of gas that was thrown off by the supernova (see Figure 1). In fact, the gas shell is still visibly expanding, as you can see in this video. By studying light emitted by the supernova and reflected from surrounding material, researchers in 2008 were able to tell that SN 1572 was a type Ia supernova. Supernovae of this type are used to measure the distances to far-away galaxies, because of their unique feature that each explosion has almost the same luminosity. We know that Type Ia supernovae are caused by exploding white dwarfs, but we don\u2019t fully understand what triggers the explosion. There are two important models: either the white dwarf collides with another white dwarf, or it grows in mass by pulling in material from a companion star.\nIn the second of those two models, the companion star should survive the explosion and be flung away at a relatively high speed. Apart from having a high velocity, it would look just like a normal star near the supernova remnant. Therefore, by looking for a star near the supernova remnant that might be a surviving companion, researchers can hope to tell which of the two models triggered the explosion in SN 1572.\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen Star Wars (the original saga), you probably remember that scene in A New Hope with the two suns. You know, Luke Skywalker is whining about being stuck on his home planet Tatooine and stomps off into the binary sunset. Two suns hover over the horizon in a way that we Earthlings never witness in our single star system.\nWell, this scene in the science fiction masterpiece is not so far off from reality. Planets have been found to exist around binary star systems. Whether or not there are droids and Jedi on those planets is a different story.\nToday\u2019s paper examines the phenomenon of extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) in a galactic open cluster \u2013 NGC 2818A. To do this, the authors make use of Gaia DR2, the data gift that keeps on giving, along with archival VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy.\nOur first detection of gravitational waves with LIGO changed everything for astronomy. For the first time, we are able to not just look out into the Universe, but \u201clisten\u201d to it as well. So far, we\u2019ve heard the collisions of the remnants of massive stars: black holes and neutron stars. The resulting data has had massive implications in fields from general relativity to nucleosynthesis. Today\u2019s paper proposes a new use for detections of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Vitale & Farr (2018) make the argument that if we know how often black holes are colliding, we should be able to determine how often stars form to produce these black holes.",

    "text": "September 27, 2018 \u2014 There\u2019s no denying electrical safety in the workplace is critically important\u2014not just for electrical contractors themselves, but also for the operators of electrical equipment and for business productivity.\nProperly maintaining electrical equipment plays a key role in creating a safe workplace. Yet a number of Canadian companies don\u2019t have an electrical equipment maintenance program or understand its importance.\nIn fact, it was only in 2013, when CSA Z463, Guideline on Maintenance of Electrical Systems, was introduced, that Canada finally had a document on electrical maintenance, explains Kerry Heid, chair of the Z463 Technical Committee.\nAnd even then, Z463 was only introduced as a guideline, which is more of a \u201crecommended practice,\u201d Heid says. This will now change with the release of CSA Z463, Standard on Maintenance of Electrical Systems, in September.\nWhat is Z463? Put simply, it is a standard that requires companies to create an electrical equipment maintenance program, explains Terry Becker, a member of the Z463 Technical Committee.\nThe standard recommends a number of such strategies, he adds, including predictive, preventive, run-to-fail, reliability-centred and risk-based.\nAs a standard on electrical maintenance, Z463\u2019s scope is very broad, covering equipment for power generation, transmission and distribution, transformers, cables, switchgear and much more.\nAnnex M of Z463, explains Becker, provides a set of tables that identify these types of electrical equipment, provide guidance for recommended electrical tests and, based on the level of importance of service, the frequency at which these tests should be performed on the equipment.\nHowever, Heid points out, it does not cover overhead lines or residential electrical equipment.\nZ463\u2019s ultimate priority, Becker argues, is safety. Following this standard will ensure reliability of service and manage damage through protective devices, he explains.\nIf electrical equipment is not maintained properly, on the other hand, then there is the risk of failure.\n\u201cWhen qualified electrical professionals have to work on it, we want to minimize their exposure to arc flash and shock hazards,\u201d he says.\nPredictive maintenance is one possible strategy for reducing these types of exposure.\nIn fact, Heid points out, Z463 lists 10 different online maintenance diagnostic tests, including visual inspections, corona imaging, acoustics, ultrasound and vibration analysis.\nBut not all of these tests are mandatory.\nGiven this focus, there is clearly a strong relationship between Z463 and CSA Z462, Standard on Workplace Electrical Safety.\nZ462 also defines normal operating conditions of energized electrical equipment, Becker adds.\nWhen an arcing fault is accidentally created, then \u201cthe power circuit breaker with protected relay functions as predicted, so we limit the incident energy, i.e. the heat released from an arc flash,\u201d Becker explains.\nWith the release of Z463 as a standard, Becker says there is now a \u201csafety trifecta\u201d in Canada.\n\u201cThe Canadian Electrical (CE) Code Part 1 covers safe installations, CSA Z462 covers safe workplaces and then Z463 helps bring those two together,\u201d he explains.\nThis is an important change, he says, because the CE Code mandates the safe installation of electrical equipment, but does not include maintenance requirements, while Z462 recognizes the need for safe workplace practices when working on and operating energized electrical equipment.\nAs a result, you\u2019ll have better reliability and more uptime.\nCompany managers may be wondering about additional impacts of Z463 on their business, such as costs and training. Fred Tanguay, a consultant for Canada Training Group, is answering this call by teaching them how to integrate and implement Z463 into their maintenance programs. In his opinion, the standard will help drive the requirement for proper maintenance home.\nHe acknowledges many companies might be averse to Z463 because of the cost.\nConsequently, he says it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely paramount\u201d for companies to maintain their electrical systems properly. If the equipment malfunctions or breaks, \u201cthe repair cost is usually 50 times the replacement cost,\u201d since companies have to pay for overtime, temporary power supplies, and account for production loss.\nIt\u2019s not just the employees who operate and maintain the equipment that need to understand Z463, Tanguay explains. But he often sees only these workers attending his classes.\nIn applying this standard, Becker says, companies will turn to electrical contractors. Indeed, contractors who market electrical equipment maintenance to their clients can use Z463 to help them develop maintenance strategies, tests and test frequencies.\nHeid agrees Z463 will be extremely beneficial in helping electrical contractors convince their clients of the importance of well-maintained systems and equipment.\nDespite the benefits and value of Z463, Becker points out, it has not been widely adopted.\nCSA will promote Z463 as a standard on its website, through its social media channels and at conferences. The Technical Committee will promote it, as well.\nThis article originally appeared in the September 2018 issue of Electrical Business.",

\ufffdAmazing!! \ufffdWonderful sleeping weather. \ufffdThe days have only gotten into the mid 70\u2019s. \ufffdI love it. \ufffdFor my part, the Good Lord could just let it be this way all summer and I would be happy.\nThe girls had lots of fun. \ufffdThey came in the house and got their wading shoes and spent lots of time wading in the pond. \ufffdJasper even joined them for a while. \ufffdHe doesn\u2019t care much for water. \ufffdI suppose after his accident the first winter, he thinks water isn\u2019t much fun.\nLots of cool bugs were flying around the pond.\nI have no idea what they are but if you look closely you can see the tiny blue bugs that were hovering around the blade of grass.\nWe have so many of these birds. \ufffdI couldn\u2019t tell for sure from the picture if they were barn swallows or tree swallows. \ufffdBoth birds are abundant here. \ufffdThey will fly down to the pond and touch the water. \ufffdIt is amazing to watch. \ufffdSometimes as many as 50 or more just skipping above the water. \ufffdI\u2019m not sure if they are getting a drink or catching bugs but it is one of our favorite evening passtimes to watch them.\nI thought I would share with you all a picture of the lower garden.\ufffd It is doing pretty good.\ufffd The upper garden is having a little more of a difficult time.\ufffd We are having trouble keeping the calves out of it.\ufffd They seem to find new ways to get out every day and seem to enjoy the corn in the upper garden very much.\ufffd Shadow is getting too old to chase them and Jasper is just learning.\ufffd He is on the accelerated learning program right now as I want him to learn quickly.\ufffd He actually is getting much better.\ufffd He \u201csometimes\u201d listens and obeys commands.\ufffd Sometimes he is just so happy that the calves are running from him, he doesn\u2019t care where they are running.\ufffd Oh well, that\u2019s life on a farm.\nI just love to see a sunrise or a sunset.\ufffd I think it comes from living in the mountains of southwest virginia.\ufffd Where I grew up, you never saw either one.\ufffdOur house was in what we call a \u201choller\u201d so\ufffdthe view was blocked by the mountains.\ufffd The sun would hit our yard about 11:00 and go down about 3:00.\ufffd I guess thats one of the reasons I love living here in Floyd.\ufffd In the summer, the sun is in our yard about 6:30 and leaves about\ufffd8:00.\ufffd Lots of sunshine, which I love.\ufffd This morning God put on another show for us to enjoy.\ufffd Thank you Lord!\ufffd School today as usual.\ufffd It is hard to concentrate on school now though.\ufffd We feel like we\u2019re been let out of prison.\ufffd The temperatue is warm, the snow is almost gone, so of course everyone wants to be outside instead of in.\ufffd We try to mix a little of both so it doesn\u2019t get to bad.\ufffd Jasper (young dog) had his first experience with a skunk last night.\ufffd Not very pleasant.\ufffd I tried a remedy one of the ladies from church told me about.\ufffd I sprayed him with Febreeze.\ufffd It actually helped quite a lot.\ufffd He still smells but not as bad.\ufffdI don\u2019t have to cook tonight,\ufffdwe are eating\ufffd at church.\ufffd Roast beef and potatoes with all the trimmings.\ufffd It has been a long time since we went to church on Wednesday night.\ufffd When the weather is bad, they call it off.\ufffd\ufffd I am definitely looking forward to going tonight.\ufffd The girls are involved in TeamKids there at church.\ufffd They alternate Wednesdays doing childrens choir and handbells.\ufffd They really enjoy the handbells.\ufffd The adults are doing a Beth Moore study on the fruit of the spirit.\ufffd It has been a really good study so far, however we are pretty far behind because of the bad weather we\u2019ve had this winter.\ufffd\ufffd They have decided not to watch the video that goes with it, in order to hopefully get it finished in May.\ufffd Guess I better get ready to go.\ufffd Take care and God bless.\nI used to be so strong.\ufffd Oh well, it\u2019s not too bad.\ufffd The girls really enjoy them being in.\ufffd Cold here today.\ufffd The wind is blowing pretty hard.\ufffd The fire went out last night and when I tried to build a new fire this morning, the smoke was terrible.\ufffd I eventually just took the wood out of the stove and left it alone.\ufffd I would rather be a little cool than have to deal with all that smoke.\ufffd We have the gas logs on so its not too cold.\ufffd Hopefully, we will do bible study tomorrow.\ufffd I am very excited\ufffdto begin this study.\ufffd\ufffdEsther is such an exciting book to study and\ufffdI\u2019m sure Beth Moore will bring out things I would never think about.\ufffd We are hopefully\ufffdgoing down to Jessica\u2019s\ufffdthis weekend.\ufffd\ufffdI\ufffdwant to do some girl stuff.\ufffd\ufffdThe town she lives in has an excellent Goodwill Store.\ufffd\ufffdI love shopping at Goodwill!\ufffd I\ufffdguess I just love thrift store shopping in general, yard sales, consignment sales, etc.\ufffd Good deals at good prices.\ufffd Well, lunch break is over.\ufffd Time for school.\ufffd Enjoy your day and God bless.\nI took these pictures this afternoon after church.\ufffd This road connects to our road.\ufffd About 3 weeks ago when the first drifts came, they cleared this road.\ufffd I was told it took 12 hours to clear it.\ufffd I can only imagine how tall the snow was then, if it still looks like this 3 weeks later.\ufffd Church today was very good, communion with a fellowship meal, then a business meeting.\ufffd I went alone as Julie is still sick. \ufffd Hubby volunteered to stay home with them.\ufffd I very seldom go anywhere alone, so it felt very strange.\ufffd Julie is feeling some better though so I pray she is on the mend.\ufffd\ufffd The young pup Jasper seems to be on the mend too.\ufffd Take care and God bless.\nI thought everyone would enjoy some more snow pictures.\ufffd The last picture is the pond.\ufffd\ufffdI\ufffdknow it just looks\ufffdwhite but it really is snowing hard.\ufffd Yes, it is snowing again.\ufffd 2-4 inches.\ufffd Well, that don\u2019t sound too bad.\ufffd We did get out over the weekend.\ufffd Went to town Saturday and church yesterday.\ufffd It felt good to get out.\ufffd Not much else happening here today.\ufffd Just school and everyday things.\ufffd We brought Jasper (the puppy-I shouldn\u2019t call him puppy anymore) in and gave him a bath this morning.\ufffd Very interesting!\ufffd He hadn\u2019t had a bath in a while as he has been outside most of the winter.\ufffd \ufffdI was amazed at how much bigger he is.\ufffd I have allowed him to stay in today while he is drying.\ufffd He is a very happy dog, and of course Julie is a very happy girl.\ufffd Enjoy your day and God bless.",

    "text": "Bazouti S, Omahsan L, Chahib H, Sakhsoukh R, Dikhaye S, Zizi N. Rosacea infant: not always a benign dermatosis. Our Dermatol Online. 2018;9(4):410-411.\nRosacea is a condition that is most often associated with adults; however, various forms exist in the pediatric population and must be taken into account when a child presents a rash to the face. We report a rare case of rosacea with severe ocular involvement in a 7-year-old child with discrete papules and pustules on both cheeks and chin with blepharitis and decreased visual acuity. The ophthalmologic examination confirmed a severe blepharitis with severe mibomitis associated with a stromal corneal ulcer. The diagnosis of rosacea with ocular involvement was made. Patient was put on oral azithromycin, topical metronidazole at the face and a photoprotection with good evolution. Early recognition and treatment of ocular rosacea in children can improve patient outcomes by limiting the progression of corneal pathology.\nRosacea is a chronic inflammatory facial dermatitis. It mainly affects persons of middle age and a clear phototype, and it is considered rare in children . Ocular involvement is the most serious complication requiring early diagnosis in order to preserve the visual function. We report a new case of ocular rosacea in a 7-year-old child.\nA 7-year-old boy with a phototype III, and a family history of rosacea affecting his mother and maternal aunts, consulted the ophthalmic emergencies for a painful red right eye with significant photophobia. In the anamnesis, we find notion of flushes during temperature changes and repeated chalazion with a many similar episodes during the last two years wrongly treated as allergic conjunctivitis. Ophthalmological examination showed blepharitis with severe meibomitis associated with a stromal corneal ulcer (Fig. 1). A dermatological examination had objectified the presence of some erythematous papules, telangiectasias on a pink background of cheeks, chin and the palp\u00e9bral edges (Fig. 2). The dermoscopic examination had shown the presence of arborizing vessels, sometimes polygonal, as well as pustules and erythematous background. The diagnosis of rosacea was retained and the patient was put on oral azitromycin, topical metronidazole in the face and photoprotection with a good evolution.\nFigure 1: Clinical image showing a corneal ulcer.\nFigure 2: Papulopustular lesions associated with telangiectasia.\nRosacea is a fairly common chronic facial dermatitis, whose infantile forms are rare and often underdiagnosed. The cutaneous manifestations described in children, generally inconspicuous, seem identical to those observed in adults [2\u20133], with the exception of hypertrophic rosacea never reported in this age group . Familial history of rosacea is often reported  as in our case which could support the diagnosis. Ocular signs, however, are not specific and can reach all levels of severity ranging from simple photophobia to blepharitis-meibomitis to blindness through a keratoconjunctivitis complicated sometimes by corneal ulcers  as was the case in our patient, imposing immediate care. There is no correlation between the severity of ocular rosacea and inflammatory cutaneous rosacea . Although rosacea in children especially before puberty, is uncommon, ocular symptoms are often present at diagnosis .\nThe local treatment is identical to that of adult rosacea . A systemic treatment is proposed in case of failure of topics or in case of severe ocular involvement. Systemic antibiotics, primarily the tetracyclines, are the drugs of choice for most individuals with rosacea. Tetracyclines should not be used in children younger than 8 years, because they can lead to discoloration of teeth and susceptibility to fracture by incorporation into bones and teeth. In this younger age group, macrolides are the preferred agents. Azithromycin can produce marked improvement, even when administered for only 5 days .\nInfantile rosacea is a rare and potentially serious disease in its ocular form. Its presentation is not specific and can be confusing, especially in the absence of dermatological lesions. In front of a child with ocular signs suspicious of rosacea, the dermatological examination is an important step for making the diagnosis. Early management avoids serious complications such as keratitis and/or corneal ulcer. Only a multidisciplinary and effective management by dermatologist and ophthalmologist avoids the complications that can lead to blindness.\n1. Kroshinsky & Glick. Pediatric rosacea.

    "text": "Parents need to know that although the bestselling Hunger Games books are enormously popular with tweens, there's a clear distinction between reading about violence and seeing it portrayed on screen. Developmentally, the 10- to 12-year-olds who've read the book may find the movie's visceral, sometimes bloody teen-on-teen violence upsetting -- especially the brutal scene that opens the Games, in which several teens are slaughtered by their fellow contestants. Even young teens need to be mature enough to deal with the 20+ deaths in The Hunger Games; characters are viciously dispatched with various weapons -- including spears, arrows, and swords -- as well as by having their necks broken, their skulls cracked, and their bodies ravaged by carnivorous and poisonous creatures. Despite the violence (which is, overall, less graphic than the novel's descriptions but is still very intense), the movie explores thought-provoking themes about reality television, totalitarian government, and screen violence as entertainment. And Katniss, the main character, is a strong heroine who's resourceful, selfless, and a true survivor. Her mentor, Haymitch, is initially depicted as a cynical drunk, but he ultimately proves to be a valuable ally.\nPeeta reveals that he's had a crush on Katniss since they were kids, and the two kiss a couple of times, one time pretty passionately.\nAs in the book, The Hunger Games' central \"pageant\" is a televised battle to the death: 24 children between the ages of 12 and 18 (12 girls, 12 boys) are selected to participate in a bloody reality show-style contest in which there's only one victor. There's a pervasive sense of peril and tension, and once the Games start, there's an immediate bloodbath, with vicious weapon use, a fair amount of blood, and several dead bodies -- though the quick editing means that the most gruesome bits aren't lingered on. The young combatants proceed to die from spears, arrows, knives, deadly insect bites, attack by genetically modified dog-like creatures, and poisonous berries (some deaths occur off camera). A couple of the tributes also have their necks snapped or heads bashed. The Gamemakers purposely devise situations to try and kill off characters, including a scary fire with fireball projectiles; another scene has a large explosion. Katniss is badly burned; Peeta has a nasty knife injury. Earlier in the movie, there are scenes of characters practicing with weapons and demonstrating their deadly skills, as well as gory snippets of footage from earlier Games. Scenes of a riot and subsequent retaliation by government forces.\nVery infrequent use of words like \"damn,\" \"hell,\" and \"oh my God\" (as an exclamation).\nThought-provoking, complex messages. Teamwork and loyalty are valued, but deception and artifice are also rewarded. The will to survive, the fragile relationship between a dictatorial government and its oppressed people, rebellion as a preferred option to obedience, and the distinction between image and reality are all addressed. There are many discussion-worthy themes in the movie, and they touch on everything from the micro/personal to the macro/political.\nNo product placements in the film, but the viral marketing and merchandise tie-ins for the movie (and books) include a line of themed nail polish, as well as apparel, jewelry, games, and more.\nHaymitch is often drunk; he has a drink in his hand for the first half of the movie -- though as he gains focus/motivation, he drinks less. Several dinner and party scenes show adults and teenagers drinking various brightly colored beverages/cocktails.",

    "text": "If you are prepared to throw yourself into the Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine world, it has one of the best affiliate programs on the market. I will be talking about that too later on.\nIn case you\u2019ve never created a sales funnel before then Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine has you covered.\nWhile Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine gives you a wonderful starting point with its funnel and page templates, the Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine editor is the place you can truly make each page in your funnel your own.\nElements (or widgets) are all vital for providing you the flexibility to design the specific pages you woud like and Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine gives you a large variety of them to use.\nThe Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine affiliate program pays out 40% recurring commissions for each referral you make and you can win cool prizes like $500 towards your own dream car as soon as you hit 100 active referrals.\nKartra 4 Day Cash Machine also has another excellent feature for affiliates called share funnels.\nKartra 4 Day Cash Machine limits you to 20 funnels, 100 pages, and 20,000 visitors on their cheapest plan. I\u2019m really not a fan of software products that limit you in this way.\nThat is why Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine put so much work into the onboarding process to help ease you into the software. The Kartra interface is fairely well designed for the most part and when you\u2019ve assembled a couple funnels yourself, the entire process does get easier over time.\nKartra 4 Day Cash Machine support is fairly good in my experience, although they can be a little slow in responding. They use Intercom, so you may immediately ask questions in the live chat box. Support requests are usually answered in a couple of hours and I found the staff to pretty helpful to all my questions.\nEven though Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine has its own email service provider via Actionetics, it also integrates directly with all the best email marketing software on the market.\nI believe Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine gets some negative buzz around it due to all of the affiliates who are making an effort to market it.\nThere are a few Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine alternatives out there which share a number of the same capabilities as Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine. Two that I use myself are LeadPages and SamCart.\nHowever, if you are selling a service or product, then Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine is the better choice. While it comes with a higher learning curve than Leadpages, once you master the tool, you can really explode your sales as soon as you begin creating sales funnels for each of your products.\nSamCart is a product that lets users build amazing, high converting checkout pages. Which gives it a lot in common with Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine.\nSamCart does permit you to add order bumps, upsells and downsells such as Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine does. You can also quickly create coupons for your products which is just another terrific way to increase conversions.\nHowever, where Samcart is missing, is the capability to capture leads and build complete sales funnels. The products come in at the same $97 a month price point, and I find Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine to be quite a bit more flexible and powerful than Samcart.\nOtherwise, Kartra 4 Day Cash Machine could be overkill for you. You can collect leads or sell your front end product more cheaply using alternative services.",

    "text": "Customers line up to purchase lottery tickets, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, at La Preferida Superdiscount store in Hialeah, Fla.\nFor all the anticipation about whether someone will finally snag the gigantic Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots, the games come down to two things: simple math \u2014 and very long odds.\nThe dismal odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 1 in 302.5 million \u2014 mean there are 302.5 million potential number combinations, or a little less than one combination for each of the 328 million people living in the U.S. For last Friday's drawing, about 59 per cent of possible combinations were taken. But by Tuesday night's drawing, officials estimate that 75 per cent will be sold.\nThat would mean a 25 per cent chance of no winner. If that happens, it's likely even more combinations would be covered before the next drawing three days later. Officials don't have an estimate on how many tickets would be sold for that potential drawing, and they haven't said how large the estimated prize would be. Could it reach $2 billion?\nIf the odds of winning either Mega Millions or Powerball don't seem gigantic enough, how about winning them both? Spend $4 on a ticket for each game and it could happen. But the odds aren't especially favourable, at about 1 in 88 quadrillion (that's 88,000,000,000,000,000).\nFor Mega Millions, players choose six numbers: five from a range of white balls, numbered 1 to 70, and one number for the Mega Ball, with a range of 1 to 25. What numbers have come up most? Since 2010, that honour goes to the number 2, with 92 hits, followed by the numbers 20, 11, 31 and 17. The most hit Mega Ball number is 9.",

    "text": "If a career as a Bus or Coach (PCV) driver appeals to you, you might want to consider getting a licence first. A PCV licence is a necessary requirement in UK for anyone who is driving or wanted to drive a Passenger Carrying Vehicle. Acquiring a PCV Licence would not only increase your chances in securing a job as a Coach or Bus driver, you would also get the chance to enjoy the benefits once you are employed.\nA passenger carrying vehicle licence can be attained through a fairly simple process. Of course like any licence it requires levels of examinations but it\u2019s nothing more than examinations you will have done for your car driving license. There are basically 5 simple steps in acquiring your own PCV licence and this should be completed in sequence. Processing can take an approximately 8-10 weeks.\nFor your medical, take the orange form (D4 or DLM1 in Northern Ireland) to your doctor for a fee of about \u00a3120. Once you have completed your medical you must send your D4 form along with your current driving licence and your completed D2 licence application form (available from DVLA Local Offices, Vehicle Operators Services, DSA and PCV test centres, Traffic Area Offices, PCV training schools and direct from DVLA), together with the appropriate fee. Send to D.V.L.A in Swansea.\nA provisional PCV licence should be returned within 10-14 days.\nLike when you gain your car driving licence you will require a provisional licence. This can be ordered from the DVLA or provided by the company you choose to train you. There is two parts to the form. Part D2 and part D4. It\u2019s also mandatory that you hold a valid British driving license as the basics of driven are not taught when training for your heavy goods vehicle licence.\nOnce you have received your provisional licence you can then book for the appropriate Theory Test .",

    "text": "In the silence, things are revealed.\nThings that cannot be heard in the noise of modern life.\nFor the most part, our culture fears silence because of its revelatory power, both good and bad. We do have so many secrets.\nUsually, the first thing us humans encounter in the silence is our thoughts. So we fear the silence because, we fear our own thoughts. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? The pesky ones we try so hard to push away are usually the first to surface.\nThat\u2019s a drag, so instead we block out the silence. We come home, we go to the fridge and we turn on the tv. We push our consciousness through a kind of predictable tunnel. And the tunnel has a weight, a momentum that is hard to break.\nIt takes a big experience like falling in love or the loss of a loved one to crack open the tunnel. But the thing is, no matter how life altering the experience, we have an uncanny way of eventually finding our way back to the tunnel where things are safe, warm and pretty doggone mediocre. Well, lately, mediocrity is even giving the tunnel too much credit. We\u2019ve sunk somewhere below mediocrity into absurdity.\nThen every once-in-awhile, in the silence you recognize an exciting thought that leads you down the rabbit hole. It stirs something within you, like the memory of a distant voice. Maybe it is hardly a voice at all and more like a feeling. It stirs you to action. Maybe you write it down. Maybe you make a collage. Maybe you fix something. Maybe you share your idea with another. Maybe you make the bed.\nOr maybe you just shut up and listen. And then respond. Listen. Respond. You begin to have a conversation with what is. In the silence, our senses unfurl, like tendrils. We hear the wind. Bird. We smell the air, and perhaps notice that when the sun comes out for a moment from behind the clouds on a grayish day, the grass responds to the sun by releasing a stronger scent. Smell the greeting of the grass and the sun.\nIt is all so alive.\nIn the silence, one can slip into the role of the third person who watches. From that perspective, when someone, let\u2019s say, cuts you off in traffic, you become frustrated for a moment, sure. You are yanked back down to a lower consciousness. But if you\u2019ve been practicing as the watcher, you are more easily able to slip back into higher consciousness.\nI don\u2019t mean to imply that the higher consciousness is a way to avoid emotion. You feel the anger but in the silence, you more easily and quickly move to another place, like finding shade on a hot day. Why stay hot when the shade is right next to you?\nMaybe to be enlightened means that you live in that higher consciousness all the time, or, I don\u2019t know, 90% of the time. Those people, from what I\u2019ve heard, have had some kind of major divine intervention. For most of us poor schmucks it\u2019s just something we have to practice. It\u2019s hard for a beginner like me and very time consuming, but also cleansing, like a good poop.\n\u201cAnd one should never underestimate the satisfaction of a good poop, I always say,\u201d says Mr. Octopus, who is, pretty much, enlightened.\nIt\u2019s called higher consciousness because it lifts you higher. Duh! Sort of like being high, but with better side affects.\nAnd I suspect there\u2019s more to the silence than even all of that. It\u2019s exciting. But for now, this is as far as I\u2019ve gotten.\nSo, what the hell? Turn off that tv once-in-awhile. Turn off that radio. Let the emptiness emerge and let the quiet part begin! Whoop whoop! The secrets are not as bad as we think. The truth is always better, even though its emergence is sometimes painful.\n\u201cLike a poop,\u201d says Mr. Octopus.\n\u201cYes, just like a hard poop,\u201d I agree.\nIn silence we can hear the truth of ourselves, and, well, it\u2019s not all bad! Geesh!\nThis entry was posted on Monday, December 13th, 2010 at 3:16 pm\tand posted in Favorites, Uncategorized.\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.",

Spring is Here - Shop Now & Save!\n* Be sure to use only fresh, good quality rhubarb. They should be fresh looking, crisp and blemish free. If the stalks are fibrous, be sure to remove the stringy fibers.\n* Clean the rhubarb thoroughly and cut into the size pieces you desire for the end product.\n* Be sure to use airtight freezer safe containers. If using freezer bags, be sure to remove as much air from the bag as possible before sealing.\n* Allow enough headspace in the freezing containers or bags before sealing to allow for expansion when the rhubarb freezes. Allow approximately 1/2 inch for pint size containers and 3/4 to 1 inch for quart size containers.\n* Place the rhubarb in the coldest part of the freezer so that they will freeze as quickly as possible. Store for up to 9 months.\nRhubarb and Strawberry Pie -- not enough flour is why.\n2.In a large bowl, mix flour and sugar. Add strawberries and chopped rhubarb. Toss with sugar and flour and let stand for 30 minutes.\n3.Pour filling into pie crust. Dot top with butter, and cover with top crust. Seal edges of top and bottom crust with water.\n4.Apply yolk to top of pie, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle with sugar. Cut small holes in top to let steam escape.\n5.Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), for 35 to 40 minutes, or until bubbly and brown. Cool on rack.\nis rhubarb poison to eat with an R in the month,like september etc.?\nYou can eat rhubarb stalks at any time. And not all rhubarb stalks turn red, so you don't need to be concerned about the color of the stalks, either.\nYou shouldn't eat the leaves because of the potential for oxalic acid poisoning. You'd have to eat a lot of rhubarb leaves to do serious harm to yourself, however. Cabbage, spinach, potatoes and peas all contain oxalic acid and most people never ingest enough to harm themselves.\nRight Brainers Rule Month - is there any books that have all holidays?\nChristmas Seal Campaign - do you think that the Neo-Cons would be low enough to set it up so it looks as though McCain~?\nEmployee Ownership Month - Employee Involvement Program.?",

    "text": "Did you know that the average American eats about 67 pounds of beef a year? It's obvious that we love our burgers and steak, but we seldom take time to think about the people and processes that are involved in producing the beef we eat. The beef industry is an intricate system that involves cattle ranches, feed lots, processing plants, and retailers. Each element is crucial in providing a safe and nutritious product to you.\nDid you know that Americans on average eat over half a pound of cheese per person each week? It's no secret that cheese is one of America's favorite foods. But how it's made may be a mystery to most people. Making cheese is a multi-step process that involves farming for feed, animal care, milking, cheese production, packaging, retail, and ultimately you the consumer.\nDid you know that the United States is the third largest cotton producer in the world? Cotton essentially is the fabric of America. Not only do we wear it, but it's in so many products we use. The cotton industry is weaved together with a network of farmers, cotton gins, and clothing manufacturers. The process begins with a cotton field and ends with the retailer who sells you your jeans.\nIt's common knowledge that honey comes from bees. But many people don't know how bees make it and why and what it can be used for. Honey making is a collective effort between nature and man. It's a process that's involves bee colonies, native plant life, agricultural crops, and of course beekeepers.\nDid you know that dairy industry produces billions of pounds of milk each year? Milk is a diverse product that is used in so many different ways. But many people are unaware of how it's produced. The dairy industry in the United States expands far beyond milk. From the dairy cow, to the packaging plant, and from retailers to consumers, it's a system designed to provide a safe and nutritious product.\nDid you know that Americans eat an average of 20 pounds of onions a year? It's a vegetable that's often under-appreciated, though most of us cook with it and eat it every day. Onion growers are hard working farmers who are dedicated to providing a quality product. From the field to the supermarket, onions take quite a journey before they reach you, the consumer.\nDid you know that peanuts aren't really nuts? They're legumes, making them a close relative to beans. Although they may have a case of mistaken identity, peanuts still make for a perfect snack. Peanuts are a versatile product and can be found in many of our favorite foods like candy, baked goods, snack foods and more. And because they're in such demand, peanuts are a desirable crop for farmers to grow.\nDid you know that America is the largest producer of pecans in the world? There's certainly a high demand for these tasty nuts. But many people are unaware of how pecans are grown and processed. The pecan industry in the United States produces a vast quantity of nuts each year to meet the demands of national and international markets. The pecan process involves growers, specialized equipment, cleaning and shelling plants, retailers, and of course consumers.\nDid you know that the United States is the second largest producer of pistachios in the world? There's certainly a demand for this nut due to its unique flavor. Pistachios are a desert crop, so they can be found growing in the American West. From the orchard to the processing facility and retailer, pistachios undergo quite a journey before they can become your afternoon snack.\nDid you know that there are about 26 different species of chile peppers? Some range from mild to scorching hot. But chile peppers add a lot more than just heat to certain foods. They add color and flavor. The chile pepper industry in the United States produces a vast quantity of peppers each year. These chiles will venture from fields to processers, spice producers, retailers and finally chile enthusiasts throughout the country.\nSalsa is more than a condiment. It's a dish that can be fiery hot, or sweet and savory. It's made of fresh ingredients that are full great flavor, and it's a healthy addition to some of our favorite foods. Salsa can be made many different ways. But what most salsas have in common are three key ingredients - chile peppers, onions and tomatoes. Each ingredient comes together in perfect blend of zesty flavor.\nTurf grass is great for landscaping. But it's beneficial in so many different ways. And growing and caring for it can be quite a process. Growing turf grass is a science. A lot goes into finding the right varieties to grow in specific regions. Maintenance and irrigation are important factors as well. All this hard work, so we can enjoy our favorite outdoor activities.\nThe United States is one of the largest producers of wine in the world. And with so many varieties available to us, it can take a lifetime to explore the complexities of wine. Winemaking is an intricate process that involves highly skilled people who grow the grapes, process them, and make wine. It's a product that reaches a wide consumer base. It can high priced or very affordable.",

It\u2019s standard to get gelatine in sheets here; I\u2019ve never seen powder. Sheets are much easier to use, but you can of course use powder instead. I googled a bit and most sites seem to suggest that one 1/4 oz (7g) packet of powder is equal to 3-4 sheets of gelatine. I would err on the low side, because I dislike really firm jellies, and in the case of the Cheesecake, Rearranged you aren\u2019t turning it out, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s on the soft side.",

Simply be aware of this law.\nAct 90 \u2013 amends La. Code Civ. Proc. Art. 2636(5) to allow for a reproduction of a security agreement certified by a financial institution officer to be deemed authentic for purposes of executory process.\nThe statutory authorization for the cancellation and a statement that the affiant has complied with all the requirements of said statute.\nIt must be notarized but need not be in authentic form or witnessed.\nThe filing of the affidavit with the clerk of court shall be authorization for the clerk to cancel the mortgages described in the affidavit.\nThe Clerk shall not be liable for any damages resulting to any person or entity resulting from the cancellation.\nThe affiant is liable to and must indemnify the Clerk. The affiant is subject to civil and criminal penalties for signing a false or incorrect affidavit.\nThe bill provides a sample of the Uniform Cancellation Affidavit. It basically recites the existing methods of cancellation with check boxes for the affiant to check in order to select the method that is being used to effect the cancellation. By signing the affidavit, the affiant attests that he has satisfied all the requirements of the specific law. The Clerk is not required to investigate whether these requirements have actually been met.\nWhat you should know: The importance of this law is to provide a standard form of the affidavit to obtain a release from the clerk of court. The affidavit itself is not the release. Clerks are posting this form on their websites and you should consider its use.\nThe name, address, and Louisiana license number of the issuing title insurance producer.\nThe name of the title insurance underwriter.\nThe name and bar roll number of the attorney who rendered the title opinion upon which a title policy is based.\nThe inclusion of the information shall not create additional liability on those named therein nor will it create a separate cause of action against them. This act is effective January 1, 2012.\nWhat you should do: Be certain that each act and mortgage contains the 3 items set out above. Recall that a part of the purpose of this Act is to provide information as to the attorney who performed the required title examination.\nAct 323 \u2013 amends the Code of Civil Procedure Articles 3421, 3431, 3432 and 3434, dealing with Small Successions. It is a succession or ancillary succession of a person who died leaving property in Louisiana having a gross value of $75,000 or less valued as of the date of death. It shall not be necessary to open judicially the succession of a person who died intestate, or domiciled outside of Louisiana whose testament has been probated by court order of another state. The bill eliminates the requirement that the immovable property left by the deceased be only a single lot or contiguous lots on which there exists a residence in which he or his spouse resided.\nWhat you should know: We are willing to rely on a small succession affidavit without court order completed in compliance with this Act provided you have no reason to believe that the stated value of the estate has been artificially reduced to avoid a court proceeding, this new affidavit can now be used on any type of real estate.\nAct 325 \u2013 amends R.S. 22:512 of the Title Insurance Act dealing with \"Definitions\" in order to define what an \"abstract\" is. Abstract shall mean a written history or summary of the recorded instruments indexed in the public records affecting the title to immovable property that is prepared and certified by an abstractor in accordance with the minimum search periods. It includes a photocopy or electronic copy of such instruments or extracts (take-offs) prepared by the abstractor. The abstractor must date and sign the abstract. \"Public records\" is defined as the mortgage and conveyance records and the property tax records. It allows for an attorney to do a stand-up examination of title. It defines \"title insurance business\" as including the examining of titles. However, any title insurance policy must be based upon an examination of the public records or a personal examination of an abstract by an attorney. The bill also amends R.S. 37:212(A)(2) dealing with the \"practice of law\" to state that it includes the certifying or giving opinions, or rendering a title opinion as a basis of any title insurance reports.\nWhat you should know: You should comply with this Act.\nAct 342 \u2013 amends R.S. 9:5557 to provide for a penalty to be assessed against a lender that does not timely provide a release for a mortgage that has been paid off. It does not apply to a mortgage that has been paid off by the obligor personally, but only to those mortgages paid by a settlement agent. The mortgagee is required to furnish an act of cancellation within 45 days after it receives notice from a settlement agent who has paid the indebtedness or within 45 days of receipt of payment. If the mortgagee does not furnish a cancellation to the settlement agent or cancel the mortgage within 60 days, it is subject to a penalty of $1,000, payable to the borrower. This amount increases by $500 for every 30 days thereafter, up to a maximum of $5,000. If the mortgagee fails to deliver a cancellation within 90 days of the payoff, then the mortgagor may institute summary proceedings against the mortgagee to have the mortgage cancelled. The mortgagor may collect the penalty, costs, attorney fees and damages. The statute is effective for mortgages passed after 2011.\nWhat you should do: Be aware that this Act applies only to a settlement agent. It is a good practice to maintain a calendar entry to remind you to check for a proper return of a release of a mortgage that you have paid and to follow up on such release. If not received by the end of the 90 day period to receive a release, you will need to notify the mortgagee and request that they file the proper suit to obtain the release. If such suit is not timely filed, please notify our claims department.\nAct 461 \u2013 amends La. Code Civ. Proc. Art. 253 (B) and enacts 253 (C) to establish as the official record of any filed document the electronically stored version.\nAttorney General\u2019s opinion 10-0281 \u2013 requires clerks to honor documents electronically certified by other governmental officials, effective February 10, 2011.\nWhat you should do: Nothing.

    "text": "Leap over the hurdles of tracing Polish roots\u2014our five-step guide will get you started.\nWhat do Marie Curie, Bobby Vinton and Pope John Paul II have in common? If you know their original monikers \u2013 Maria Sklodowska, Stanley Robert Vintula Jr. and Karol Wojtyla \u2013 it\u2019s easy to tell all three had Polish roots.\nNine million Americans share that heritage, making Polish the eighth-largest ancestry in the United States. Poland\u2019s influence on America goes all the way back to the Revolutionary War, when Polish nationalists Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who\u2019d fought unsuccessfully for their homeland\u2019s independence, helped lead Colonial forces to victory.\nThe many immigrants who followed brought along with them a vibrant culture, including recipes for signature dishes such as kapusta (sauerkraut), golabki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (dumplings); ornamental folk dress; and five national dances (Krakowzak, Kulawzak, Mazur, Oberek and Polonez).\nResearching your Polish roots can feel like one of those dances: Sometimes you move forward in rhythm, then a few sudden turns can throw off your footwork. But if you follow the five steps outlined here, you\u2019ll glide gracefully through there search process.\nStep 1: Cover the basics.\nAs with any genealogy search, the best place to begin your Polish research is at home. Scour your attic, basement, closets and desk drawers for documents, letters and photographs with family history clues-in particular, you\u2019re looking for certificates, deeds, passports and other items that might contain details such as immigration information (see step 3) and ancestral hometowns (see step 4).\nNext, interview your relatives to glean additional facts and family lore. Although oral history is never error-free-people\u2019s memories fade and change over time-it\u2019s an essential source for the names, dates and places you need to start your search. Record family stories in a notebook, and be sure to ask your interviewees if they have any photographs or documents, which can provide additional clues.\nThen reach out to the Polish genealogy community for help getting your search on track. Network with fellow researchers on the message boards at <boards.ancestry.com/localities.ceeurope.poland/mb.ashx> and <genforum.com/poland>, and via e-mail lists such as GENPOL <rootsweb.com/~jfulIer/gen-mail-country-pol.html#GENPOL>. Join Polish-focused genealogical societies.\nTry to hook up with relatives in the old country, too. \u201cBecause Polish families tended to be large, it\u2019s inevitable that your immigrant grandmother or great-grandfather left a sibling or two behind when immigrating to America,\u201d says Polish genealogy expert Jonathan D. Shea, a professor of foreign languages at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, Conn. Those siblings\u2019 descendant \u2014 your distant cousins \u2014 could help you fill in the blanks in your family tree. To locate relatives in Poland, search online telephone directories (try the ones at Poland GenWeb <rootsweb.com/~polwgw/wp.html>) or find a printed telephone book covering your ancestral region (most libraries have them) and write to people with your surname.\nStep 2: Learn about Poland\u2019s past.\nPolish history stretches back more than 1,000 years: According to legend, Mieszko I founded Poland in 966. It flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries as the Polish Lithuanian Union, a political entity resulting from Queen Jadwiga\u2019s marriage to Wladyslaw II Jagiello of Lithuania in 1386.\nIn the 1700s, however, Poland\u2019s three powerful neighbors-Austria, Prussia and Russia \u2014 carved up the country in the Three Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793 and 1795). Poland as a nation ceased to exist again until 1918, following World War I; it lost its independence once more during World War II, when the Russian and German offenses ravaged southern Poland and nearly 6 million Poles died. Poland was reborn as the Communist People\u2019s Republic of Poland in 1952, and re-entered the global economy in 1990, as the Rzeczpospolita Polska (Republic of Poland).\nThat turmoil-filled history will color very aspect of your genealogical research, beginning with your family\u2019s arrival in America. The majority of Poles journeyed to the New World during the time Austria, Prussia and Russia ruled their homeland: Immigrants began coming from Prussian-occupied areas in 1848; by the 1880s, the Austrian-governed province of Galicia and the Russian Empire were supplying a steady stream of Polish emigrants.\nThe influx peaked from 1880 to 1910, during America\u2019s \u201cgreat wave\u201d of immigration, with an estimated 3 million Poles in the United States by 1910, If your ancestors were among those immigrants, they didn\u2019t officially come from Poland, but from one of those other three nations \u2014 a fact to keep in mind as you research in immigration records. Because Poland\u2019s territory shrank over time, it\u2019s also possible your Polish forebears came from an area that\u2019s outside the modern nation\u2019s borders.\nStep 3: Determine the immigrant ancestor\u2019s name.\nSpeaking of immigration, your next step in following your clan back to Poland is retracing your immigrant ancestors\u2019 journey to America. To do that, you\u2019ll need to determine their original Polish names-which may or may not be the same ones they used in America. Like other immigrants, Poles sometimes \u201ctranslated\u201d their given names to the English equivalents (Jan becomes John; Katarzyna becomes Katherine). With surnames, they most often altered the spelling or pronunciation: Because Polish orthography is so different from English, immigrants wanted to make their names look and sound more American.\nSince that generally happened after they arrived in the United States, expect your ancestors to appear in earlier records \u2014 including their passenger arrival lists \u2014 with their Polish monikers. This is where it helps to understand Polish naming practices. Polish Roman Catholics, for example, would often name a child after a saint whose feast day was celebrated on or near the baby\u2019s date of birth or baptism. Books can help you determine given names in Latin, Polish and German, and find the proper spellings of surnames.\nAlternatively, you can get passenger lists on micro film at most large public libraries, from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) <archives.gov> and its regional research facilities, and from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 Family History Library (FHL) <www.familysearch.org> in Salt Lake City (rent the film to view at your local Family History Center, or FHC).\nStep 4: Find the ancestral home.\nThis is perhaps the most important step in the research process. To find records from the old country, you need to know where your family lived-just the name of a province or nearby large city isn\u2019t enough, because repositories file records by locality.\nHow do you get it? If you listened closely to your relatives and carefully examined family documents, perhaps you noted the name of a city, village, or at least a county or district that can serve as starting point for further digging. If none of your home searches turned up any clues, you\u2019ll now need to scour other sources to find out where your family came from. Try vital records, obituaries, cemetery and funeral records, church records, censuses, naturalization papers and the Social Security Death Index (also searchable free through Morse\u2019s Web site).\nOnce you have a specific place name, determine its location-along with pre- and post-WWI government and ecclesiastical jurisdictions-using a selection of maps, atlases and gazetteers. Because of Poland\u2019s turbulent history, administrative jurisdictions have changed numerous times. Historically, powiaty (counties)were the basic geographic division; while those still exist, the government introduced wojew\u00f3dztwa (literally, \u201cvoivodeships,\u201d but usually referred to as provinces) in 1975. In 1999, it consolidated Poland\u2019s 49 former wojew\u00f3dztwa into 16. PolandGenWeb\u2019s map <rootsweb.com/-polwgw/49provs.html> can help you sort out that reshuffling. Parish boundaries have shifted overtime, too-and they don\u2019t follow those of political jurisdictions. Gazetteers usually list which jurisdictions a town belonged to.\nThe FHL has an extensive collection of microfilmed maps and gazetteers, which you can find by doing a place search of the online catalog for Poland. When you latersc our the FHL catalog for Polish records (see step 5), be aware that the library uses place names from the 1968 Spis Miejscowosci Polskiey Rzeczypospilitej Ludowej by J. Jodlowska (Wydawnictwo Komunikacji i Lacznosci). Iwo Pogonowski\u2019s Poland: A Historical Atlas (Hippocrene Books) is also a good reference for resolving geographcal questions.\nOnline, try JewishGen\u2019s ShtetlSeeker <www.jewishgen.org/shtetlseeker> search of Eastern European towns, as well as online place-finding tools that focus on particular areas, such as Kartenmeister <www.kartenmeister.com> (Prussia) and Genealogy of Halychyna/Eastern Galicia <www.halgal.com>. You\u2019ll also want to explore the Federation of East European Family History Societies\u2019 Map Room <feefhs.org/newest_map.html>.\nStep 5: Hunt down records.\nNow that you know where your ancestors lived, you\u2019re ready to tackle research in Polish records. Luckily, you can get many of the documents you need \u2014 including vital records \u2014 stateside. As with other European countries, parish records are a staple of Polish genealogical research, as the Polish government didn\u2019t institute civil registration of births, marriages and deaths until 1946.\nThe FHL\u2019s microfilm collection covers parish registers from Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran and Orthodox churches throughout Poland, as well as some Prussian civil registrations (1874 to about 1880). To find those records, do a place search of the FHL catalog for your town name \u2014 be sure to look under both the Civil Records and Church Records headings. Then order relevant films at your local FHC.\nNext, consult other libraries with large Polish collections, such as Central Connecticut State University <www.ccsu.edu>, the New York Public Library\u2019s Slavic and Baltic Division <www.nypl.org> and the University of Pittsburgh <www. pitt. edu>, for materials relating to Polish-Americans\u2019 histories, traditions and communities.\n\u2022 Archives: Records from one registration district could be housed in multiple repositories, including a parish church, archdiocesan archive, local civil-records office or state archive. You\u2019ll want to check all the possibilities, which means getting familiar with Poland\u2019s archive system.\nThe State Archves of Poland-the country\u2019s national archive in Warsaw-is split into the Archive of New Records for post 1945 materials and the Central Archive of Historical Records for earlier documents. In addition, 30 state archives across the country hold records older than 100 years from their respective regions. Visit <archiwa.gov.pl/?CIDA=177> for links to each state archive\u2019s Web site, where you\u2019ll find contact information and a guide to its holdings. The SEZAM <archiwa.gov.pl/?CIDA= 376> and PRAD-ZIAD <archiwa.gov.pl/?CIDA=378> databases are also helpful for determining the locations of various records.\nYou can do research by mail, though PolandGenWeb\u2019s research guide <rootsweb.com/~polwgw/Research.html> cautions that since fees can add up quickly, you should set an upper limit in your request. Your inquiry will have the best chance of meeting with success if it\u2019s concise, specific and written in Polish. The Polish Genealogical Society of America provides several form letters at <pgsa.org/letterwriting.htm>, and you can download the FHL\u2019s Polish Letter-Writing Guide from Family Search (from the home page, click on Guides, then on Letter-Writing Guide). Or hire someone who\u2019s fluent in Polish to write the letter for you.\nLocal civil-records offices (urzedy stanzl cywilnego) are supposed to keep records from the past 100 years, but sometimes you can find older records there. The Polish Genealogical Society of Connecticut and the Northeast <www.pgsctne.org> has an index to vital records in Polish town halls covering 1880 to 1945; you can request a lookup for a small fee.\n\u2022 Religion: Since clergy served as the primary vital-record-keepers in Poland, knowing your ancestors\u2019 faith can help you root out their records more efficiently. Though Poland has been predominantly Roman Catholic, it also had Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population prior to the Holocaust, as well as Lutherans, Orthodox Christians and Greek Catholics.\nMany parishes retain their records rather than forwarding them to a state or church archival repository-and access is purely at the discretion of the pastors. Besides specifically requesting records, you also might try writing to a priest to find out if anyone in the parish has your surname of interest or might remember your family. Just keep in mind the clergy\u2019s interest in your genealogical pursuits can range from great cooperation to flat refusal.\nTo track down diocesan archives and their addresses, use the PolishGenWeb Help Pages at <rootsweb.com/-polwgwlhelppage.html>, Catholic Archives in Poland <www.aap.poznan.pl/index.php?idkat= 52> (in Polish) and Language & Lineage Press\u2019 database of Parish Affilitzons of Villages in the Former Archdiocese of Wilno by Jonathan D. Shea and Diane Szepanski <www.langline.com/Wilno.htm>.\n\u2022 Language: Depending on who was in power where your ancestors lived, their records could be in any of several languages. Records from Russian Poland, for example, were in Polish from 1808 to 1868, then in Russian until Polish independence in 1918. Austrian Poland\u2019s documents were kept primarily in Latin, though you\u2019ll find some Polish- and German-language records. In Prussian Poland, record-keepers used mostly Latin, with some in German and Polish. Read about Catholic record-keeping conventions at <rootsweb.com/~polwgw/pcr.htm>.\nYou probably can\u2019t become fluent in all those tongues, but you can get a working knowledge of genealogical vocabulary by referring to our cheat sheet of basic Polish genealogy terms at <www.familytreemagazine.com/polish>, studying the FHL\u2019s Polish, German and Latin word lists (available on Family Search) and consulting the books in the toolkit. If you\u2019re really ambitious, enroll in a Polish course at a nearby university. You also can contact a Polish genealogical society for a list of translators.\nFeeling the rhythm now? Once you\u2019ve found your groove, you\u2019ll see that keeping pace with your Polish ancestors is easier than you imagined.\nThis entry was posted in Polish Genealogy and tagged pole, vault.

    "text": "At a time when lots of my Mentor colleagues are at SAP\u2019s internal DKOM events, I had the opportunity to attend SAP\u2019s semi-public UK Technology Forum in St Albans on March 21st and spent day 1 there, mainly focussing on information around User Interfaces and Netweaver Gateway. As a regular TechEd visitor, events such as this are not providing you with a raft of new items around SAP products, but instead give you with a gut feel for the local customer and developer community.\nUser Interface and User Experience: demos and presentations were around HTML5 \u2013 either driven by Sybase Unwired Platform or developed straight using HTML5 and CSS3. For example, Keytree demoed an interesting live retail app for iPad that uses HTML5, hooked up to a SAP retail backend via homebuilt RESTful services. CompriseIT demoed a new SAP tool to generate native iOS consumption UIs for Netweaver Gateway services.\nGateway: I liked that most presentations clarified that not just SUP can be used for consumption, which was in contrast to information available during TechEd 2011 in Madrid, where participants often thought SUP is the only way to consume Gateway. I attended two interesting sessions by SAP labs\u2019 very own Yaad Oren, including a Kinect-enabled Gateway solution and a Siri-based prototype called SiPi (using Open Ears). In the latter, a video showed a SAP CRM lead being created using iPhone voice recognition and later an image was added to the CRM business partner by searching the person on Facebook, based on facial details. This is a very likely future use-case, yet it still makes me slightly shudder! (Disclaimer: the app is only a prototype!). As far as a wider developer engagement for Gateway is concerned, it seems that a reliance on the SAP partnering framework is the chosen path for now. Whether this will hamper the \u201cbillion users\u201d ambitions SAP has remains to be seen.\nThis entry was posted in Blogosphere, Conferences, SAP Market. Bookmark the permalink.",

    "text": "If you\u2019re looking for an affordable alternative to a light-commercial spin bike, the JOROTO GS60 is definitely worth having a look at. It\u2019s one of the newer bikes released by JOROTO in the second part of 2018. Although it\u2019s not a bike made for commercial use, it has a sturdy construction and can support most spin workouts. It also includes several accessories which other spin bikes do not have.\nThe JOROTO GS60 features quite a different frame design than most indoor cycling bikes. It\u2019s not a triangle frame, nor a V-frame; its longitudinal base section is actually composed of two bars which hug the flywheel at the front, while the seat tube and the handlebar tube are directly connected by the main bar of the frame. This being said, there is no step-up bar element above the crank, such as for the Sunny SF-B1805, or the Spinner P3.\nThe bike\u2019s frame is made of ovalized steel tubing, coated with a durable black paint which is resistant to corrosion. The seat and handlebar posts have a chrome plating finish, though, as well as the flywheel. Also, the bike\u2019s construction incorporates a few ABS parts. The side shrouds that cover the belt, the magnetic brake assembly, and partially the flywheel, are made of a durable ABS plastic material.\nThis JOROTO exercise bike isn\u2019t extremely heavy, compared to other spin bikes; for example, the Body-Solid ESB250 weighs approx. 145 lbs (~66 kg). However, its net weight still is ~90 lbs (~41 kg), which is more than twice the weight of the average mountain bike. This being said, the unit provides an excellent stability. Plus, both its bases have adjustable stabilizers, which allow you to perfectly level it on any type of floor.\nTransporting the bike once it was assembled isn\u2019t too difficult, though. Just like many other indoor cycling trainers, its front base is equipped with transport wheels. By pressing the handlebars forward and using these wheels to move the bike, you will only be handling approx. 1/3 of its total weight.\nThe fully assembled bike isn\u2019t extremely large. It is 49\u2033 (124 cm) long, and 20\u2033 (51 cm) wide. However, it\u2019s recommended to leave at least two feet of clearance all around it for ease of access and safe operation.\nThe JOROTO GS60 includes a high-comfort saddle. It\u2019s approx. 10.8\u2033 (27.5 cm) long, and 7.9\u2033 (20 cm) wide. It integrates a thick layer of foam cushioning especially in its rear section. Its rear part features two suspension springs which add more shock absorption. It also has a longitudinal groove in order to provide a higher breathability during seated workouts.\nAlthough it\u2019s a really comfortable seat for an indoor cycling bike and you may not need to replace it, finding a replacement for it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Its attachment system to the slider is standard. Therefore, compatible options for it should be available in any bike shop.\nThe seat is four-way adjustable (up, down, forward, backward). Its designed to suit users with an inseam between 27.5\u2033 to 35.4\u2033 (70 \u2013 90 cm). Differently put, the bike can accommodate users between 5\u20190\u2033 and 6\u20194\u2033 (153 \u2013 193 cm) with no problem, promoting a correct leg extension during pedaling. Also, the seat assembly is durable enough to support users up to 280 lbs (127 kg).\nThis JOROTO exercise bike is equipped with a multi-grip handlebar. It can provide at least four grips, including standard, parallel, aero, and race. It has a center loop aerobar to which the meter is attached. It is urethane dipped in order to provide a comfortable and secure grip.\nTwo elbow rest pads are included with the bike. Not many exercise bikes come with these accessories. A phone holder is also attached at the top of the handlebar post.\nFinally, the bike\u2019s handlebar is two-way adjustable. Its upright post provides approx. 5\u2033 (13 cm) of upright adjustment. It does not have a horizontal slider, and cannot be moved forward and backward as the seat.\nThe JOROTO GS60 is equipped with a mid-range, 30 lbs (13.6 kg), chrome-plated flywheel. It has a perimeter-weighted structure in order to provide a high inertia, great for spinning workouts. The pedaling motion is very smooth and pedaling in reverse is also possible. However, when pedaling in reverse, the resistance remains constant. This being said, you cannot coast on the bike.\nThe crankset is highly durable, designed to support any spin workout. Therefore, even if you\u2019re close to the maximum 280 lbs (127 kg) weight limit, you should be able to pedal while standing up with no problem. The crank arms are steel-made, and the pedals are made of a metallic alloy as well. The pedals feature adjustable toe cages but do not have clips for spin shoes. Their threads are 9/16\u2033 standard, though, so you can replace them with almost any type of bike pedals if you want.\nThe JOROTO GS60 features a manual magnetic resistance system. It is equipped with a magnetic brake pad which is attached to the tension knob on top of the main bar of the frame. When you turn the knob clockwise, the magnetic brake moves closer to the metallic flywheel increasing the magnet\u2019s pull. This results in a higher pedaling difficulty.\nSince the resistance system doesn\u2019t involve any friction, the usage of the bike is almost completely silent. The tension knob also fulfills the function of an emergency brake, though. You can press it down to instantly stop the flywheel. This is actually recommended, especially when pedaling at a higher speed, due to the fact that the flywheel is pretty heavy, and the pedals continue to spin for as long as the flywheel is spinning.\nThere aren\u2019t any pre-determined resistance levels marked on the bike\u2019s tension knob. But as a general idea, by tightening it all the way, the resistance generated will provide a very consistent workout.\nThe bike\u2019s internal transmission uses a poly-v belt. Just like any bike belt drive, it doesn\u2019t require lubrication. It also generates less vibration than a chain, the pedaling motion being very smooth and quiet.\nThe bike\u2019s exercise meter is a basic unit, but considering that many other spin bikes (even commercial ones) do not have this accessory, having it is quite a plus. Its LCD display shows time, distance, total distance, speed, and calories burned. It does not have a pulse reading function, and the bike does not have any integrated pulse sensors. Therefore, if you need to keep an eye on your heart rate during your workouts, you will have to use a separate device.\nThe meter unit only has one button and is powered by two AAA batteries. It starts up when you press the button or when you begin pedaling, and also has a sleep mode to which will enter after a few minutes of inactivity on the bike.\nBy pressing the button repeatedly you can select one of the values to be shown all the time on the display. You can also select its Scan function and with it set ON, all the values will rotate, each one appearing on the display for a few seconds. The unit\u2019s button can also serve as a reset button. You can press it and hold it for a few seconds to clear all the values on the meter to zero.\nThe core frame of the bike comes pre-assembled. The resistance elements, the flywheel, the crankset, the belt, and their covers are already in their places. Therefore, you only need to attach the two base stabilizers, the seat post, the saddle, the handlebar post, the handlebar, the pedals, the meter, and several other small parts. This shouldn\u2019t take more than 40-50 minutes. All the tools needed for it are included, and the manual provides very clear assembly instructions.\nFor maintenance, you only need to wipe off the sweat that may have fallen onto the frame during your workout, and periodically look for loose bolts and parts. The belt doesn\u2019t need periodic lubrication, and since the brake is magnetic, should not undergo any wear and tear, at least not for a very long period of time.\nNo LED backlight on the exercise meter.\nThe JOROTO GS60 is an indoor cycling bike made for spin workouts. It\u2019s equipped with a magnetic resistance system, a 30-lb flywheel, and a high-comfort seat. It offers superior micro-adjustability and has pretty sturdy construction for a home use trainer (can support users up to 280 lbs). It\u2019s a great bike for high-intensity cardio workouts, interval training, stamina and strength development, and of course, for burning a lot of calories. And finally, it costs less than half the price of a commercial-grade spin bike, while its overall quality is pretty close to light-commercial.",

    "text": "France is in a difficult position. It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to realize it. A capital strike against the periphery by both creditors in the Eurozone and international investors forced the periphery to adopt policies they would not have otherwise.\nLarge pools of capital, including central banks and sovereign wealth funds continue to buy French bonds, keeping yields near German levels. The logic is not so much about fair value based on economic fundamentals. Instead, it is a political judgment. Despite the divergence between German and French economic prowess, the two remain the twin pillars of Europe. As long as one is confident that EMU remains intact, then France's credit is as good as German credit.\nThat same logic, of course, can be applied to other euro area countries. On one hand, officials want investors to distinguish between different credit conditions. On the other hand, they insist they will not allow EMU to fail. As we have learned over the last couple of years, this does not preclude sovereign debt restructuring (Greece and Cyprus), and even capital controls (Cyprus).\nThe peripheral premium over Germany was narrower prior to the crisis. There was even a brief shining moment that Spain traded through Germany (this is to say that yields slipped marginally below German yields). Continued easing of ECB monetary policy can see spreads compress further. However, it is unreasonable to think the spreads can return to status quo ante, as the risk of debt restructuring must be perceived as higher than before.\nManagers of large pools of capital recognize there are not sufficient bunds available. Recall that next year, the German coalition government has committed itself to a balanced budget. That means new supply is not going to be forthcoming. French bonds are seen as the next best alternative, and they offer a slightly higher yield to boot. Simply, if crudely put, French bonds are to German bunds, what Agency debt is to US Treasuries.\nWithout the push of necessity, French politicians find it difficult to do the right thing. They are reluctant to declare a break from the German ordo-liberalism's drive for fiscal austerity, but refuse to embrace it. Last month, Hollande unilaterally declared no more effort to reach the EC budget targets that had already been postponed. The EC implicitly threatened to reject it, but reports suggesting that Merkel was reluctant to push France hard, possibly fearing to do to the AfD, what Cameron has done for the UKIP.\nInstead, the EC accepted some cockamamie sleight of hand. France would cut its structural deficit by 0.5% instead of 0.2% as Hollande initially proposed. This would be accomplished by 1) assuming lower debt servicing costs, 2) reducing its EU budget contribution, 3) proposing nearly a billion euro savings from a crackdown on tax evasion. Recall that Brussels had expected, and France had previously agreed to a 0.8% reduction in its structural deficit.\nPerhaps Merkel was worried about the rise of the National Front in France. Le Pen embraces the social welfare state of France. It sees the biggest threat to it, not coming from the discipline being imposed by what Thomas Friedman has called the \"golden straightjacket\", but by the encroachment of French sovereignty. The culprit is the German fist inside the EC glove and enshrined in the monetary union.\nYet the leaders of France's main political parties are doing more to boost the National Front than anyone, including, arguably, Marine Le Pen. She often claims that there is significant collusion between the major parties. She says that the Socialists and the UMP are a single self-interested group. The developments in France this week provide her with the proverbial smoking gun.\nConsider this: Hollande's chief of staff Jouyet is a personal friend of the French President. He also served in the Sarkozy government. He reportedly had lunch with Sarkozy's rival in the UMP, Fillon, who was also a prime minister in Sarkozy's government. Among the things they talked about was the investigation into overspending by the Sarkozy re-election campaign in 2012.\nWhat are not agreed upon are the reports that suggest Fillon, threatened by Sarkozy's attempt at a political comeback, wanted the Hollande government to expedite the investigation. The idea was hit Sarkozy quickly and hard to derail his hope to be elected as the head of the UMP next month. Yet, it does seem Sarkozy himself is struggling without any help. Ever since he threw his hat in the ring, his support in the polls has deteriorated. Last month, his candidate to head the Senate lost, suggesting Sarkozy's support in the UMP is not insurmountable.\nHollande's has the lowest support of any French president since the end of WWII. He is half-way through his five-year mandate, and he recently indicated he would not seek re-election if there were no improvement in the unemployment rate. It is an idle threat. Barring a miracle, he cannot win, and the Socialist Party may dump him. We might be witnessing the slow and painful death of the Fifth Republic. The other republics ended by war or a coup, but this one may be ending due to self-immolation. The Socialist candidate who ran against Sarkozy in 2007, S. Royal, who was once Hollande's life partner, used to talk about a Sixth Republic.\nAlthough Merkel is recognized as the outstanding leader in Europe, she is playing with a strong hand, the hand that holds the purse. France has a weak hand, and yet despite the lack of strong leadership, it has done remarkably well in pursuing its agenda. It has been given more time to reach the 3% deficit/GDP mandate. After years of complaining about the strong euro, in word and deed the ECB is now driving the euro lower.\nFrance has wanted the ECB to pursue aggressive monetary policy, which it now is. The ECB will likely increases the range of assets it is buying under its version of QE and if may include corporate bonds. Given that the French capital markets are more developments than most in the euro area, including Germany, its corporate bond market is among the largest. Almost 45% of the corporate bonds issued by Eurozone companies are accounted for by French businesses.\nAfter Russia occupied two areas in Georgia after the 2008 conflict, and its continuous in attempts to intimidate it neighbors, France thought it reasonable to sell Russia two ships that can be used for amphibious assaults. France has been reluctant to renege on its contract, which reportedly has penalty clauses for failure to deliver. However, within weeks of the expected delivery of the first ship, there is talk of an alternative. Reports suggest that NATO could be favorable disposed to buy the ships from France. Perhaps the logic is that it is better to own them then possibly fight against them.\nAsset managers are unlikely to declare a capital strike against France. The premium France pays over Germany for 10-year money is about 36 bp presently. In the past six months, the premium has approached 30 basis point a few times, but never penetrated. The mid-September low of 31 bp was the smallest French premium in three years. This seems to be the floor.\nThe ceiling seems to be about 47 bp, which it neared three times in the past six months, most recently on October 20. Recall that, in the four years before the crisis, there were several occasions where the French yield dipped slightly below the German yield. In any event, pre-crisis, France did not pay more than a 10 bp premium.\nNeither international capital, represented by asset managers nor the EC is going to force France to enact structural reforms. In addition, there is even less of a chance that Hollande makes a clean break and announces an aggressively pro-growth fiscal initiative. This means the continuation of the charade, yet the status quo is toxic. The political elite are committing a French version of hara-kiri. What fertile terrain for the National Front.",

    "text": "There is no specific blood test for lymphoma.\nLeukemia & Lymphoma Awareness month goes beyond wearing a colored ribbon or taping a flyer in a clinic window. Doctors should be attuned to differentials and patients should voice concerns over unexplained symptoms\u2014perhaps insisting on accurate testing rather than empirical evaluations.\nLymphoma is a cancer of the lymphocytes (white blood cells) that typically play a key role in fighting infection. The lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system, comprising a network of conduits called lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph towards the heart. Collections of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymphatic tissue is also located in other parts of the body, including the stomach, skin, and small intestine. A multidisciplinary approach is useful to optimally manage patients with rare or complex neoplasms.\nThere are two broad types of lymphoma\u2014Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and many subclassifications. The main difference between HL and NHL is in the specific lymphocyte each involves. Because of so many variations, it is not uncommon for medical practitioners to offer differing diagnosis for the same symptoms or even lab results. In fact, a second opinion of pathologist biopsy interpretation (whether negative or positive) may be equally, if not more, important than a second opinion for an oncologist\u2019s treatment plan. Differences between malignant and benign cells can be subtle and interpretations can be subjective.\nPeople with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nDry eyes and aching joints can be precursors to lymphoma since people with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop NHL. If you have Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, report any of the main early NHL symptoms to your general practitioner\u2014a painless swelling in a lymph node (gland), usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) lymphoma affects lymphatic tissue in parts of the body such as the stomach, gut, lungs and eyes. This B-cell lymphoma can, therefore, manifest dry eyes as secondary symptom.\nIn the United States, B-cell lymphomas (lymphocytes originating from bone marrow) account for about 85% of non-hodgkin lymphomas. The most common type is diffuse large B\u2011cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with average onset of 63-66 years of age. It is distinguished as a quickly growing mass within a lymph node.\nTherapeutic targets for diffuse large B\u2011cell lymphoma include RelA NF-\u03baB and IRAK4 Kinase.\nPrimary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) accounts for only 2% of all lymphomas. It is more prevalent among women in their 30s. PMBCL is similar to DLBCL but with fibrosis and generally localized in the middle of the chest. Both types respond well to treatment. Intravascular large B\u2011cell lymphoma is a rare subtype of DLBCL affecting blood vessels.\nThough most lymphomas manifest within internal organs, cutaneous T\u2011cell lymphomas (skin lymphoma or mycosis fungoides) can be observed externally. The problem with diagnosis is that there is great variation in appearance. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is not a disease but rather an inflam\u00admatory response to known or unknown stimuli that results in a lymphomatous-appearing but benign accumulation of inflam\u00admatory cells. Pseudolymphomas often show broad patches and plaques. They often mimic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Examples include actinic reticuloid, lymphoma\u00adtoid contact dermatitis, and lymphoma\u00adtoid drug eruptions.\nMycosis fungoides (MF) makes up 72% of CTCL. Sezary syndrome is an advanced, variant form of MF, which is characterized by the presence of lymphoma cells in the blood. Extensive thin, red, itchy rashes usually cover over 80% of the body in MF.\nClassic MF primarily arises in the double-clothed areas of the body: axillae, breasts, groin, and buttock primarily presented with thin, red, scaly, poorly demarcated plaques of at least 5cm in diameter. Over time the morphology tends toward thickening of the plaques to more erythematous prominence, and, of course, tumors that may ulcerate. Early MF can be subtle and usually lacks classic histopathologic signs, therein causing so much trouble for making the early definitive diagnosis. This is why I do not rely solely on pathology to confirm early-stage disease.\nSlow growing lymphomas have the best early cure rate. The dichotomy is that they are generally discovered after disease has progressed to an advanced stage. High-grade aggressive lymphomas are often symptomatic early on and are potentially curable with aggressive treatments.\nPain is not a primary symptom. Skin lesions that do not heal, deep or surface lumps in the neck, armpits, chest, breasts, abdomen or groin should be brought to the attention of appro\u00adpriate medical professionals. Diagnosis may involve a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and/or surgical biopsy of a swollen lymph node or bone marrow collection to determine A or B category of four progressive stages.  It is estimated that 9,290 men and women (5,070 men and 4,220 women) were diag\u00adnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2013.  Acording to the American Cancer Society, about 74,680 people, including children, (41,730 males and 32,950 females) will be diag\u00adnosed with NHL this year.",

A long-term contrarian investor by nature, he relishes the wild cyclical valuation swings that characterize the mineral exploration and mining industries.\n26:20: Dan asks Brian about the unique positioning of his company before its big discovery - in the middle of a 17-18 year bear market that made minerals as hated as they'd ever been. \"We walked into an IPO in the darkest days of the mining industry... maybe in decades.\"\n30:28: Dan asks Brian to sum up the basic history and prospects of Altius for his listeners, and Brian explains how he turned his company from the brink of bankruptcy.\n35:00: Brian explains how a great buying opportunity supercharged his company's royalties - \"we bought and bought and then we bought some more, and here we are today.\" Now, the royalties have grown from $3-5 million to $70 million since Dan's been following them.\n44:50: What could change in Brian's business model? Anything's possible - but as he says, \"I'm just gonna run with the guess that making gobs of money and having it compound at crazy rates for a long time will ultimately pay off.\"\n58:44: Dan takes a question in the mailbag from Carl T., who attempts to call him out for his claim that the U.S. Dollar has lost 95% of its value over the last 100 years. \"That doesn't make sense!\"",

    "text": "Is B/E Aerospace Inc (NASDAQ:BEAV) Going to Burn These Hedge Funds?\nDoes B/E Aerospace Inc (NASDAQ:BEAV) represent a good buying opportunity at the moment? Let\u2019s briefly check the hedge fund sentiment towards the company. Hedge fund firms constantly search out bright intellectuals and highly-experienced employees and throw away millions of dollars on research activities, so it is no wonder why they tend to generate millions in profits each year. It is also true that some hedge fund players fail unconceivably on some occasions, but their stock picks have been generating superior risk-adjusted returns on average over the years.\nB/E Aerospace Inc (NASDAQ:BEAV) investors should be aware of a decrease in hedge fund sentiment of late. BEAV was in 46 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios at the end of September. There were 50 hedge funds in our database with BEAV holdings at the end of the previous quarter. The level and the change in hedge fund popularity aren\u2019t the only variables you need to analyze to decipher hedge funds\u2019 perspectives. A stock may witness a boost in popularity, but it may still be less popular than similarly priced stocks. That\u2019s why at the end of this article we will examine companies such as Health Net, Inc. (NYSE:HNT), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:JEC), and Aluminum Corp. of China Limited (ADR) (NYSE:ACH) to gather more data points.\nIf you\u2019d ask most shareholders, hedge funds are viewed as worthless, outdated financial vehicles of years past. While there are more than 8000 funds with their doors open at the moment, We hone in on the masters of this club, about 700 funds. These hedge fund managers preside over bulk of the smart money\u2019s total capital, and by observing their highest performing picks, Insider Monkey has figured out a number of investment strategies that have historically beaten the market. Insider Monkey\u2019s small-cap hedge fund strategy surpassed the S&P 500 index by 12 percentage points a year for a decade in their back tests.\nKeeping this in mind, we\u2019re going to take a look at the new action surrounding B/E Aerospace Inc (NASDAQ:BEAV).\nHow have hedgies been trading B/E Aerospace Inc (NASDAQ:BEAV)?\nAt Q3\u2019s end, a total of 46 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -8% from one quarter earlier. With the smart money\u2019s sentiment swirling, there exists a few key hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).\nAccording to publicly available hedge fund and institutional investor holdings data compiled by Insider Monkey, Keith Meister\u2019s Corvex Capital has the largest position in B/E Aerospace Inc (NASDAQ:BEAV), worth close to $363 million, comprising 4.3% of its total 13F portfolio. On Corvex Capital\u2019s heels is Thomas Steyer\u2019s Farallon Capital holding a $207.6 million position; the fund has 2.7% of its 13F portfolio invested in the stock.

    "text": "George Zimmerman\u2019s online auction to sell the pistol he used to fatally shoot Trayvon Martin had reached $485,000 on Friday morning.\nThe bids were switched from GunBroker.com, which eventually said it wanted \u201cno part in the listing on our website or in any of the publicity it is receiving,\u201d to United Gun Group.\nThe new location deems itself a \u201csocial marketplace for the firearms community.\u201d Bidding on the 9mm Kel-Tec PF-9 pistol started at $5,000. Read more.\nThis sicko, who posted a photo of Trayvon Martin\u2019s body with the brag \u201cZ-man is a one man army\u201d on social media, is now seeking to profit from Martin\u2019s death and further bragging about his killing. \u201cDepraved\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be a strong enough word to describe this wretched punk.\nAgreed. By Torah law, one may not derive benefit from the gun. Yet this repulsive fellow is using it for his personal profit.\nWhich law?! Don\u2019t make up your own laws, and call them Torah laws.\nThe only punk in this story was Martin, who did not hesitate pummeling without mercy, who was exhibiting a typical burglary casing behavior such as walking between houses in the middle of the night, who had numerous marijuana and violence texts and pictures on his phone, who was suspended from school for possessing marijuana, who had marijuana in his system at the time his death. Nothing like that 12 year old kid picture circulated by the communist media \u2013 in five years from that picture to his death, Martin has morphed into a menacing street criminal complete with a gold grill and a nasty attitude. He had candy in his pocket?-Are you insinuating that anyone with a candy is incapable of committing a violent crime?!\n1) \u201cWalking between houses in the middle of the night\u201d. He was walking on footpaths that were meant for pedestrians \u2013 in other words doing nothing wrong whatsoever. Later he was running on footpaths to escape Zimmerman, because he was afraid of the stranger suspiciously following him.\n2) \u201cMarijuana in his system\u201d \u2013 what does that have to do with anything?\n3) Zimmerman refused to listen to the 911 dispatcher who told him to back off. Had he done so, a teenager who had done nothing wrong would have continued home, unharmed.\n4) Zimmerman posted a picture of Martin\u2019s body, bragging about the shooting.\n5) Zimmerman followed another man into a parking lot and threatened to shoot him in a road rage incident.\n6) He posted online filthy pictures of a woman he was angry at.\n7) He pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend and threatened her.\n8) He pointed a gun in his wife\u2019s face and hit her father.\nFollowing the letter of the law, Zimmerman was acquired of the murder charge \u2013 it was legally self-defense, albeit against a scared teenager who attacked a stranger who was following him. However, Zimmerman is clearly a thuggish punk who has a history of threatening people with guns, especially wives and girlfriends. Oh, did I forget racist too? Yep, he\u2019s posted several such those comments.\nYou are the one admiring a violent street thug named Martin, complete with the gold grill(very popular with gang members), taking phone pictures of guns, texting with his friends about fights and drugs. Oh, did you forget about pummeling Zimmerman. Pummeling someone means mercilessly hitting another human being in the head until a traumatic brain injury or death. Someone in his first fight doesn\u2019t have enough cruelty to just keep on hitting; it is very probable that Martin has done it before. Martin was walking in the middle of the night in a place where it wasn\u2019t customary and was suspicious, especially in the face of recent burglaries. Marijuana may or may not be a safe drug, but it definitely is illegal, Martin was involved with it, which is another proof that Martin was not this 12 year old innocent candy-lover that the media tried so hard to portray.\nRegarding Zimmerman, all the character flaws are inferred from his alleged behavior after the severe psychological trauma of the Martin incident, after the media\u2019s tarring and feathering to such an extent that Zimmerman\u2019s public reputation and employment opportunities are ruined, after spending all of his family\u2019s life savings to hire attorneys to defend against a typical governmental bullying tactic of prosecuting just for the purpose of prosecuting so that the target person buckles under pressure and takes a plea deal. Not even discussing the fact that most of your violent behavior by Zimmerman allegations are just words of other people without any physical proof; people, who may hate Zimmerman because of Martin or because of personal reasons, who understand very well the vulnerability of Zimmerman to allegations of violence, and it is no surprise that they may take advantage of the situation and hurt the man even further by their allegations. Regarding your feeble point of not listening to the 911 operator \u2013 Zimmerman was surveillancing from a distance until Martin went around and suddenly jumped Zimmerman; besides, gratefully, a citizen of this country doesn\u2019t yet have to obey every Herr Bureaucrat on the other end of the phone line. Calling Zimmerman racist?!-There were no any proven racist statements attributable to Zimmerman; the only racists in this story were Obama and the rest of the fascist socialists, who could not care less about the horrible epidemic of black people being shot by other black people or by Latinos, but getting all righteously angry because this particular Latino happened to have a Jewish last name of Zimmerman.\nMore lies, distortions and flat-out ridiculous conjecture, both in defense of Zimmerman, an unrepentant punk and attacking Martin, his victim.\n1) You are the one admiring a violent street thug named Martin\u2026 A lie. Actually two lies; Lie #1: No one \u201cadmired\u201d him or said he was a good guy; if anything the opposite was said when saying Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal was legally just. Lie #2: \u201cViolent Street Thug\u201d? Would this be Martin with zero arrests? Or Zimmerman, who had a previous arrest for attacking a cop and a previous restraining order placed by his girlfriend?\n2) You \u201cforgive\u201d every single one of Zimmerman\u2019s subsequent violent incidents, including those where guns and death-threats are used, because of \u201cpsychological trauma\u201d caused by his arrest and trial in the Martin case? He now has a lifetime get-out-of-jail-free card because of that arrest? Are you insane?\n3) \u201c\u2026a citizen of this country doesn\u2019t yet have to obey every Herr Bureaucrat on the other end of the phone line.\u201d Saying that Zimmerman should\u2019ve listened to the 911 operator is the equivalent of Nazism? Once again, are you insane?\nYour post is so riddled with idiocies (do you even know what \u201cinferred\u201d means? are you aware of Zimmerman raising a large amount of money, then illegally lying in court about it?) that only a few of them are addressed here. But hey, keep defending this creep even after his next domestic violence episode(s); nothing is his fault.\n1 So now you get all angry when accused of admiring Martin, while it was you who first accused me of admiring Zimmerman; typical liberal hypocrisy. You lied: Zimmerman had no arrests prior to the Martin incident, while Martin got kicked out of school for being involved with drugs and violence.\n2 Try to take a course in reading comprehension, as you missed my point that Zimmerman at the time of the incident was a good boy, while Martin was bad, involved with gang lifestyle, violence and drugs. Whatever Zimmerman allegedly turned into after the incident, has no relevance to assessing his character at the incident.\n3 So do we have to obey every gubmit employee or do we have constitutional rights?! Please answer, Herr Kommandant!!!\n4 So can you bring an actual instance of Zimmerman\u2019s racist statements?-Muslim is a religion, not a race, and you have no other racist statements by Zimmerman, so here you lie again.\nAs for you referring to my post as riddled with idiocies, I won\u2019t argue with an apparent expert, as it takes one to know one.\nI have made all my points, some multiple times, and will not further reply to your ignorance and lies.\nPS please look up inferred in a Webster\u2019s dictionary.\n1) You are a liar and/or don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Zimmerman was arrested in 2005, several years before he shot Martin. He also had a restraining order filed against him in 2005 for domestic violence.\n2) Martin was suspended from school three times, not \u201ckicked out\u201d, i.e. expelled. His suspensions were for graffiti and marijuana. \u201cGang lifestyle\u201d? Pretty wimpy gang. Violence? Another lie. Drugs? Marijuana.\n3) \u201cHerr Kommandant!!!\u201d You love calling people you disagree with \u201cNazis\u201d, don\u2019t you? What a sicko.\n4) Trying to play semantic games by saying a bigot isn\u2019t a racist? First of all, bigots are usually called racists too, whether their bigotry is religious or race based. Second of all, he is clearly a vile bigot, so I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re trying to prove \u2013 that he\u2019s \u201conly\u201d a bigot but not a racist? Third of all, he called President Obama an \u201cignorant baboon\u201d in a post, so there\u2019s your racist statement.\n5) When someone commits domestic violence against several different women over the years, including threatening some with guns, fights with a cop, follows another motorist into a parking lot and threatens to kill him, and several other incidents, character flaws aren\u2019t \u201cinferred\u201d. Look up what the word means. Here\u2019s a hint \u2013 we don\u2019t \u201cinfer\u201d that the sun rises in the East.\nThis pistol fetched such a high price because people understand its meaning as a symbol of freedom: it didn\u2019t just save a life(and there can be no freedom when people are petrified of street gangsters) of one individual from a violent bully, it also symbolizes a court victory of an individual against a bullying federal government which tried to railroad an innocent man for political reasons. The bidders understand, and they put their dollars where their appreciation for freedom is.\nWill this cause riots?-Not in a state where people are armed and able to defend themselves. The street thugs attack those who look like easy targets.\nHe is a sicko and so are the bidders, but since the USA are not supposed to be the jungle, authorities should confiscate the gun. I appreciate what the Gunbroker website did, at the expense of their own commission.",

    "text": "In the user research community the terms qualitative and quantitative are as common as the term UX itself. But often times new designers can get tripped up by the terms. Part of the confusion comes from the various, and sometime confusing applications of the terms. They can refer to the research activity (e.g qualitative study), the data from a research activity (e.g. quantitive data) and sometimes they refer to the analysis of the data from a research activity (quantitive analysis). Its no wonder non-practitioners can get confused. Fortunately, there is a simple way to keep the two concepts straight in your head. If you can grok that the term qualitative is derived from the word quality and the term quantitative is derived from the word quantity, then you\u2019re 90% there. Quantitative data is information that can be represented and evaluated in numerical form. In other words, Quantitative data, derived from the word Quantity, can be counted and objectively measured. Qualitative data is information that is descriptive and anecdotal in nature. In other words, Qualitative data, derived from the word Quality, is subjective and preferential and cannot be objectively measured.\nthe samples sizes used with each.\nThe next few section provides some additional details and examples you can use to further distinguish the two concepts.\nSelecting one or more value(s) from a given list.\nDid you enjoy reading the book (yes or no)?\nWhich of the following books are your favorite (Book A, Book B, Book C, None of the above)?\nOn a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 = not at all and 7 = very much, please tell me how much you enjoyed reading the book.\nKeep in mind that this is not always the case, but as a rule of thumb, you can rely on this.\nQualitative Data is typically the results of the researcher asking a research participant a set of questions that are Open-ended in nature. Opened ended questions allow the research participant to compose their own answer.\nHow did you enjoy reading Book A?\nWhat were your favorite parts of Book A?\nAgain, this is not always the case, but as a rule of thumb, you can rely on this.\nAnother common difference between Quantitative and Qualitative research is in how the feedback is collected from the participants. Again, as a general rule, Quantitative research uses indirect observations, sometimes through instrumentation to collect customer data. And Qualitative research uses direct observation methods to collect customer data. Indirect observation, simply means the data is not recorded by the research, but instead the data is recorded either by a system or another individual and then reported to research later. A classic example of indirect observation is website analytics data. Through website analytics, a researcher can observe the paths users take through a website to complete a task in a natural environment. Direct observation means the researcher records the data as it is observed. A standard usability study is a classic example of direct observation. Just like the website analytics, the research can observer the path a user takes through a website to complete a task, but in an artificial environment that allow that affords the researcher opportunities to interject with questions that provide insights into the research participant\u2019s decision making process.\nOne of the primary drivers for the different observation methods is the samples sizes of the two different types of research. Without going into the long technical reasons and evidence for a concept known as statistical significance, I\u2019ll just say that In order for quantitative data to be legitimate, a large enough number of participants need to be tested. The larger the number, the greater the confidence in the outcome of research. Data from large sample sizes are easier to collect through indirect observation. As such, quantitative data is typically collected through indirect observation. It would be too costly and time consuming for a researcher to attempt to collect a significant amount of data through direct observation. Because qualitative research is not based in math, but rather based on anecdotes and descriptions, smaller sample sizes are acceptable.\nAs you can see, there are a variety of ways to consider, characterize and compare Qualitative and Quantitative research, data and analysis. But at the end of the day, the difference between Qualitative and Quantitative data all comes down to measurement of the data. Quantitative data can be counted and is easy to measure. Qualitative data cannot be counted and as such is more difficult to measure. At least, this is the easiest way to distinguish the two.",

    "text": "East Cobb\u2019s Blistering Pope and Walton High Housing Markets \u2013 Spring/Summer 2015!\nThis is a look at two of the hottest hyper-local real estate markets in Marietta\u2019s affluent East Cobb community. Market activity in the Pope and Walton High School Districts have been off the charts so far in 2015. (I will be posting about the Lassiter High District in a future edition.) Historically, the markets in East Cobb\u2019s trifecta high school districts, Walton, Pope, and Lassiter have brisk buyer activity starting in early spring around late February to March. From there as buyers jockey for the ideal home in their chosen school system(s) market activity and buyer competition grows stronger each month, month over month until June/July when things peak and gradually start to cool off.\nI thought 2014 had some very good numbers, and 2015 has been another good year for me, but I had no idea how good the market itself was overall. While doing some research for a special project I parsed the data in these two highly acclaimed high school systems and uncovered stats for sales through July 15th, that not only beat 2014\u2019s numbers, but some took me by complete surprise \u2013 and I live and work here every day! It\u2019s one thing to dig up the data on a particular neighborhood where I am listing a home or helping buyer clients get the best price, but it\u2019s another thing to dig up custom highly targeted housing market data on an entire school system \u2013 or two! I say custom highly targeted data because this level of data granularity is not available in the monthly MLS market reports I get as a Broker/Owner, and it is not posted on any realtor or public website. This level of detail has to be manually/digitally hand extracted using comprehensive and accurate MLS tax and courthouse data!\nSo, what surprised me about 2015 Walton and Pope market data? Several things: 1. The percentage of homes that sold for 98% or better of LP(List Price) \u2013 in-fact, the real surprise was the sheer number of homes that sold for 100% (or more) of the List Price! 2. The number of Days on Market (DOM) \u2013 historically good average DOM for an East Cobb home in good condition and well marketed are 50-70. Most areas in metro Atlanta have far longer average DOM times than this. In 2014 average DOM in these two East Cobb school districts were an exceptional 45 days or so \u2013 very strong. The 2015 Days on Market stats in these two school systems are astounding \u2013 the mid 30\u2019s. That\u2019s very fast \u2013 remember we\u2019re not talking about a specific neighborhood micro market stat \u2013 but an entire housing market! But the real surprise \u2013 the high percentage of homes that sold in 10 days or less, and the majority number \u2013 homes that sold in 30 days or less. I have lived in East Cobb since 1996 and practiced real estate here since 1998 , and I can\u2019t recall such hot overall market numbers.\nAverage Days On Market: 37.8 \u201394 properties sold in only 0 to 30 days from the Listing Agreement \u2013 only 44 properties required over 30 days for a Binding Sale.\n-of 138 properties, 100 sold for at least 95% of List Price \u201369 properties sold for between 98% to *108% of List Price \u2013 *a result of multiple offers on some homes and for others, prices were raised in order to provide some buyer closing costs \u2013 many of the sales exceeding 100% of List were priced in the same exact amount as the seller paid closing cost listed! -Of the 38 properties that sold for less than 95% of List Price, the average List Price vs Sale Price was 91.39 % of List Price.\nAverage Days On Market: 35.7 \u201370 properties sold in only 0 to 30 days from the Listing Agreement \u2013 only 32 properties required over 30 days for a Binding Sale.\n\u2013 85 sold for at least 95% of List Price \u201360 properties sold for between 98% to *106% of List Price * a result of multiple offers on some homes and for others, prices were raised on in order to provide some buyer closing costs \u2013 many of the sales exceeding 100% of List were priced in the same exact amount as the seller paid closing cost listed!\n-Of the 17 properties that sold for less than 95% of List Price, their average List Price vs Sale Price was 90.44% of List Price.\nA ton of useful and in a few cases even unexpected information was gleaned and will be used on behalf of our existing and future buyer and seller clients.\nA similar study was just completed for the summer/fall market in 2014 to see how that data compares with our projections for the upcoming summer /fall market this year. We are expecting at least equal or better results, and insights into specific agent and builder negotiations will be helpful in moving forward.\nTakeaways for Buyers: In these markets, be pre-approved with a lender, be ready to act when the right home is found, and hire the most qualified buyers representative you can find \u2013 the agent/Broker you hire will make or break your deal. Contact an experienced buyers representative to partner with early in the process so they can assist and guide you in the right direction for your family\u2019s needs and lifestyle! Too many buyers start out trying to look around on their own and waste a lot of time before calling an expert. You already have a job \u2013 trying to learn a new career will not serve you? By \u201ctrying to learn the market on your own\u201d you will waste valuable time, look in the wrong places, and ultimately miss out on some great opportunities.\nTakeaway for Sellers: To get top dollar and a quick sale, your home needs to be in well maintained condition, and preferably certain updates have been done. Second, hire the best marketing expert you can find- one who can help you not only get your home in the correct shape, help you stage it if necessary, but can prove an exceptional marketing plan and superior exposure and past results for sellers. *There is a huge difference between seller results and the stats high volume listing machine agents like to boast about \u2013 such as number of transactions per year \u2013 it may sound counterintuitive, but volume only tells how the agent did for themselves \u2013 it says nothing about how their seller clients fared!\nContact me for more information about East Cobb homes, schools, or markets.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged East Cobb Housing Market 2015, Pope High School Homes, Pope Home Market Stats, Walton High School Homes, Walton Home Market Stats, Walton Pope Lassiter by admin.

Crash on the couch or armchair, doing a little channel surfing on the flat-screen TV with cable.\nBoth bedrooms have fun tropical d\u00e9cor, queen beds and en-suite bathrooms, ideal for two couples traveling together. You also get all the comforts of home with amenities like Wi-Fi, washer and dryer, linens and beach towels and starter kit of paper and cleaning supplies.\n1. Sea Turtles, Dolphins and Whales\u2026Oh My!: Grab a front-row seat on the private lanai to an amazing show. From your perch on the top floor, you\u2019ll see turtles and dolphins play in the waves year round, and humpback whales swim through the area in the winter months.\n2. Upscale Pool and Deck: Clear your schedule\u2026you\u2019re going to want to spend all day soaking up the sun on the gorgeous deck with multiple levels, tiki hut and lounge chairs. Splash down in the plunge pool to cool off with the waves of the Pacific rolling in the background.\n3. Quiet Condo Complex: Part of the intimate Poipu Palms community, the condo is one of 12 and sits on the top floor for privacy, peace and quiet.\nGather up the beach chairs, umbrellas and sand toys and walk the 10 minutes down to pretty Poipu Beach. If you\u2019ve got enough stuff for an army, pack up the car instead and make the quick 2-minute drive.\nIf you want to get the blood pumping, hike the Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail, which is chock full of amazing photo stops perfect for Instagramming. Adrenaline junkies will love zip lining, aerial obstacle courses and a wide variety of watersports.\nThe building from the street view looks a little dated. The unit itself is very nice. It is updated and fresh. Very clean. The rear wood deck is beautiful tropical hard wood.The view is spectacular. You feel like you are on the water. --- Mahalo, Ben!\nBalkony, Location, Pool and View are wonderful! Apartment could have been cleaner, still we had a very nice stay!\nPoipu Palms 302 is just as advertised - lovely views out into a cove (we watched a lot of sea turtles and even saw a few spinner dolphins passing through). There are effectively two suites, which gave us plenty of room to spread out and would give two couples enough privacy. The lanai and living room were wonderful places to relax. An easy walk (0.5 mi) to the Grand Hyatt (several restaurants and a beach) or Brenneckes Bar (laid back) and beach-front park. Everything was clean and the kitchen had everything we needed for breakfast, lunches or a simple dinner. The condo was in a quiet area - no noisy neighbors and (somehow!) none of the roosters Kauai is infamous for. GVR is great to work with - very responsive and helped with a few special requests.\nMy friend had a medical emergency the day after we arrived, and my attempts to reach 911 didn't work; I'm not sure why. Not knowing what else to do, I called the GVR office to explain what was happening, and Janie (I think it was Janie) stayed on the line with me while contacting the paramedic squad. Within 5 minutes, the emt crew was there, and shortly after that, Mark arrived to ask if there was anything he or GVR could do. That gesture meant a great deal. He stayed for at least half an hour, to make sure we were OK. Thank goodness my friend recovered and we were able to enjoy the rest of our vacation. Everyone at GVR was so friendly and helpful, and genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasant one. MANAGER RESPONSE: We are so glad that everything worked out for your friend. What a scary experience! Glad we could help in anyway possible. We hope to see you again!\nWe enjoyed everything about the property! The location is superb; the amenities (including the wonderful-smelling toiletries!) are great. Having dishwasher detergent and Tide pods supplied was a plus. The lovely dishes added so much ambiance with their colorful fish and ocean design. The balcony was perfectly situated to allow the best ocean view, and we spent many relaxing hours there, just watching the waves come and go. Very peaceful and quiet! MANAGER RESPONSE: Mahalo! We hope to see you again soon!\nVery impressed. Bruce was my \"goto\" guy and was very attentive and responsive. We had one issue that was NOT related to the property itself or GVR but a different property manager on a unit below ours. I contacted Bruce and he instantly got things resolved and came up with a resolution. It was over and beyond what I expected.\nThis property is very well equipped with little amenities that made it very special. The furnishings and condition of this rental is extremely nice. It will be a great pleasure to any and all who stay here.\nOur stay at Puipo Palms was great! The location was unbeatable with awesome views. The pool, though small, was never crowded and has beautiful ocean views. You could hear and see the waves crashing (and sea turtles swimming!) right from the patio. The beach was an easy 5 minute drive with easy parking or 10-15 minute walk. The beach was great for snorkeling (we even swam with sea turtles and saw the monk seals playing in the water 20 feet from us!) The waves can be intense but this beach is well protected and great for kiddos though not crowded. Breneckes restaurant right across the street had the best lunch and drinks! There are plenty of shops and other restaurants another 5 minutes down the road. The only complaint we had is that one of the beds is so firm we opted to sleep on the couch instead. The other bed, though softer, squeaked and sagged a little. We informed the hosts and they came out and looked at them. They did some adjusting to the bed that squeaked and we didn't have any trouble after that but we still didn't sleep on the firm one. If you're looking for a place to stay with awesome beds, this might not be the one for you. The internet was also a little spotty if you had more than a couple devices connected. Otherwise the apartment was clean and the kitchen was well stocked, complete with a blender. The only thing we were missing was a coffee grinder and they brought us one right away when we asked. They provide a list of farmers markets to attend and great reference books for what to do on the island. We would definitely stay in Poipu again!\nLovely stay. We had a great surprise when we saw the pool. You should promote it in the property description.\nThe view is unbelievable! we saw dolphins and sea turtle right out the balcony.\nNever actually spoke to them personally, just emailing back and forth. Great response from everyone with answers to my questions, etc. And I asked about a possible early check in because we were going to arrive early- I was about to call and actually got a text that it was ready. Great timing!!\nBeautiful spot, close to the beach and short drive to shopping/restaurants. Nice and clean and well stocked with everything you need. Great lanai to just sit and watch the ocean. Very comfortable beds and lots of room. Lots of fans and the set up of the windows lets the air move around the condo nicely- never got hot inside! Pool area was adequate- not a large pool, but nice to take a dip in -I'd rather be at the beach anyway ;) Overall excellent stay!!\nGreat location and price. Right on the water and right up the street from Poipu beach. Had everything you needed in a rental and was very comfortable. GVR was great at communicating check in info and making sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend staying here.\nExcellent stay with all amenities included. Lots of kitchen utensils and beach gear, the staff have definitely thought of everything so you can have a worry-free vacation and feel at home.\nEach team member was extremely helpful. They answered all of my questions promptly and with a positive attitude. They were all very friendly.\nAs always, our stay in Poipu Palms was excellent. We enjoyed the beautiful views and the great condo. We were impressed with the amenities available such as shampoos, conditions, soap (which smelled wonderful), toilet paper, paper towels, etc. The staff was extremely helpful with making sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable. This was our first trip with our daughter (she is 1) and this area was perfect. We were able to have a pak n play delivered to use before we even arrived, enjoyed taking her to the newly remodeled pool area which was great and was even able to do a late checkout which was so very helpful with hour daughter. I enjoyed the welcoming and departing text messages-very thoughtful!!! We will be back soon :) MANAGER'S RESPONSE: I am so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Our goal is to be sure our guests are enjoying themselves while staying with us. I hope you get an opportunity to come back and stay with us again someday -- and bring you daughter!!!\nThis team was amazing. I tend to have a lot of questions and want to make sure every box is checked, and sometimes rechecked. They were so helpful and always responded in a timely manor. I loved that they texted me as soon as we landed that our condo was ready for us to check in and to let me know what number to contact if I had any more questions. MANAGER RESPONSE: Mahalo for your review! So happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. Also, it i nice to hear that our texting service is helpful. It is sort of new for us and we love it! Hope to see you again soon.\nThis property was fantastic! its a small 12 unit complex so we never felt like there were too many people around. The unit was perfect for us and had everything we needed to make us feel like we were at home. We loved laying by the pool at the end of the day and watching the turtles below. The one thing I would like to mention is that the grill is a charcoal grill and the coals were sometimes hard to keep lit due to the breeze. There is also no cover for it so it takes a little longer for somethings to cook.\nThey were always really nice and got back to me within a reasonable amount of time. The unit number they originally sent me was not accurate but once I called they were easily able to figure it out and everything went perfectly after that.\nThe view was fantastic. We were able to see a whale spouting as well as dolphins from our balcony.",

    "text": "Discussion in 'SUS VENATOR CLUB' started by Bama, Mar 7, 2018.\nDid some stalk hunting going from field to field. This field usually has a bunch of hogs at the feeder and is accessible without spooking the hogs if at feeder. I estimate a dozen hogs in field with this big boar watching them feed. He was standing about 20 yds from feeder just watching the other hogs eat or sizing up which sow he wanted a date with?\nWalked far enough in to clear shooting house and set up sticks. Shooting a 300 BO with Barnes Bullets 110 gr TAC-TX hand load. I shot drop right there. Gun jammed after third shot. May have hit another hog running but did not have too much time to look.\nThis was about a 75 yard shot using a Pulsar Trail XP 50 with DLOC mount. I'll post video in hunting section.\nlonepunman, Juanthelawnmowerthief, Duffy and 7 others like this.\nLooks like a set of double tusks on that boar.. Congrats on the Sus boar - and trophy choppers too!\n30 Herrett - The best all out terminal performance on hogs and deer out to 300yds the 30 Herrett is it. The round hits like Thor's hammer, DRT. A perfect match for Texas hog hunters.\nThe 6.8 SPC is the fastest growing and #1 choice for hunting deer and hogs with an AR15.\nWar Eagle or Roll Tide? Figure it's the latter with 'Bama'.\nNice beast dang I can smell the stench from here big ol feller.\nFYI not sure if the malfunction is a rarity with your 300, but if it's a regular thing I have about 250 rounds through the RNZ Unimag and it's fantastic so far. The anti-tilt follower is quite ingenious....I think...so far. Tilts to the rear so the front of the follower can't dip down. 1st round to last loads like a dream. Anyway thought I'd bring it up my buddy found them researching for CProducts mags. Took a chance...liking them so far. They take 300bo, 6.5, both flavors of x39, 450, .223...all in one.\nCongrats on that big ol' boy.\nMany thanks 437! I'll give that a try. I went back to the lodge and cleaned the 300 BO real well thinking that might be a problem. I've been shooting it quite a bit in last couple weeks and kinda lost track of cleaning. Also, I filed down the rail on inside of .223 mag. Saw on Utube that helps line them up better. Thanks for the heads up and I'll give RNZ Unimag a try.\nIt looked like the ground shook when he fell.\nYea it may have just been gunked up. Went out last night and got SKUNKED.....I mean total. I did not see a deer, possum, raccoon, squirrel, armadillo....nada...obviously no yotes or hogs. What a bizarre ghost town.\nThanks! Need to get back out there and let some lead fly! Just got a 6.8 SPC upper from Eric at Blackstone Arms and some 120 gr Cavity Back bullets.\nVery nice boar! Good going. I like the way you marked the 300 mag. I am going to do the same, don't want no problems!\nI have an upper from Eric too. I don't reload but would love to try those cavity backs.\nHe is working on adding the sale of loaded rounds in SPCII potency. Keep your ear to the ground.\nJoeBano - Magazine - Spray Painted with brown paint , let dry then white paint pen and stencil sheet from Hobby Lobby. I too don't want a mishap! Thanks and enjoy!\nBig nasty ugly muggly down! Congrats.\nIn the ecosystem thanks you\u2026 he pirated a lot of resources to get that big.\nGood photos as well - they can be tough to get.",

    "text": "When it comes to raw specs, the Acer Predator Triton 700 sits pretty high atop the gaming laptop market. There is so much power packed into an impossibly thin chassis here \u2013 it's an impressive triumph of engineering. That said, it's not unique for a high quality laptop to be both thin and powerful.\nBoth the Zephyrus and the Alienware beat out the Triton's $2,999 (\u00a32,999, AU$4,999) price tag while including arguably better screens. That said, all three laptops have G-Sync enabled displays to cut down screen tearing and 120Hz refresh rates.\nThe Triton 700\u2019s jumping-off price is $1,999 (\u00a32,999, AU$4,999). That drops the graphics card down to a GTX 1060 6GB and cuts the RAM in half, but otherwise they're identical machines. The entry level model isn't available in Australia, so, if you really want one, it will set you back AU$4,999. In the UK, the available models aren't yet for sale, but they're identical to the US, with the exception of the higher-end Triton having 1TB of storage.\nValue-wise, the Triton runs neck and neck with the Zephyrus and Alienware. They trade some features for others, but none of them really leap ahead in terms of value when up against the other. They're all enormously expensive, even at their lower-end models.\nThe inside, however, is quite attractive, but simultaneously takes some getting used to. Form follows function, but in the case of the Triton, it's hard to figure out what elements influenced its unusual design. There isn't a track pad below the keyboard, like you'd expect to find. Instead, the keyboard runs all the way along the bottom edge and a beautiful piece of glass sits directly below the screen.\nThat glass is the Triton's touchpad, and it's positioned directly above the graphics card. In fact, you can see elements of the GTX 1080 beneath it, subtly lit from below. Using it feels wonderful. The Gorilla Glass is familiar to the touch, and fingers glide across it effortlessly.\nFor games that can be played with a trackpad, like FTL for instance, it's definitely a pain. Instead of shifting a finger down from the keyboard to trackpad like on an ordinary laptop, you need to move your entire arm. Not such a big deal when web surfing, but it's not fun when playing games.\nWhile it definitely looks awesome, having the trackpad directly over the graphics card means it gets hot \u2013 extremely hot. In fact, the entire Triton gets so hot under load it's uncomfortable to touch. It does an admirable job moving heat from both the CPU and GPU, with the included monitoring software showing temperatures in the upper seventies. But all that heat sticks around the body of the laptop itself.\nIt's not an exaggeration to say we feel uncomfortable handling it when it is running at full capacity.\nAll that heat is moved admirably away from the delicate processors with some pretty loud fans. Watching a movie or playing a loud game at full volume drowns out the fans, but for something like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, where hearing footsteps is crucial to winning, you're going to want to wear a set of headphones.\nThe keyboard is phenomenal. Not only does it look great, with dynamic RGB themes rendered bright and colorful, it also feels great. It's one of the best-feeling laptop keyboards we've ever tested. Each key has an incredibly satisfying click to it, and the click itself borders on ASMR.\nPlaying PUBG with the keyboard is an absolute joy, and any game with a WASD control scheme will benefit from being played on the Triton 700. If there's one complaint, it's the space bar doesn't quite feel deep enough, but that's it.",

    "text": "History seems to indicate that (nearly) every time something new comes along, it is feared, fought or outright rejected dating back even to the first notion that the earth was round (See 1, 2, 3 for a few industry-specific examples). So it now seems for neuroscience and brain-based anything. I've been doing work in this area for nearly 10 years and I still hear how neuroscience is a fad and \"brain-based\" is simply the new hype.\nI don't know about you, but I don't think the human brain is going away anytime soon. So exploring and understanding how it functions (which, it turns out, is often counter-intuitive and contradictory to what we THINK) and how to leverage that understanding can be critical to our success in the classroom, the conference room and the board room.\nBrain-based, as we use the term, refers to applying neuroscience research to our ideas, our programs, essentially most of what we do at Laurie Carey Consulting. It is driven by the primary organizing principle of the brain as put forth by Evian Gordon--minimize danger and maximize reward, with minimize danger being the MUCH STRONGER default.\nBeing brain-based means paying attention to everything you think, say and do in terms of whether you are creating dangers or rewards for the brain. The challenge is that so much of what we think, say and do can be rather \"thoughtless\" (researchers estimate between 50% and 95% of our brain activity is non-conscious; see 4 and 5 for related research). There are good evolutionary reasons for this. It takes energy to think and we humans like to conserve energy to respond to threats (there's that dang primary organizing principle again). So finding ways to \"automate\" processes allows us to minimize energy consumption. It also means we can say and do things that create a trigger to others' brains that we are a danger.\nWhen was the last time someone cut you off in traffic, or jumped ahead of you in a line, or lightly challenged your idea, or left you off of a meeting invite or ... ? How did it feel to you? What did it cause you to think or say or do? Chances are, it elicited a slight (or possibly greater) negative chain reaction. This negative reaction, often referred to as a \"fight or flight\" response, further diminishes our cognitive functioning and can result in even more non-conscious reactions.\nWhat does \"coaching\" have to do with this?\nIt turns out, taking a coaching or coach-like approach can be VERY brain-friendly IF the coaching approach is a brain-based coaching approach. Just as there are many people questioning the value of neuroscience, there are MANY people calling themselves coaches. Unfortunately, many of these folks are actually providing a service that is closer to mentoring, consulting or training--and there are significant differences. A coach is supposed to let the client \"do the heavy lifting\" and it is supposed to be a client-driven relationship, meaning the client is in charge. The coach provides the \"space\" to approach goals, topics, issues, situations, whatever in a different way. It is less about what the coach knows and more about tapping into the client's ability.\nMany coaches take a directive approach, offering suggestions, hints, ideas, thoughts ... to the client. While this can be helpful in some (and I'd say the minority of) situations, it tends not to be very brain-friendly. Giving people advice or telling them what to do (even if done in a \"helpful\" way) can still trigger danger to the hyper-sensitive brain. Even the questions a coach asks can trigger danger depending on the nature, focus and type of question asked.\nThird, it means using a brain-friendly framework for connecting with others that works with--rather than against--the brain. You might be surprised at how easy it is to get it wrong (or you might just be non-conscious, wink).\nAnd finally, it takes LOTS of attention and practice. The human brain has been evolving for centuries; I've only got a decade of brain-based practice. How about you?\nJoin us in an upcoming program or event if you want to begin to develop or strengthen your brain-based coaching skills.\n\"The Neural Basis of the Dynamic Unconscious\"",

    "text": "Lebanon, Missouri has long been home to an oft-traveled trail along the edge of the Ozarks, beginning when the Wyota and Osage Indians roamed the area. During the Civil War, the trail became known as the \u201cWire Road\u201d because of the telegraph lines installed along it between St. Louis and Springfield. Then, in the late 1920s, Route 66 was born and roughly followed the same path the Indians had marked. Today the \u201ctrail\u201d is called I-44.\nThe first white settler in the area was a man named Jesse Ballew in 1820, who built a log cabin on the east side of the Gasconade River. When Laclede County was formed in 1849, the settlement of Wyota, named for the area Indians, became the county seat. Later a highly respected minister requested the name be changed to Lebanon, after his hometown of Lebanon, Tennessee. Soon, a courthouse was erected on the town square of the newly formed county seat. Early settlers were mostly hunters and farmers from Tennessee, but word soon spread about the region, its rich farmland, plentiful game, rivers, and springs, and people from the east began to migrate to the new settlement.\nIn the 1850s The Academy was built, which offered higher education to the area\u2019s students and soon became the center of the town\u2019s cultural activity.\nBy the time the Civil War began, Lebanon remained a small secluded settlement. Though Missouri declared itself as a neutral state, its population was primarily from the South and therefore sympathized with the Confederate forces.\nDuring this time, Lebanon saw division among its people, even among families. In the 1860 election, Abraham Lincoln had received only one vote. The Lebanon people obviously did not consider themselves \u201cneutral.\u201d The town was occupied by troops for the entire length of the war. Except for six months in late 1861 when the Confederates were in control, the occupation was by Union troops. When the war ended, the town worked together to rebuild the community and officially incorporated in 1867.\nWhen the railroad began its expansion west, the short-sighted town of Lebanon refused to provide land for a railroad depot. As a result, the railroad tracks were built one mile away from the existing settlement. Later the commercial area of the town moved closer to the railroad, and the original site became known as Old Town. Eventually, even the old town square disappeared. In 1882, the Lebanon Opera House opened and along with other buildings in town, helped to establish the town as a popular place to gather for meetings. Then a discovery was made in 1889 that helped to attract even more visitors to Lebanon. When water well was dug for the community, they discovered that the water had magnetic properties. The locals began to drink and bathe in the water, believing that it had healing properties.\nThe magnetic water led to the building of the Gasconade Hotel, the grandest structure ever erected in Lebanon. Having the capacity to house up to 500 guests, the hotel also provided a ballroom, restaurant, reception rooms, and a bathhouse next to the magnetic well. Sure that people would flock from all over the country to partake of the healing waters, its builders were sorely disappointed when the hotel was not successful. Soon it became and sanatorium, but that was also short-lived. Next, it was used for community events and there was talk of turning the beautiful structure into a college. However, just ten years after it was built, the Gasconade Hotel was totally destroyed by fire in October 1899.\nLebanon continued to thrive as a small community, catering to travelers along the edge of the Ozarks. But the town really saw a change when Route 66 was born in 1926. Lebanon, the largest town between Rolla and Springfield, Missouri became a major stop along the Mother Road. Quickly providing road services, one of the first motels along the highway was Camp Joy, which opened in 1927 as a tent camp at a rate of 50 cents a night. Later, cottages and a combination gas station/grocery store were added. The Spears family ran Camp Joy for 44 years in Lebanon and even named one of their daughters after the business. In 1931 Arthur T. Nelson built his 24-room hotel at the intersection of Route 66 and Missouri Highway 5. The Nelson Hotel and Dream Village soon became one of the best-known spots along Route 66 between Chicago and Los Angeles. Each room featured a private bath and kitchen facilities, renting for $2-$3 a night. Across the street from the hotel, Nelson built his \u201cDream Village,\u201d so named because the layout appeared to him in a dream. Twelve units of native Ozark stone surrounded a courtyard which featured a very special fountain. In the evenings it became the centerpiece of a light and music show. Cars would be lined up for blocks to see it. Nelsonville, as it was called by the locals, passed into history when Route 66 became I-44.\nRoute 66 in Lebanon was also was the site of some interesting restaurants. Perhaps the most unique was Andy\u2019s Street Car Grill. It was housed in an actual street car, brought in from St. Louis, and its featured dish was \u201cAndy\u2019s Famous Fried Domestic Rabbit.\u201d Alas, Andy\u2019s is long gone. Up until just recently, you could still get a great plate of home fixins from the Bell Restaurant; but, unfortunately, it too has closed.\nAnother Lebanon landmark along Route 66 is Wrink\u2019s Market, which opened in June 1950 and continued to operate up until owner, Glenn Wrinkle\u2019s death in March 2005. This was a one of kind vintage market, where you would not only see groceries, but also collectibles, dry goods, and Route 66 memorabilia. However, the main attraction was always Glenn Wrinkle himself, who could astound the Route 66 traveler with his stories covering more than a half a century along the Mother Road. Alas, the road lost yet another paragraph in its history when Mr. Wrinkle died in March 2005 and the family auctioned the contents of the store. His son briefly resurrected the market as a convenience store, but, it closed in 2009.\nLocated in south-central Missouri on the edge of the Ozarks, Lebanon straddles Interstate 44. Today this small town of some 12,000 souls, though nestled among flowering trees, cool streams, and rolling hills is growing quickly. Still though, wonderful peeks of vintage America can still be found among the thriving franchise operated strip malls and hotels.",

    "text": "After a lot of touting and teasing, YU Televentures has finally unveiled their latest mid ranger the YU Yunicorn. It was tipped to be launched on 19th of May but the launch was rescheduled to 31st May instead. The YU Yunicorn is a mid-range phone which will give a direct competition to the the phones between 15K-20K. We have been playing with the new entrant from last week and here are the answers to some really important queries about the device.\nAnswer- The YU Yunicorn looks looks quite different compared to the previous phones from YU Televentures. Front has 2.5D curve glass and a fingerprint sensor at the bottom that looks exactly the same as Mezu m3 Note. The back is made up of metal with brushed finish and has slight curve on the sides. The top and bottom of the back is made up of plastic to place the antennae bands but they are finished like metal. There are two thin shiny stripes where the aluminum back is joint with the antennae bands, which looks good, and the back also has chamfered edges that make it look even more elegant.\nIt feels very solid and heavy in hand, and looks premium for sure. But the design looks borrowed from Meizu phones, specially the front and the camera at the back.\nQuestion- Does the YU Yunicorn Have Dual SIM Slots?\nAnswer- Yes, it has a Hybrid dual SIM slot and supports nano SIM.\nQuestion- Does the YU Yunicorn Have microSD Expansion option?\nAnswer- Yes, you can insert a micro SD card up to 128GB in the SIM 2 slot.\nQuestion- Does YU Yunicorn Have Display Glass Protection?\nAnswer- It comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.\nQuestion- How is the Display of the YU Yunicorn?\nAnswer- The YU Yunicorn comes with a 5.5 inch Full HD (1920 X 1080 pixels) IPS display protected with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The display looks very subtle and clear. Colours were looking punchy and the sharpness is also perfect. Viewing angles are good but the glass is a bit reflective under bright day light.\nQuestion- Does YU Yunicorn Support Adaptive Brightness?\nAnswer- It comes with the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the YU AOS on top.\nAnswer- Yes, it has a fingerprint sensor and it is baked in the home button, and it is very quick.\nQuestion- Can Apps be moved to SD card on YU Yunicorn?\nAnswer- It does not have any bloatware pre loaded.\nAnswer- It has a good loudspeaker, it was fairly loud for a small hall or room.\nQuestion- What is the weight of the YU Yunicorn?\nAnswer- It weighs 173 grams.\nQuestion- How much storage is free on first boot?\nAnswer- 25.24 GB is free out of 32 GB on first boot.\nQuestion- How much RAM was available at user end after first boot?\nAnswer- 2.9 GB of RAM was free when we switched on the device for the first time.\nQuestion- How good is The Camera Quality of the YU Yunicorn?\nAnswer- It comes with a 13 MP camera on the back and 5 MP on the front. Primary camera performs decent in day light but as we moved to low light, it was literally suffering. It has stabilization issues, focus speed is below average and details were also not up to the mark. The front camera captures clear selfies in natural light, but it becomes difficult to get a clear selfie in artificial light. The camera is very shaky and camera UI is laggy.\nQuestion- Can it record slow motion videos?\nAnswer- Yes it can record slow motion videos.\nQuestion- Can we Play Full HD 1080p Videos on YU Yunicorn?\nQuestion- How is Battery Backup on YU Yunicorn?\nAnswer- It comes with a 4000 mAh battery, and such a juicy battery is great for any phone with such hardware configurations.

    "text": "Santa Anita, shown on March 5, has stopped its racing program in the wake of 22 horse deaths since Dec. 26.\nImagine being a car owner with tires that keep going flat. You change the windshield wipers and install new brake pads. Hey, it\u2019s safer. See? But \u2026 um \u2026 why are the tires going flat?\nYou did something, without answering or addressing the question.\nThat\u2019s the alarming lack of dot-connecting happening at Santa Anita Park in the wake of yet another horse death at the track. The facility in Arcadia, reeling from 22 fatalities since Dec. 26 \u2014 including one Thursday, a day after re-opening the main track for training \u2014 came across as a flailing misdirection.\nThe decision to, among other things, ban the use of the medication Lasix sent trainers and those who care for horses into outraged orbit.\nThe dominoes, crushing and possibly permanent.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to cause a mass exodus from California,\u201d trainer Joe Herrick said. \u201cLasix has nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to do with the soundness of a horse. If they want to really do something, cut anti-inflammatories in half or altogether so when a vet diagnoses a horse in the morning, they really know what\u2019s happening. I look OK when I have three or four Advil. If I don\u2019t, I limp around pretty good.\nLasix is a potent diuretic that controls pulmonary bleeding in horses prone to that. If all of it sounds too inside-baseball, boil it down to this: Santa Anita had to do something to address far too many horse deaths, but picked the wrong something. In fact, they picked the exact something that could tear apart the sport at its California seams.\nIf any of this sounds like an argument in support of the sport soft-shoeing its approach to safety, that\u2019s nowhere close to being the case. In fact, nothing is more important to its financial and moral survival.\nIt\u2019s a matter of being smart and, as much as anything, on-target about decisions that send ripples through an industry already on fragile footing with an aging fan base, animal-safety concerns and a range of other challenges. Racing supports an estimated 50,000 jobs and $2.5 billion in annual economic impact in California alone.\nCarlsbad horse owner and handicapper Jon Lindo reinforced Santa Anita\u2019s confusing response.\n\u201cThe announcement they made, it\u2019s completely separate from the breakdown problem they\u2019ve been having up there,\u201d said Lindo, whose horse Skye Diamonds ran twice in the prestigious Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly & Mare Sprint. \u201cTo me, this statement has nothing else to do with what\u2019s going on at Santa Anita.\nTo Santa Anita\u2019s credit, doing something almost always trumps doing nothing. The Stronach Group, which operates the track, made the remarkable step to stop races and training in an effort to identify what was claiming so many horses. Soggy conditions also have turned Southern California into Seattle South, wreaking havoc on racing surfaces.\nWhen answers related to the track itself proved elusive, though, the announced changes came across as throwing as much against the wall as possible \u2014 hoping and praying something would stick.\nIn 2016, Del Mar suffered through 23 horse deaths at its summer and fall meets. A range of surface-specific salves included hiring renowned track superintendent Dennis Moore, increasing the amount of veterinarians and checks, cutting a week from the schedule to increase track prep time and much more that turned the tide.\nThe fatalities in the summer meet dropped from 17 to an average of 5.5 the next two years, while fall deaths tumbled from six to three to one.\nA news release from Santa Anita included a quote from Del Mar CEO Joe Harper. Though he supports Santa Anita\u2019s ban on riding crops for any use other than safety-related race correction and the other suggested steps, Harper stopped short of saying his track would ban Lasix.\nThat move in particular, Harper realizes, has the potential to cause the most damage inside the sport.\nSanta Anita also faces uncomfortable timing. The track is scheduled to host the Breeders\u2019 Cup in November. If the Kentucky Derby is horse racing\u2019s Super Bowl, the Breeders\u2019 Cup represents its World Series.\nThe dark cloud of unsafe racing has the potential to rattle the confidence of decision-makers for the event, which delivered a reported $97 million in economic impact to Del Mar in 2017.\nSomething had to be done at Santa Anita. They\u2019re no closer, though, to solving why horses keep falling on their track. To make matters worse, they\u2019ve enraged many of the stakeholders critical to addressing the issue.\nNew wiper blades and brake pads are nice.\nBetter yet: Fix the car \u2014 or don\u2019t drive it until you do.",

    "text": "kwschumm, m610 and ejota like this.\nOne of the things I like best about Opels is that the headlights are manually operated. Chunk-Chunk.\nI don't really get automated hood openers. First, how often is one opening hoods, to necessitate this? Second, how difficult is it to open a hood? If one is able to drive. Automatic windows, locks, etc, because those are done while driving or approaching the vehicle or leaving the vehicle and take time. But automated hood opening? I'm already stuck there doing whatever I opened the hood to do. Third, it's slower. If It was like a mousetrap, BANG and the hood is popped open, okay, now you've got my attention.\nThat said, I will always be in favor of robotic slavery. Makes me feel like an emperor. \"Minion! Open my hood!\" And the robot slave runs on its hamster wheel to crank it open. Automation is awesome.\nOne reason is that it's a car show thing to show off. Another is the enjoyment of the challenge of doing it, much like your project. I and a number of others do ridiculous mods just for the sake of doing them.\nDoes anyone have that video of that powered pop-out rear side window mod that someone did?\nI think they were air actuated, but maybe they used servos.\nV8GT and m610 like this.\nwayne tormans purple GTthat drinkman owns now. there is a write up out there somewhere.\nHere is a short description of the elec. hood mod.\nA little more complicated is the electric unlocking mechanism for the hood, which is strictly necessary. I use a small actuator from a BMW E46 Coupe (rear vent window).\nAs a backup, it is always still possible to open(and close) the hood manually by hand. I manage this by decoupling the actutors mecanical in direction open.\nOn this two pics (3 & 4) it is visible how it works. A bearing slides on a additional rod, which is attached in front of the actuator. The rod is of course a little bit longer than the actuator stroke.\nthat back in the days Opel itself converted two GT with a electical hood to display on car shows in 1968. Both cars were also equipped with a slow runing automatic headlight device.\nLast edited by V8GT; 1 Week Ago at 03:27 AM.\nG.v.Mainberg, clarkey, SpringGT and 3 others like this.\nOkay Jose, you are now going to have to show us a lot more pictures of the cool stuff on your car. I see a burled walnut instrument panel cover and a VERY nice cover under the dash where your switch is. What other cool things are hiding from us?\nI like your idea of one linear actuator going to a rod that goes through both hood hinges. Very strong and balanced.\nI do not understand how you can open the hood by hand. Do you have to disconnect the linear actuator? Will the actuator let you lift the hood when it has no power? If your battery dies, can you still open the hood?\nI was asked to post more about our rear windows. Here is a post I've done in the past. Sorry, no video. I'll see if I can get one this weekend.\nLifes too short to drive boring cars or drink boring beers. Just don't do them at the same time.\n1979 Triumph Spitfire with GT6+ conversion = \"Spit6\"\nDo you have to disconnect the linear actuator?\nI might be wrong, but what I think is happening is that the actuator can push (lengthen) against the bearing in Pic 4 and open the hood, but, if it stays closed (short), you can still pull it open manually (Pic 3). In the manual case, rather than the actuator lengthening, the whole shortened actuator just slides back because it's not secured at the bottom end. It's floating. That is, gravity closes the hood when the actuator lets it, there is no pulling constraint, only pushing.\nIf you look at Pic 3, see the space between the end of the actuator and the start of the bearing (follow down the skinny shaft)... if that was in electric mode, you wouldn't see the rod between the actuator and the bearing, the actuator itself would have pushed out that far and be butted against the bearing (like in pic 4, where the actuator shaft is 3x as thick as the skinny shaft). It's like a telescoping tube. The inner tube is the steel bar, the outer tube is the actuator.\nOr I'm out to lunch.\nLast edited by MattsAwesomeStuff; 1 Week Ago at 03:03 PM.\nYeah that would make sense.\nI work with linear actuators at work, but ours are air driven, so they're powered by air pressure in both directions. They don't budge if you try to move them at either end of their stroke. But if you bleed off the air pressure you can easily slide them back and forth.\nmost people dont understand that \u201edecoupling-thing\u201c.\nThe actuator is permanent in \u201edirection open\u201c disconnected. Matts get it and describes exactly how it works in post #10.\nThe BMW actuator which unlocks(and locks) the hood latch, works the same way.\nThe pic\u00b4s shows the telescoping linkage.\nThe linkage(hood latch) is pulled back from the original hood latch spring.\nThe hood closes only through gravity.\nI have to note that this hood is little bit heavier due to sound damping mats. Ist not that much but what counts is lever arm and this one is very long.\nTo be honest, i was able to identify the GT-Showcar from the 69 Brussel Motorshow and i know the VIN . I am really not kidding.\nThe other one(last pic in post #5) was a GT 1100. Both were pre production cars.\nthey're powered by air pressure in both directions. They don't budge if you try to move them at either end of their stroke.\nI think these are screw-type, (probably double-stage planetary with a pair of spur gears at the bottom). Regardless, same should apply to them here.\nI'm probably not explaining it right.\nI think what you mistakenly think is happening is that the actuator - when unpowered - allows the ram to slide freely. I don't think it does. The ram length still stays short.\nWhat is actually happening is that the locked-short RAM has nothing securing the bottom end of the ram from moving, only the top end. So you can overextend it manually. It's only designed to forcibly push.\nThat would mean the bottom end of the ram can just flop about in any direction like a wang in the wind, so you need a thing that makes sure it settles back into the same position against the bumper when the hood is manually closed every. That thing is a much smaller rod that constrains the bottom of the actuator to be always pointing at the bearing. Like, umm, a catheter I suppose. This is a terrible analogy, I'm not comfortable talking about it anymore. Hopefully you understand now.\nYou have described it correct.\nI manufactured and added the small sliding-rod-extention to the actuator. They dont come from factory with such an \"wackadoodle-option\" when you buy them.\nLast edited by V8GT; 1 Week Ago at 08:10 PM.\nOr maybe even more interesting would be how did Opel do this mod back in 1968/69?\nAre there pictures of one of those cars showing the mod?\nUnfortunately i dont know if there exist pic\u00b4s from this devices. Keep in mind that this modifications happend now 50 years ago. I gues most people who were involved in this, sadly dont live any more.\nLater i will post some pics from my under dash panel make of.\nYes, this is exact like mine looks. It comes from Lenk.\nAs promised, here are some pics from my foot room panel(under dash cover) fabrication.\nAfter the EPS install some years ago, i decide to cover that stuff with a foot panel.\nFinally i opted for a 2 piece design. I made the right side from thin sheet metal. The left side ist a wooden-metal mix.\nBefore cover them up with leather, i \u201esoften\u201c the surface with a layer of foam.\nThis is verry important from seafty reasons in case of an haevy accident(car crash).\nThe left side has a cutout for access to the fuse box. The cutout is covered withe the original Opel GT fuse cover.\nLater i added a foot room illumination and a \u201ehead light-on - ignition-off - door-open\u201c buzzer.\nI prefer the BMW one because it sounds not that harsh.\nThe illlumination is conected to a adjustable delay modul withe dimmer function.\nIt also controls the main interior lights. Ligths in plural because i added a second one on left side b pilar.\nThe swich for the motorisiered hood come from a Mercedes W124(elec. sliding roof).\nThe little \u201eswitch-console\u201c on the transmission tunel , whith in reality is the heater foot room air duct.\nIn my case it hosted the EPS controls and other \u201eunder dash switches\u201c.\nOver the years i updated this little piece several times. Pic 9 & 10 shows the last version.\nSpringGT, kwschumm, slracer and 2 others like this.",

The Boston Braves (the current Washington Redskins) joined the NFL before the season, whereas the loss of the Providence Steam Roller, Cleveland Indians and Frankford Yellow Jackets dropped league membership to eight teams, the lowest in NFL history; the league also had eight teams in 1943 due to World War II.\nAlthough the Green Bay Packers finished the season with 10 wins, the league title was determined at the time by winning percentage with ties excluded, so the Portsmouth Spartans and the Chicago Bears finished the season tied for first place (6\u20131). Since both games between the teams ended in ties, the NFL arranged for the first ever playoff game to determine the NFL champion.\nExtremely cold weather forced the game to be moved from Wrigley Field to the indoor Chicago Stadium. The makeshift football field in the stadium was only 80 yards long with undersized endzones, forcing officials to move the goal posts to the goal line due to a lack of space to put them at the back of the end zone, as was standard in college and professional football. This change was favored by players and fans, and the goal posts were moved to the goal line as one of several rule changes the league made in 1933, with the rule lasting until 1973.\nThe Bears won the playoff game 9\u20130, which was scoreless until the fourth quarter, and as the game counted in the final standings, the Spartans finished in third place. The Spartans became the Detroit Lions in 1934.\nBecause the Portsmouth Spartans and the Chicago Bears finished the season tied for first place, a playoff game was held to determine the NFL champion.\nThe league decreased to eight teams in 1932.\nFollowing the 1932 season, the NFL would be split into two divisions (later two conferences), with the champions of each meeting in a championship game.\nThis was the result of the end of the 1932 season, where there was a tie for first in the standings at the end of the regular season: as tied games did not count until 1972, the Spartans record of 6\u20131\u20134 and the Bears record of 6\u20131\u20136 were taken to be six wins, one loss, giving both an .857 win percentage.\nHad pure win-loss differential or the current (post-1972) system of counting ties as half a win, half a loss been in place in 1932, the Packers' record of 10\u20133\u20131 (.750, +7) would have won them a fourth consecutive championship, ahead of the Spartans' 6\u20131\u20134 (.727, +5) and the Bears' 6\u20131\u20136 (.692, +5).\nThe Green Bay Packers were unbeaten (8\u20130\u20131) after nine games, and after the Thanksgiving weekend, their 10\u20131\u20131 record (.909) was still well ahead of Portsmouth at 5\u20131\u20134 (.833) and Chicago at 4\u20131\u20136 (.800).\nIn Week Twelve (December 4), the Spartans handed the Packers a 19\u20130 defeat, while the Bears beat the Giants 6\u20130. Portsmouth, at 6\u20131\u20134 (.857), took the lead, while the Packers (10\u20132\u20131) and the Bears (5\u20131\u20136) were tied for second (.833).\nIn Week Thirteen, the Bears hosted the Packers; a Green Bay win would have the Packers finish second with an 11\u20132\u20131 record (.846) and hand Portsmouth their first ever title. The Bears beat the Packers 9\u20130, meaning they finished 6\u20131\u20136, and tied for first in the standings with Portsmouth.\nThough it was described as a \"playoff\", the Bears 9\u20130 win over Portsmouth on December 18 counted in the regular season standings. As such, the Bears finished at 7\u20131\u20136 (.875) and won the 1932 title, with the Packers runners-up, and the Spartans, at 6\u20132\u20134 (.750), finished third.\nKenneth \"Ken\" R. Wendt (January 29, 1910 \u2013 January 19, 1982) was an American football player, jurist, and politician.\nWendt was a guard for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League in 1932. He then served in the Illinois General Assembly and as a judge in Cook County, Illinois.\nThe National Football League champions, prior to the merger between the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) in 1970, were determined by two different systems. The National Football League was established on September 17, 1920, as the American Professional Football Association (APFA). The APFA changed its name in 1922 to the National Football League, which it has retained ever since.From 1921 to 1931, the APFA/NFL determined its champion by overall win\u2013loss record, with no playoff games; ties were not counted in the winning percentage total. The APFA did not keep records of the 1920 season; they declared the Akron Pros, who finished the season with an 8\u20130\u20133 (8 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties) record, as the league's first champions, by a vote of the owners, with the Buffalo-All Americans and Decatur Staleys also claiming the title. According to modern-tie breaking rules, the Buffalo All-Americans tied Akron for the championship. The Canton Bulldogs won two straight championships from 1922 to 1923, and the Green Bay Packers won three in a row from 1929 to 1931.There also has been controversy over the championshipships of the 1921 APFA season and the 1925 NFL season, with the Buffalo All-Americans laying claim to another championship in an incident known as the \"Staley Swindle\" and the Pottsville Maroons being stripped of their championship in 1925 for playing an exhibition game against college football powerhouse Notre Dame's famed Four Horsemen, leading to a last minute field goal victory for the Maroons, stunning the crowd and nation, and also put the NFL ahead of college football for the first time ever. These three disputed championships contributed to the beginning of the NFL's rich history.\nThe 1932 NFL season resulted in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, and could not be resolved by the typical win\u2013loss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game in each of the four seasons before the completed merger. The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.The Green Bay Packers won the most NFL championships before the merger, winning eleven of the fifty championships. The Packers were also the only team to win three straight championships, an achievement they accomplished twice: from 1929\u201331 and from 1965\u201367. The Chicago Bears won a total of eight titles, and the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and New York Giants each won four. The Bears recorded the largest victory in a championship game, defeating the Washington Redskins 73\u20130 in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; six other title games ended in a shutout as well. The Philadelphia Eagles recorded two consecutive shutouts in 1948 and 1949. New York City hosted the most championship games (eight), while the highest-attended title game was the 1955 NFL Championship Game, where 85,693 fans showed up in Los Angeles to watch the Browns beat the Rams 38\u201314.\nStaten Island () is one of the five boroughs of New York City, in the U.S. state of New York. Located in the southwest portion of the city, the borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With an estimated population of 479,458 in 2017, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in land area at 58.5 sq mi (152 km2). The borough also contains the southern-most point in the state, South Point.\nThe borough is coextensive with Richmond County and until 1975 was referred to as the Borough of Richmond. Staten Island has sometimes been called \"the forgotten borough\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government.The North Shore\u2014especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton and Stapleton\u2014is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the 2.5-mile (4 km) F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest boardwalk in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island.",

    "text": "Investor sentiment measures may be used as contrarian indicators. We expect the market to do the opposite of what the indicators are saying when they reach an extreme level of bullish/greed/optimism or bearish/fear/pessimism. Identifying extreme levels of positive or negative sentiment may give us an indicator of the direction the stock market is likely to trend next.\nI observe when sentiment reaches overly optimistic levels like it did late 2017 into January 2018, the stock market trend trends down or at least sideways afterward. In reverse, after investor sentiment becomes extremely pessimistic, the stock market tends to trend back up.\nAlthough extreme investor sentiment may be used as a contrarian indicator, I do not base my investment or tactical trading decisions on it by itself. I use investor sentiment measures and indicators to indicate and confirm my other signals of a potential trend change. For example, when bullish investor sentiment is rising from a lower level but not yet reached an extreme high, it\u2019s just confirming trend following. However, when bullish sentiment reaches an extreme it warns me to be prepared for a potential countertrend. All those who want to buy may have bought, so buying enthusiasm may be exhausted. That\u2019s what I observed in January 2018. After prices fall investor sentiment shifts to bearish and they fear more loss. Once the level of fear reaches an extreme it begins to suggest those who want to sell have sold and we could see selling become exhausted and a selling climax.\nWe have two types of investor sentiment measures: Polls and indicators.\nThe results are then consolidated into the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which offers us some insight into the mood of individual investors.\nBearish investor sentiment is negatively correlated with stock market index returns. Below I created a chart of the S&P 500 stock index with an overlay of the % bearish investor sentiment. On the bottom, I added the correlation between the S&P 500 and the % bearish investor sentiment. We can visually see there is a negative correlation between investors getting more bearish as stock prices fall. For example, few investors were bearish in 2014 into 2015 until the stock index fell -12% in August 2015, then the % of bearish investors spiked up. We also saw the % of bearish investors extremely low in January 2018 as the stock index reached an all-time high. After the stock index declined -20% at the end of 2018 we saw the % of bearish investors spike up again. As we enter 2019, the % of bearish investors is at a historical extreme high level so we may be observing a selling climax as the desire to sell gets exhausted.\nBullish investor sentiment is positively correlated with stock index returns, except after stock prices fall, then investors lose their optimism. In the chart below, we see the % of bullish investors trending up along with stocks 2014 into 2015, but then as prices fell late 2015 into 2016 they lose their optimism for stocks. We saw another spike to an extreme level of bullishness late 2017 into 2018 as the stock index reached all-time highs. The % of bullish investors declined with great momentum after prices fell sharply. As we enter 2019, the % of bullish investors is very low, leaving much room for the desire to buy to take over.\nInvestor sentiment surveys like AAII are useful tools to get an idea of extreme sentiment levels when selling pressure or buying enthusiasm may be becoming exhausted. However, their potential weakness is they are ultimately just polls asking people what they believe, not what they are actually doing. Regardless, they do seem to have enough accuracy to be used as a guide to confirm other indicators.\nAs I\u2019ve observed extreme levels of investor sentiment and participation in the 2018 downtrend in global markets, I\u2019ve shared these indicators several times. As we saw in the investor sentiment survey, the VIX spiked in 2015, then spiked again but to a lower high in 2016 as the stock index fell. The VIX spiked again in February 2018 as the S&P 500 quickly declined -10%. After prices trended back up implied volatility contracted all the way to the low level of 12. The stock index started to decline again, so the VIX once again indicated a volatility expansion. As we enter 2019, the CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index VIX is at 25.42, just over its long-term average of 20. The VIX implies an expected volatility range of 25% over the next 30 days.\nI\u2019ve shared several observations the past few months of the Put/Call Ratio. The Put/Call Ratio is a range bound indicator that swings above and below 1, so reveals a shifting preference between put volume to call volume. When the level is high, it indicates high put volume. Since puts are used for hedging or bearish trades, I consider it a contrary indicator at extremely high levels.\nThe Equity Put/Call Ratio measures the put and call volume on equities, leaving out indexes. The Equity Put/Call Ratio spiked to a high level of put volume when it reached 1.13 on December 21, 2018, as the stock index was declining. The high Equity Put/Call indicated options trading volume was much higher for protective puts than call volume. The Equity Put/Call Ratio is considered to be mostly non-professional traders who tend to be more bullish, so it keeps call volume relatively high and the ratio low. Its high level has so far turned out to be a reliable short-term indicator of a short-term low in stocks. As we enter 2019, the Equity Put/Call Ratio is at .60, which is at a normal range. We normally see more call volume than put volume in the Equity Put/Call Ratio, so the ratio is its normal level as you can see in the chart.\nThe CBOE Index Put/Call Ratio is applied to index options without equity options. We believe professional traders and portfolio managers mostly use index options for hedging or directional positions. The total volume of the Index Put/Call Ratio is asymmetric toward puts for hedging purposes. As we can observe in the chart below, the current level at the beginning of 2019 is 1.09 dropping about 35% from it\u2019s December peak at 1.67.\nWe can visually see the tendency in Index Put/Call is around 1 as the Equity Put/Call Ratio is around 0.60. Equity Put/Call Ratio has a more optimistic/bullish tendency as individual stock options are used more for bullish bets as index options are used more as for hedging.\nThe CBOE Total Put/Call Ratio combines both equity and index options to create a range bound oscillator that swings above and below 1. With the Total Put/Call Ratio, I believe the put bias in index options is offset by the call bias in equity options. The Total Put/Call Ratio spiked to its highest ever reading of 1.82 on December 20, 2018, as the stock index was entering the -20% \u201cbear market\u201d level. I consider a level above 1.20 to be bullish as it indicates an extreme in put volume over call volume. A reading below 0.70 is more bearish since there is an asymmetry between call volume over put volume. Above 1.20 is an elevated put trading volume. As a bet that stock prices will fall or hedge against them, buying put options is a bearish sentiment. Of course, some of the volume could have been traders selling puts which are a very speculative bullish bet, but since I pointed it out the stock indexes reversed up sharply, so I believe it turned out to be a reliable short-term indicator of a short-term low in stocks. As we enter 2019, the Total Put/Call Ratio is at .98 which is still high. We usually see more call volume than put volume, so the ratio is typically well below 1 as you can see in the chart.\nThere is no better indicator of a shift in investor sentiment than price action. No one believes that any more than me. The direction of the price trend is the final arbiter, and I\u2019ve believed it over two decades. Any indicator that is a derivative of price or non-price trend economic data has the potential to stray far from the reality of the price trend. The price trend determines the value and the outcome of a position. As we enter 2019, the S&P 500 stock index has declined -20% off it\u2019s September high and after a sharp reversal up since December 24th, it\u2019s currently in a short-term downtrend, but at a level, the countertrend back up may continue.\nEven if you don\u2019t observe investor sentiment measures as an indicator or trade signal, it\u2019s still useful to observe the extremes to help avoid becoming overly bullish or overly bearish and part of the herd. The herd tends to be wrong at extremes, and most investors tend to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. If I am to create better results, I must necessarily do the opposite of most investors.\nAs a tactical investment manager, I identify changes in price trends, inter-market relationships, investor sentiment, and market conditions aiming for better risk-adjusted returns. My objective is asymmetric investment returns, so I necessarily focus on asymmetric risk/reward positions, and that includes focusing on asymmetries between bullish and bearish investor sentiment.",

    "text": "If for some reason wild baby mice have been placed in your care, I have included a few tips on caring and feeding to help you give them a chance at life. Please be aware that even in the wild, mice have a 50% chance of surviving beyond 5 months of age, given a normal upbringing. The mice that do make it can live up to around 5 years if healthy. A pair will have a better chance of survival than a lone mouse.\nAs soon as you have your baby mice, it is important to keep them safe and warm. You can use a small pet carrier, large plastic tub or any other suitable box in which you can put them. Layer the bottom with a towel and place the mice on top. Then, use another soft material to lightly cover the mice like fleece. Place the box in a warm place, ensuring that it is not hot; otherwise the mice will become dehydrated. A heater on the lowest setting may be all that is needed. Test the towel the mice are laying on so that it feels cosy and warm to your hand.\nIf the baby mice are less than 14 days old they will need dropper fed with a milk substitute until they are weaned. They usually open their eyes when they are just about weaned and able to eat by themselves. You will need to feed them every 2 hours so be prepared to get up during the night. Set your alarm. When I was looking after wild mice, I was getting up every 2 hours to check them. I have since read that during the night mother mouse would be away looking for food and may only return to the nest once to feed her babies. Use common sense, if you can manage a few night feeds, all the best for the babies chance of survival, especially in the early days.\nKitten milk is available to buy at pet shops. I used raw coconut blended up and strained. It should be 1 cup coconut to about 2 and \u00bd cups water. You could also use soaked almonds to make an almond milk using the same ratios. Make sure the nuts are natural and plain. Once you've made up the milk, store in a sterilised glass jar and keep in the fridge until required. When you go to feed the mice, take a quarter a cup of the milk and warm it up by pouring it in a small jug and standing in hot water. Use a dropper or baby syringe (you can get these at the chemist) to feed 1 or 2 drops of the milk at a time into the baby mouse mouth. When the mice are really young, they might not open their mouth. Be careful not to get the milk up their noses, they will splutter / cough if you do. It can be dangerous for their health if you do. The way I fed the mice was to put a facecloth down on a table and to put one mouse at a time onto it. Then you can gently hold the baby's head whilst you administer the milk with the dropper. You'll get the hang of it with a bit of practise. The baby might not seem to be taking much milk, do not worry. Very young babies may only need to get a drop or 2 on their mouth / tongues until they can take more. The main purpose here is to keep them hydrated with a little drop at a time every couple of hours.\nOnce the baby is fed, you need to stimulate a bowel movement. To do this, put some warm water in a small bowl and dip a cotton bud into it. Then, put the cotton bud between the baby's back legs and gently turn the bud around. You should see a little brown staining, that is their poo. Dip the other end of the bud into the water and gently stroke the baby's body, this emulates the mother licking them. After all that, tuck baby up in it's soft bedding and place in a warm spot. This is the basic routine that needs to be repeated every couple of hours during the day and at least 2-3 times during the night, especially around 1am and 5am.\nAs you can see, it's quite a commitment, looking after baby wild mice. But, there is also a great reward in the caring of them and the bonding you will feel as a carer.\nWhen the babies start to open their eyes or at least take a peak, they may be taking a lot more milk and starting to walk around a little. This is when you need to be extra careful; one fall is enough to be fatal. You can make a little safe roaming area in the bottom part of a pet cage or shoebox / basin. Line it with newspaper and leaves to simulate a natural environment. The youngsters will enjoy stretching their legs and taking their first steps. This is important, as it will build up their muscles and strength.\nOnce the babies start to bite your fingers quite firmly when you feed them, they may be ready for a little solid food. They will also be starting to open their eyes (12-14 days old) Start very slowly with this. Try some baby fruit puree to start or natural rice pudding. The food should not be chilled. Let them lick it off your finger. Avoid putting the purees onto a dish for the mice to feed from, as they might get messy and end up with matted fur, which needs to be avoided. Some other foods to graduate to are porridge, banana, tomato, dried oat flakes, strawberry. Just go real easy with the food and keep it simple and easily digested to start with. Congratulations! You've actually made it to the weaning stage, which is quite something with wild baby mice.\nContinue to provide a safe space for the mice to sleep and once weaned, they will be able to come out at night to feed. Give them a little dish near their bed so they can feed during the night. At least you can get some sleep now! Continue to offer the milk during the day and provide some water for them. Usually, wild mice will still have some mothers milk up to about 4 weeks of age.\nNow you have to decide whether to keep them or release into the wild. I do not know how many mice have been successfully hand-reared and released into the wild. I would think it unlikely that they can survive. However, you've done your bit and if they seem strong and healthy and quite active, it might be possible to release them. Or, you can keep them as pets.\nFinally, if you did your best and the mice died, do not feel bad. Survival chances in the best of conditions ie with their natural mother are still low. Just enjoy the experience you've had with them and the opportunity to get a glimpse into their little lives. They are little bundles of love and it is wonderful to have at least given them some love when otherwise they might have perished.",

    "text": "\u201cTrue\u201d Story: Stem Cell Therapy Helps an Old Friend Stay Young.\nOne of the best things about being a veterinarian is being able to meet some very interesting animals. Much like people, animals have their own individual personalities: some are gregarious, some are more reserved, some are friendly and some not so much. My favorite dogs are those with a certain nobility in their demeanor, a savoir faire if you will; they are confident, friendly, and trusting.\n\u201cTrue\u201d is a dog with such a personality and in addition is a renown hunter on the farm. He keeps the farm clear of unsavory characters such as raccoons, groundhogs, and other undesirables. Unfortunately, his long and active life has left him with chronic arthritis and he was slowing down visibly when I first examined him. He had the typical radiographic changes that we see in older dogs and I knew he was suffering from chronic pain in spite of his stoic personality.\nFortunately for True, he has a loving and observant owner. She was also aware of his problems and agreed to give stem cell therapy a chance. That was three years ago and I am delighted to report that True is still going strong. Even at age 13 he is a relentless hunter and still goes on long walks with his owner. There is no question that the treatments have vastly improved his quality of life.\nI get a great deal out of my visits with True and a great deal of satisfaction in knowing that we are helping this noble animal in his older years.\nGreen Tree Animal Hospital would like to announce that beginning August 8 we will be open Wednesday evenings now until 7:00 pm to help serve you better. We know everyone has hectic work schedules so we are hoping that this will help many of you get the appointments needed. Please call our office at 859-223-2221 to set up an appointment or with any questions.\n\u00a9 2019 Green Tree Animal Hospital Lexington, Kentucky.",

    "text": "The proliferation of mobile devices in the last decade has been enormous. Even more recently, smart phones have become commonplace in almost every person\u2019s pocket or bag, and mobile pad devices are becoming more commonly used, in some cases, replacing the laptop and to become an expected item to be found in almost every person\u2019s bag of accessories within five years. This change in the types of devices that we commonly use to socialise, work and function also has its effect on SEO. While SEO for mobile devices shares a lot of its character with that of traditional SEO for PCs and laptops, there are distinctions to note and strategies to be mindful of for mobile that can allow for a much more effective mobile campaign that generates increased enquiries and sales. To miss out on these opportunities could be perilous as the future of search heads more and more to the realm of mobile, as its use continues to dramatically rise.\nA principle that is important to abide by when SEO is concerned is that SEO is for users. The people that think from this perspective tend to produce high quality work that stands the test of time and work that offers value to a global public and brand campaign in more ways than one. The people that think from the perspective that SEO is for machines, resultantly tend to produce spam. An important concept that we at Elite SEO cannot reiterate enough to our clients is that Google\u2019s robots seek to emulate human users. Search engines want to take users to sites that are useful and valuable for humans. And due to this, their algorithm is consistently refined to better ensure that this is the case. This algorithm, in an oversimplified explanation, looks to mimic what humans would deem to be good sites as results to search queries made, and lists these results accordingly.\nA website that is mobile friendly most significantly means that your users will have a more enriching user experience when browsing your website on mobile. A website that adapts to fit the screen of a mobile offers a better mobile experience. This leads to a better brand impression and leads to a higher probability of enquiries and sales from mobile-viewers. A site that is suitable for a mobile is site that is either a responsive website or a designated mobile website. A responsive site is one that is liquid and that moves to adjust to the resolution of the computer it is being viewed on. A mobile website is one that is made specifically for mobile devices, with a different URL to that of a brand\u2019s main, non-mobile website, and a website that can be remotely different from a website developed for a desktop or laptop. Both forms, whether a responsive design or mobile-designated site enable a user to view a website effectively on a mobile device and can thereby maximise the mobile viewing and interactive experience. The form of a website is one of the most important elements to have right for mobile, even before getting to work on other SEO elements. Ensure that the site looks good on a mobile device, and look to test its appearance and functionality for phones and mobile pad devices.\nPeople who use mobile are usually time-poor. They are on the run to their next appointment, are quickly looking for a place to acquire the product or service they need or require a piece of information or fact check to contribute effectively to a conversation or important meeting discussion. Additionally, internet connection to mobile devices invariably tends to be slower than that to desktop or laptop computer devices. For these reasons, when it comes to using mobile devices to search, time is of the essence. Creating a mobile website that appears rapidly without delays is part of a good mobile web experience, but in addition, will help your SEO. Google wants to take users to websites that offer a good mobile experience, a trend that will only continue to grow, particularly in the field of mobile SEO. The load speed of a website is a crucial factor for the performance of a website and its search. A good mobile site will look to ensure a rapid load time by ensuring a design layout that is efficiently loaded yet visibly appealing and will seek to optimise images where possible to reduce load time.\nWhen people view sites on their mobile devices, they are generally up, about and exploring. Many mobile users are looking for their next meal or what to do for the day in the locality they are at. Mobile users want to find suitable businesses that can provide the ideal product or service they are wanting. A good mobile site should have effective information, with key information made distinctly visible. All phone numbers should be made to be click-to-call so users can easily make contact with the businesses that interests them. Much like SEO for traditional devices, good content that offers rich information that is valuable is also important. Articles that offer handy advice or deep insight are great for people that are commuting from home to work, or need a good read while on their break and sitting on a park bench. This also leads to the need for content to be shareable. Mobile users are highly social, often interacting on social media through their mobile devices throughout their day. Making social sharing easy for them through the form of social sharing buttons will allow them to rapidly share content on your website, which will allow more people to be exposed to your brand and will enable for better SEO performance.\nIn a recent survey by Our Mobile Planet, it was revealed that 94% of smart phone users had used their device to find local information. 84% had taken action after making a search. In a similar survey, it was uncovered that 63% of people take action within an hour of making a mobile search, while 84% do so within 5 hours. Mobile users making searches tend to be different from laptop and computer users in that they are more readily looking for local information and are positioned to quickly act. What then does this mean for mobile SEO? Firstly, and most basically, mobile users need to be able to find you. Having your address on your mobile site is a good start. This address should link to a Google Map or alternatively, a Google Map should be provided and made clearly visible on your mobile website. This is particularly important if you are a local business selling a product or service with a storefront and you want to increase traffic to your store (e.g. restaurant, shop & hairdresser). Research conducted by Bryson Meunier at Resolution Media reveals that searches for ATM location (99 percent), restaurants (88 percent), bars (97 percent) most commonly come from mobile devices. The second important element is to understand and anticipate what mobile searches are searching for when it comes to finding your product or service. It may be that there are users typing \u201ccheap pizza in Sydney\u201d or \u201c24 hour coffee in Melbourne\u201d, which then aligns with what your business offers. Google\u2019s keyword tool can be used to find these types of keywords people may be entering. Creating designated pages for these keywords will enable a business to capture more traffic from mobile users, both online but then more importantly offline, and can then effectively boost the sales of a business.\nThere are many mobile functions that a mobile website can also possess to help or engage a user to have a better experience of your brand. These functions are exclusive to mobile devices and can therefore be leveraged upon when it comes to developing websites that cater to mobile users. A full list of all these functions will be elaborately described in a blog post to come. A great functioning mobile website will not only service users well, but will draw people to naturally link to the site and share it on social media, encouraging other users to experience what it has to offer. This will inevitably will improve SEO and generate more visitors to check out your brand.\nThese elements when implemented well on a mobile site will contribute significantly to appealing and engaging a growing audience that searches for and views websites on mobile devices. This is proving to be a great way to gain business but also to invest into the future as more and more activity transfers from traditional computer devices to that of mobile.",

The crowds in the streets? The viewing parties in apartments and bars? The social media explosion?\nFox Sports is betting World Cup fever will return as the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team takes the pitch for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup Canada 2015 on June 6. The network planned to use its telecast of the Daytona 500 today to launch a $10 million, 100-day promotional push for its first World Cup coverage.\nThe emotional ad begins with the 2-1 loss to Belgium that eliminated the men\u2019s team last July. Images include fallen goalkeeper Tim Howard, crushed fans, crowds dispersing.\nThe underdog U.S. men\u2019s team\u2019s surprise run created a \u201ccultural whirlwind\u201d last summer, noted Robert Gottlieb, Fox Sports\u2019 evp of marketing. Fox\u2019s creative strategy is to show the torch being passed from one U.S. team to the other, he said.\nNow, Fox\u2019s \u201cNothing Is Over\u201d rallying cry may sound like Rambo in First Blood, but Gottlieb and Fox \u201cbelieve very strongly\u201d the country will rally around the women\u2019s team this summer.\nSome critics will see the \u201cAmerica has a score to settle\u201d line as jingoistic. But Gottlieb says it works on several fronts. For one, the U.S. women\u2019s team hasn\u2019t won the World Cup since 1999, when Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain became household names. Despite ranking as the national team\u2019s all-time leading scorer, Wambach has never won a World Cup. Other stars are burning to avenge their loss to Japan in the 2011 FIFA World Cup.\nThe \u201cIt\u2019s Not Over\u201d spot will kick off what Fox says will be the biggest network marketing push for a Women\u2019s World Cup. There will be more TV ads focusing on individual players such as Morgan and Wambach, according to Gottlieb. Fox is planning a 30-channel media roadblock around a 30-second version of \u201cIt\u2019s Not Over\u201d that will air Tuesday at 8 p.m.\nAs soccer gains popularity within the U.S., Simon Wardle, chief strategy officer of Octagon Worldwide, believes World Cup fever will reignite when the U.S. women\u2019s team starts play this summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few occasions where Team USA can take on the world,\u201d he said.",

Any suggestions?\nNot sure if I could deal with Win 10 (spy on me and patch when MS says) Home version though.\nhow does this compare to this one?\nI got the i7 directly from HP awhile back. It had very little bloatware on it and set up extremely easy. I took the case off to see how easy it'd be to add an HD and.... Not terribly. But I didn't really need to so it was no big deal. Pretty impressed so far.\nLooks like that Dell deal has expired.\nYou most likely can not stop the spying on you. I do not buy you are not spied on in Windows 7.\nAs to the patching when they want. Windows 10 is not nearly as bad at that as Windows 7. I have had 10 for some time now. Installed it while it was still free upgrade fairly soon after it started that. Only about twice did it install and restart when I was using it. Now you walk away and leave it on sometimes it will do that.\nI quite like Windows 10 and is seems to work better for me than 7. When you first install it it might be problematic. Seems to take up to two weeks to simmer down. I could not force my 4k to work for the first week or two when upgrading to Windows 10. After a week or a bit more I could but had to specify the 4k settings manually. Once I did that it would recognize my 4k monitor. By the way the video card is not a 4k video card. Most will work on 4k if you manually install it at 26 or 30 hz. For 60 you need the correct cable and a better card. Unfortunately most TV's do not have the best input for 4k.\nThe processor itself cost $300. So yes it is a good deal if you want a powerful desktop for gaming or something.\nMakes more sense to me to add an SSD for the Operating System. Optane Memory speeds up a hard drive but not nearly as much as an SSD. Seems to me for this price not adding an SSD would be foolish. It makes the Desktop so much faster.\nThe second one down has 24 GB of memory. At least now it does perhaps it did not originally.\nLast edited by SteveA7911 July 15, 2018 at 07:44 PM.\nNot too familiar with these small form factors. Is the power supply not the standard size? And is it even possible to throw in a short 7\" long graphics card? I have a nice 450W Corsair PSU just lying around and would like to put it in this HP as well to make it a gaming rig.\nPower supply is 310 volts and it would be difficult to replace it as the power on the MB is uncommon.\n75 Watts is the max for a Graphics board. It only has two connections for boards. One large one and a small one.\nWhen you ask them a question they do not really answer it. Their main page is almost completely useless describing the computer.\nThe Motherboard does have a M1 for a SSD. However they have nothing for a second SATA drive. The Motherboard does. So it might be possible to add one anyway. Power would require a divider for power and another SATA cable.\nLast edited by SteveA7911 July 15, 2018 at 08:05 PM.\nAny idea how the ram would come on the one with 12gb ram?

    "text": "Pesky allergies \u2013 itchy and watery eyes, sneezing, fatigue \u2013 can completely ruin your day, week or month. Seasonal allergies affect 1 in 5 people; the numerous allergens in the air can penetrate the body\u2019s defenses, triggering an overactive immune response.\nAn allergic reaction occurs when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance \u2013 ragweed, pollen, pet hair, etc. \u2013 that doesn\u2019t typically cause a response in the majority of the population. The response by your immune system is to produce antibodies that target the foreign invader and mark it for destruction by your immune system. Unfortunately, adverse symptoms like stuffed-up sinuses, itchy eyes and fatigue also occur in conjunction with the immune response. This leaves you tired, struggling to focus and constantly rubbing your eyes or blowing your nose.\nSeasonal allergies like itchy and watery eyes can\u2019t be cured, but you can relieve symptoms with natural treatments.\nWhile you can\u2019t cure seasonal allergies, there are a number of conventional and more natural approaches to addressing the symptoms and the root cause. Before we look at your options this fall, let\u2019s take a closer look at the most common (and not so common) symptoms of allergy, along with the worst offenders that trigger these reactions.\nWhat causes these symptoms and the over-activation of your immune system? Here is a short list of the worst allergy offenders.\nRagweed is the most common allergen in the fall. If you struggle with spring allergies, there is a 75% chance you\u2019ll also have reactions to ragweed in the fall. Ragweed begins to release its pollen in late summer, and the symptoms of watery and itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and dark circles under the eyes typically start in September and continue on until the end of October. Think you\u2019re in the clear because ragweed is not in your area? Think again. Ragweed can travel hundreds of miles in the air and if you react to it, you may also suffer from food allergies to bananas, melon, cucumbers, zucchini, and sunflower seeds.\nMold is another major allergy trigger. Damp basements and bathrooms, as well as the damp ground as the leaves change colors and tumble to the ground, are perfect breeding grounds for mold. The return to school for kids can also trigger seasonal allergies, as schools can often be damp with mold present.\nDust mites are most common during the hot summer months, but once you kick up the heating in your house as summer turns to fall, the dust mites will begin to circulate through your house. They can trigger similar symptoms to mold and ragweed above.\nDust mites start to circulate when you turn on the heat in the fall, triggering allergic reactions for some.\nIf you suffer from allergies and visit your doctor, they\u2019ll typically diagnose you based on your symptom presentation, most commonly watery eyes and runny nose. If your doctor suspects multiple or severe allergies, they\u2019ll likely send you to a dermatologist for skin-allergy testing.\nThis type of \u201cskin-scratch\u201d allergy testing is classified as an IgA (or \u201cimmediate\u201d) immune reaction, and the doctor will typically place a series of allergens on your skin to determine which elicit a response. This type of allergy is different than a classic food allergy or IgG reaction, which is \u201cdelayed\u201d and more subtle, taking hours or several days to elicit symptoms (such as fatigue, joint pain, brain fog, dark circles under the eyes, etc.).\nThe standard medical treatments for seasonal allergies are steroid nasal sprays to cool inflammation in the nasal cavity, antihistamines to reduce sneezing and itching, and decongestants to dry up mucous. Unfortunately, none of these therapies targets the \u201croot cause\u201d of the immune system glitch, but rather suppresses its expression (i.e., the symptoms).\nTherefore, these can be effective treatments in the short-term \u2013 so you can get through your day, power through meetings and deadlines, or make it through your CrossFit workout or 5k run. However, in the long run, they\u2019re not the answer. Adding in more natural support can enhance the effectiveness of these conventional treatments and often reduce the dose you need to get through your day. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some great options.\nThe protein in cow\u2019s milk and gluten can leave your immune system in a state of hyperactivity, leading to the worsening of seasonal allergies (1). They can also create more phlegm in your mucous membranes, which can worsen your runny nose, congestion and post-nasal drip. Steer clear of dairy if you\u2019re struggling with allergies.\nQuercetin is a bioflavonoid and potent natural anti-histamine (2). It\u2019s also a potent anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory, which means it can get to the root of your allergies by calming your overactive immune system and cooling unwanted inflammation (3).\nThe best Paleo-friendly food sources of quercetin include veggies and fruits (such as raw red onions and apples), followed by raw asparagus, peppers, tomatoes and leafy greens. Unfortunately, if you suffer from allergies, the 10-50mg of quercetin you might get from foods is likely not potent enough to curb allergies. Consider supplementing with 500mg 2-3x per day for 2-4 weeks, or consult with your local naturopath or functional doctor.\nThe support you need to curb your allergy symptoms may just come from the \u201cpollinators\u201d themselves. A recent study found that regular honey-eaters had markedly reduced allergy symptoms compared to those who abstained (4). Honey has incredible antimicrobial properties and if you source local honey, you\u2019ll have the added advantage of fighting off your nearest allergens. Add it to your tea, mix it into warm water, or include it when making smoothies or shakes.\nStinging nettle (Urtica dioica) has been used for centuries as a medicinal plant, and used commonly in medieval Europe to treat joint pain. The fine hairs of stinging nettle contain chemicals that irritate the skin when they come into contact; ironically, however, they can also act as agents to reduce inflammation in the body (acting much like quercetin as a natural antihistamine) (5).\nStinging nettle tea can reduce inflammation in the body, easing allergy symptoms.\nTry drinking 2-4 cups of stinging nettle tea daily during allergy season (note: it\u2019s also a mild diuretic, so drink a glass of water between each cup of tea) or add a supplement during an acute allergy attack. Go Paleo and cook the leaves, adding them to your greens with dinner (i.e., like spinach) or into your morning smoothie. If your allergies trigger joint pain, they could also be applied topically to the area.\nAlmost all cultures across the globe have ancestral recipes that use the broth from cooked beef, chicken or fish bones to support health and fight off colds and flu as the seasons change. Bone broth soup can also help support seasonal allergies by keeping mucous membranes in the nose and throat clear of mucous and providing key amino acids like glutamine to support a healthy immune response.\nEucalyptus is a wonderful essential oil that has antimicrobial properties (6). To help cool your overactive immune system and fight off allergy symptoms, try a warm steam inhalation. Start by placing 3-4 drops of eucalyptus essential oil in a bowl, then pour about two cups of boiling water into the bowl. Place your face over the bowl (at a small distance so you don\u2019t burn yourself) and a towel over your head\u2026 now breathe through your nose for 8-10 minutes and you\u2019re all set! This is a great regular practice to get into to fight off allergies (as well as colds and flu) through the fall and winter seasons.\nClogged sinuses and mucous-filled lungs are the uncomfortable norm in allergy season for seasonal sufferers. Another essential oil, peppermint, has been shown to be an effective anti-spasmodic to relieve chronic coughing and respiratory congestion due to allergies (7). Peppermint oil can be diffused through the house or your bedroom at night to help ameliorate symptoms (i.e., 4-5 drops).\nFall allergy season is here; limit the foods that can worsen your allergic reaction (i.e., dairy and gluten), increase your intake of anti-inflammatory and anti-histamine nutrients (quercetin, stinging nettles, and raw honey), and reduce congestion and immune reaction with a warm eucalyptus nasal douche. These simple tips can help keep you and your health on track this fall.",

    "text": "Understanding how landscape factors, including suites of geographic and environmental variables, and both historical and contemporary ecological and evolutionary processes shape the distribution of genetic diversity is a primary goal of landscape and conservation genetics and may be particularly consequential for species involved in ecological restoration. In this study, we examine the factors that shape the distribution of genetic variation in a leguminous shrub (Caragana microphylla) important for restoration efforts on the Mongolian Plateau in China. This region houses several major bioclimatic gradients, and C. microphylla is an important restoration species because it stabilizes soils and prevents advancing desertification on the Inner Mongolia Plateau caused by ongoing climate change.\nWe assembled an expansive genomic dataset, consisting of 22 microsatellite loci, four cpDNA regions, and 5788 genome-wide SNPs from ten populations of C. microphylla. We then applied ecological niche modelling and linear and non-linear regression techniques to investigate the historical and contemporary forces that explain patterns of genetic diversity and population structure in C. microphylla on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. We found strong evidence that both geographic and environmental heterogeneity contribute to genetic differentiation and that the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in C. microphylla appears to result partly from the presence of a glacial refugium at the southwestern edge of its current range.\nThese results suggest that geographic, environmental, and historical factors have all contributed to spatial genetic variation in this ecologically important species. These results should guide restoration plans to sustain genetic diversity during plant translocations.\nUnraveling the factors that influence spatial genetic variation and population structure is one of the fundamental goals of ecological and landscape genetics . Patterns of genetic differentiation often reflect spatial variation in gene flow, and landscapes can influence gene flow through geographic and environmental variation and their combined effects [2\u20134]. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) is the correlation of genetic divergence and geographic distances, while isolation-by-environment (IBE) is a correlation between genetic divergence and environmental dissimilarity [5, 6]. IBE can result from environmental differences between populations that generate divergent selection, which reduces dispersal success between different environments, or from biased dispersal, which leads to higher dispersal rates between more similar environments [2, 3, 6, 7]. Thus, both IBD and IBE represent important ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences genetic structure in natural populations [3, 8, 9]. Inherently, geographic and environmental isolation are not mutually exclusive, and spatial genetic divergence among populations can result from reduced gene flow associated with both geographical and ecologic factors [2, 7, 8, 10]. The rise of modern spatial statistical methods and the increasing availability of high-resolution geographic and environmental data layers now make it possible to accurately describe geographic and ecological landscapes and to simultaneously estimate the effects of IBD and IBE on spatial genetic divergence [5, 6]. Understanding patterns of IBD and IBE is particularly important for species of conservation concern or that are involved in ecosystem management, because the outcomes of conservation strategies may depend upon properly managing genetic diversity.\nOne such species is Caragana microphylla, a perennial sandy grassland and desert deciduous shrub species belonging to the legume family (Fabaceae). Native to temperate Asia, including Siberia, Mongolia, and China , C. microphylla is a widely distributed shrub species in the northern steppe and agro-pastoral ecotone of China. On the high plain of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, C. microphylla is a key component of the shrub steppe landscape, and on the sandy land of the steppe it is a dominant species of vegetation . The species has been valued for its tolerance to heat, cold, and drought and for its resistance to wind erosion, sand burial, and hail storms. It has been used as a pioneer leguminous shrub species for vegetation rehabilitation and stabilization of widely degraded and degrading grasslands in China, because of its ability to serve as a windbreak and its capacity for carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, and nutrient accumulation in sandy soils , and it can also be served as supplemental livestock forage with high nutrient value . Genetic variation and population structure of wild C. microphylla from the Inner Mongolia Plateau have been evaluated by different marker systems, including AFLPs, RAPDs, and microsatellites [13\u201317], but no previous studies have quantified the contributions of IBD and IBE to spatial genetic divergence in this system. However, better understanding population dynamics in species like this is an important goal for restoration ecology, ecosystem management, and landscape and conservation genetics. Studies like this one are critical for identifying the factors that shape the distribution of genetic variation in species undergoing assisted dispersal and recolonization so that genetic diversity can be managed properly .\nThe Inner Mongolia Plateau is characterized by pronounced biophysical gradients, presenting an opportunity to investigate the effects of multiple geographic and environmental factors on population connectivity. A temperature gradient runs roughly North-South, while a precipitation gradient runs from arid regions in the Southwest to wetter regions in the Northeast. An ecotone largely tracks the precipitation gradient, transitioning from desert in the Southwest to grassland (high meadow and steppe) in the central plateau and forest in the Northeast, with pockets of shrublands and sandy lands in the Southeast. Here, we evaluated population genetic divergence of C. microphylla across its entire geographic range on the Inner Mongolia Plateau, using a set of 22 polymorphic microsatellite markers, four cpDNA sequences and 5788 SNPs generated through genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The major goals of this study were (i) to characterize genetic variation and population structure in C. microphylla, and (ii) to quantify the relative contributions of geographic factors (IBD) and environmental clines (IBE) to genetic differentiation in this important restoration species.\nWe collected samples from 221 individuals of C. microphylla at ten sites throughout the natural distribution of the species in the southern Inner Mongolia Plateau of China (SZW, ZXB, DL, XH, and QYH), central Inner Mongolia Plateau (XU and DU), and northeastern Inner Mongolia Plateau (EWK, CB, XBY) (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Fig. 1). Together, these sites cover a wide range of climate space, giving us good power to detect environmentally-driven spatial genetic variation (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Sample sizes ranged from N = 18 to 24, with a mean of N = 22 (Additional file 1: Table S1). Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaf tissues using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).\nWe genotyped all samples at 22 microsatellite (simple sequence repeat; SSR) markers (Additional file 1: Table S2) that were developed by Han  using the method described by Lian et al.  (Additional file 1: Table S2). PCR amplification was conducted in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL including 40 ng DNA, 1 \u00d7 buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 \u03bcM dNTPs, 0.6 \u03bcM forward primer and reverse primer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). The forward primers were tagged with a fluorescent 6-FAM or HEX label to produce flourescent-labeled PCR amplified fragments. PCR was performed on a Mastercyler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the following procedure: 10 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 10 touchdown cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 60 s at 65 \u00b0C (\u22121 \u00b0C per cycle), and 60 s at 72 \u00b0C, then 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 \u00b0C, 60 s at 55 \u00b0C, and 60 s at 72 \u00b0C, and a 10 min final extension step at 72 \u00b0C. An ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to capture amplified products by a fluorescence detection system for SSR markers. Fragment sizes were determined using an internal size standard (LIZ500, ABI, USA), and the output was analyzed using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems).\nFour cpDNA regions, including trnL-trnF, psbA-trnH, psbB-psbH and trnG, were amplified for all 221 individuals. The primers and methodology for amplification of these four DNA regions via PCR were described in Taberlet et al. , Demesure et al. , Hamilton , and Shaw et al. , respectively. Sequences were generated with an ABI 3730XL DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems), and edited, assembled and aligned in Geneious (v7.1.7, http://www.geneious.com/). All cpDNA sequences were deposited in Genbank (accession numbers KU564257 to KU564268).\nA total of 127 samples from ten populations were used to generate the genotyping by sequencing dataset (GBSseq; Additional file 1: Table S1). Individual DNA libraries for each of these samples were prepared using the restriction enzyme ApeKI according to the protocol in Elshire et al. . Libraries were then sequenced using paired-end sequencing across 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq 4000 (BGI, Shengzhen, China). The quality of the raw read data was examined using FASTQC . GBS data assembly, mapping, and SNP discovery were performed using Stacks v1.23 . In the absence of a reference genome for this species, RADSeq loci were assembled de novo using the \u2018denovo_map.pl\u2019 pipeline in STACKS. We used a parameter combination recommended by Mastretta-Yanes et al. : minimum read depth to create a stack (\u2212m) = 3, number of mismatches allowed between loci within individuals (\u2212M) = 2, and number of mismatches allowed between loci within each catalogue (\u2212n) = 2. All other parameters were kept at default values. Those loci present in at least 80% of individuals at each site were retained in the final dataset, and loci with minor allele frequencies lower than 0.05 were removed. GBS genotyping of the samples from population SZW resulted in significant missing data, so this population was removed from the GBS dataset. GBS-seq raw data were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with reference number SRP071628.\nAll 22 microsatellite loci were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We calculated common metrics of genetic variation, including average number of alleles (Na), observed and expected heterozygosity (Ho and He), and global and pairwise FST. Both global and pairwise FST were tested for significance based on 9999 permutations. All calculations and statistical tests were conducted using GenAlEx v6.5 .\nWe used the software STRUCTURE to infer the probability of assignment to distinct genetic clusters for all 221 individuals in the ten sampled populations . The analysis was performed using the admixture model and with the option of correlated allele frequencies between populations. Ten runs were conducted for each value for the number of genetic clusters (K), with K ranging from 1 to 10. The length of the burn-in for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) replications was set to 10,000, and data were collected every 1000 steps over a total length 100,000 MCMC steps in each run. We identified the optimal value of K using the method developed by Evanno et al.  as implemented in the software Structure Harvester .\nChloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences were edited and assembled using SeqMan software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Multiple alignments of the DNA sequences were performed with Clustal X , with subsequent adjustment in Bioedit . Haplotype (Hd) and nucleotide (\u03c0) diversities were calculated from aligned DNA sequences using DnaSP v5 . We conducted an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and tested for significance based on 1023 permutations in Arlequin v3.0 . A haplotype distribution map was constructed using ArcMap v9.3 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, California, USA), and a haplotype network was constructed in NETWORK v4.678  using Medicago sativa as an outgroup.\nObserved and expected heterozygosities (Ho and He) were calculated using the package Adegenet v2.0.1.  in R (www.r-project.org). Both global and pairwise FST were calculated and tested for significance based on 9999 permutations using Genepop v4.0 . As with the microsatellite dataset, we also performed STRUCTURE analysis  on our GBS dataset, using the admixture model and the same MCMC parameters as before.\nWe used climate-based ecological niche models (ENMs) at multiple time periods to investigate whether current and past climate suitability is a relevant factor shaping observed patterns of genetic differentiation among populations of C. microphylla. Ecological niche modelling was carried out in MAXENT v3.3.3 . A total of 53 occurrence points, obtained from the literature [13\u201316] and our own sampling, and 19 GIS data layers at 2.5 arc min resolution for present-day bioclimatic variables, obtained from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org), were included in the analysis (Additional file 1: Table S3).\nTo estimate the distribution of C. microphylla at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), we projected the model obtained by our present-day species-climate analysis onto the LGM using data layers for past climate constructed under the commonly used Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC v3.2)  scaled down to a 2.5 arc min resolution and obtained from WorldClim. To model the suitability of C. microphylla under a future climate scenario, we acquired data layers (2.5 arc min resolution) predicted for the year 2080 under, again, the commonly used general circulation model MIROC from WorldClim. As with the LGM scenario, we projected the present-day ENM onto the future climate layers to explore how the predicted distribution of C. microphylla may be affected by ongoing global climate change. The performance of the model prediction was evaluated using the area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) calculated by MAXENT. Model predictions were visualized in ARCMAP v9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA).\nTo investigate the roles of geographic and environmental factors in spatial genetic differentiation, we tested for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) using all three marker types collected in our study. In all analyses, population pairwise genetic distances were represented by matrices of pairwise FST / (1-FST) as recommended by Rousset . Geographic distances were represented by the logarithms (log10) of geographic distances between all pairs of populations. For the environmental predictors, we downloaded the 19 bioclimate variables from the WorldClim database (www.worldclim.org) at 0.5 arc min resolution and then reduced covariance by performing spatial principal component analysis (PCA) analysis on the raster layers using the R package \u2018RStoolbox\u2019 . We retained the first three PC rasters that resulted from this analysis and extracted the value of the data point on each raster at each of the coordinates for our sampled populations. To quantify IBD and IBE, we performed multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) using the R function \u2018MMRR\u2019 . We also tested for covariance between geographic and environmental distances with a Mantel test using the R package \u2018vegan\u2019 . In each analysis, 10,000 permutations were used to generate a null distribution for significance testing.\nTo further evaluate IBD and IBE, we also performed a complementary analysis, generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). GDM is a statistical technique that uses nonlinear matrix regression to model spatial patterns of biological dissimilarity, including genetic distance, between sampling sites against differences in geographic and environmental variables . GDM uses an I-spline turnover function for each predictor variable to quantify: (1) variation in the rate of genetic turnover along each environmental and geographic axis (the shape of each spline) while controlling for all other variables, and (2) the curvilinear relationships between genetic distance and geographic and environmental distances [46, 47]. The maximum height of each spline corresponds to the relative importance of the associated predictor .\nGenetic distances for each model were the same FST / (1-FST) matrices used in the MMRR analysis, and geographic distances were based on the geographic coordinates of each sampling site. For the environmental predictors, we used the same three PC rasters as in the MMRR analysis. After fitting the GDM model to these data, we visualized spatial patterns of genetic turnover by projecting the GDM model onto the PC rasters. This assigns a color value to each cell on the raster based on its predicted genetic composition, and greater differences in the colors between cells indicate greater predicted genetic differences. All of the GDM analyses were performed in the R package \u2018gdm\u2019 .\nTwenty-two microsatellite markers were used to evaluate genetic diversity across 221 individuals of 10 populations of C. microphylla (Table 1). The mean number of alleles per locus (Na) ranged from 5.318 in population XBY to 8.091 in population DU (Table 1). Mean observed heterozygosity per population (Ho) ranged from 0.416 in CB to 0.693 in QYH, and mean expected heterozygosity (He) values ranged from 0.490 in XBY to 0.708 in DU. We did not detect significant deviations from HWE in any of the 22 loci.\nA total of 11 different cpDNA haplotypes (H1-H11) were identified based on 7 polymorphic sites detected in four cpDNA sequences (Table 1). Haplotypes H1 and H2 were the two most common haplotypes, found in 70% and 50% of C. microphylla populations, respectively (Fig. 1b). Haplotypes H3, H6, and H10, on the other hand, were found in only one population each (Fig. 1b). Haplotypes H8 and H4 were identified as the most ancestral and youngest haplotypes, respectively. The populations ETW, CB, and XBY had the lowest haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) with only one haplotype (H8) observed in each population. The highest diversity was observed in population SZW (Hd = 0.771 and \u03c0 = 0.47; Table 1).\nOverall, 5788 SNPs from our GBS reads were retained for 106 individuals from 9 populations after quality control and filtering steps. Mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) per population ranged from 0.196 in CB to 0.303 in XH, and mean expected heterozygosity (He) values ranged from 0.247in CB to 0.308 in XH (Table 1).\nGlobal FST among all 10 sampling sites based on our microsatellite dataset was 0.115. The pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation (FST) across all 10 populations ranged from 0.017 (ZXB vs. XH) to 0.139 (XBY vs. QYH) (Additional file 1: Table S4). All C. microphylla population pairs were significantly differentiated from each other except for the ZXB and XH pair, for which FST was not significantly different from zero. Comparisons between regions revealed little structure between the central (DU and XU) and northeast (CB, EWK, and XBY) populations (mean FST = 0.071) nor between the central and southwest (QYH, SZW, DL, XH, and ZXB) populations (mean FST = 0.073), but did reveal higher differentiation between the northeast and the southwest populations (mean FST = 0.138). The population XBY showed the highest degree of genetic differentiation from other populations (mean FST = 0.171), followed by populations CB (mean FST = 0.168) and EWK (mean FST = 0.138).\nFor cpDNA, global FST among all sites was 0.360. About 76% of pairwise FST estimates among C. microphylla population pairs were statistically significant (Additional file 1: Table S5). Pairwise comparisons between regions revealed similar patterns compared to the microsatellite results. The mean genetic differentiation between northeast and southwest populations was FST = 0.64, followed by southwest vs. central populations (mean FST = 0.48), and northeast vs. central populations (mean FST = 0.17).\nFor our GBS dataset of 5788 SNPs, global FST among the nine sampling sites retained in this dataset was 0.246. Pairwise comparisons between regions revealed similar patterns compared to the microsatellite and cpDNA results (Additional file 1: Table S6). The mean genetic differentiation estimates between southwest vs. central populations and northeast vs. central populations were FST = 0.164 and FST = 0.168, respectively. Whereas, the mean genetic differentiation between northeast and southwest populations was FST = 0.350.\nSTRUCTURE analyses performed on both our microsatellite and GBS datasets indicated that the best supported number of clusters was K = 2, according to the \u0394K methods for identifying the optimal number of clusters (Additional file 1: Figure S2). The probability of membership to either of the two clusters (A and B) was geographically structured among populations and regions (Figs. 1, 2). Specifically, the membership proportions in the STRUCTURE analysis revealed a significant geographic pattern in which individuals in populations mostly associated with cluster A (i.e. SZW, ZXB, XH, DL, and QYH) were more common in the southwest of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (41\u00b0N - 42\u00b0N; Fig. 1a, 2a), while individuals in populations mostly associated with cluster B (i.e. EWK, CB, and XBY) were found in the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (48\u00b0N- 49\u00b0N; Fig. 1a, 2a). In the central region of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (44\u00b0N - 45\u00b0N), two populations (XU and DU) showed intermediate probabilities of assignment to either cluster, based on the microsatellite dataset (Fig. 1a, 2a). This could result from potential admixture, shared ancestry, or demographic factors. Of the two central populations, although the XU population is more southerly, it shared genetic cluster assignments (35.6% in cluster A and 64.4% in cluster B) more with the populations in the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Plateau than with those in the southwest. The DU population, on the other hand, showed more similar genetic assignments (72.3% in cluster A and 27.7% in cluster B) to the populations in the southwest of the Inner Mongolia Plateau, even though it is geographically closer to the northeast populations (Fig. 1a, 2a). In contrast, the assignment probabilities for individuals in these populations based on the GBS dataset (Fig. 1c, 2b) were much more closely aligned with cluster A (the southwest populations) compared to those based on the microsatellite data (Fig. 1a vs. 1c; Fig. 2a vs. 2b).\nThree climate-based ecological niche models were constructed using 19 bioclimatic variables for three time periods: present day, the last glacial maximum (LGM), and the future (year 2080) (Fig. 3). The model based on present-day data showed strong support based on the receiver operating curve (AUC > 0.95), suggesting good model fit to the underlying data. The present-day predicted distribution of C. microphylla is consistent with its presently observed distribution (Fig. 3b). In total, precipitation had a greater influence on C. microphylla than temperature, as indicated by jackknife resampling of the regularized training gain (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Compared with its current distribution, the estimated distribution of C. microphylla during the LGM was much smaller, based on projection of the present-day model onto past climate layers, suggesting that a significant expansion occurred after the LGM from the southwest to the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Plateau (Fig. 3a). The ENM projected onto the future climate scenario for 2080 suggests that climate change will result in a significant reduction of the species\u2019 potential range (Fig. 3c), resulting in a retraction to a small zone of climatically suitable habitat in the southwest-central part of C. microphylla\u2019s current distribution.\nThe spatial PCA that we performed on the 19 bioclimate data layers returned three PC rasters that explained >85% of the total bioclimatic variation. Factors loadings showed that PC1 was primarily described by temperature variables (Bio1\u201311; www.worldclim.org), while PC2 was derived from precipitation variables (Bio12\u201319; www.worldclim.org). PC3 was driven by three variables \u2013 precipitation seasonality (Bio15), mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2), and temperature annual range (Bio7) \u2013 and therefore represents an environmental seasonality and range of variation axis.\nMultiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) analysis suggested that genetic differentiation showed a significant pattern of both IBE and IBD for all three molecular datasets (Table 2 and Fig. 4). For each of the microsatellite, cpDNA, and GBS datasets, the model was a significant fit to the data (p < 0.001for each; Table 2), and explained a large proportion of the total variance (R2 = 0.685, R2 = 0.696, R2 = 888, respectively; Table 2). The signal of IBE in each dataset was driven by PC1 (temperature variables), which had a significant association with genetic distances in all three cases (p < 0.01 for each model; Table 2). PC2 and PC3 did not have significant correlations with genetic distances for any of the three molecular markers (p > 0.05; Table 2). IBE was slightly stronger than IBD in the cpDNA (IBE = 0.515, IBD = 0.361) and GBS datasets (IBE = 0.564, IBD = 0.444) and was considerably stronger than IBD in the microsatellite dataset (IBE = 0.702, IBD = 0.260; Table 2). Geographic distances were moderately correlated with distances in PC1 (Mantel\u2019s r = 0.685, p = 0.001) and PC3 (Mantel\u2019s r = 0702, p = 0.002) but showed no correlation with PC2 (Mantel\u2019s r = 0.044, p = 0.553).\nGeneralized dissimilarity modelling (GDM; Ferrier et al. 2007) analysis also revealed significant patterns of IBE and IBD in all three of our molecular datasets (Table 3). Overall, the models were a significant fit to the data (p < 0.01 for each model) and explained a large proportion of the deviance in the data structure, with 77.95% of deviance explained for the microsatellite dataset, 74.81% of deviance explained for the cpDNA dataset, and 89.18% of deviance explained for the GBS dataset. Deviance explained values for non-linear models are analogous to R2 values for linear models. Concordant with the results of the MMRR analysis, GDM revealed significant associations between genetic distances and PC3 distances for each dataset (p < 0.05; Table 3). IBE was stronger than IBD in the microsatellite dataset (IBE = 0.561, IBD = 0.132; Table 3) but slightly weaker than IBD in the cpDNA (IBE = 0.473, IBD = 0.627; Table 3) and GBS (IBE = 0.622, IBD = 0.717; Table 3) datasets. In general, maps of spatial turnover in genetic composition generated by GDM show similar patterns for the microsatellite and GBS datasets (Fig. 5).\nChina\u2019s Inner Mongolia Plateau contains dramatic clines in several bioclimatic variables that are critical for plant growth and community assembly and also exhibits spatial heterogeneity in various soil properties and characteristics , making it an excellent landscape on which to examine the geographic and environmental drivers of population genetic structure. This region contains high elevation arid steppe and sandy soils ecosystems that are traditionally understudied in landscape genetics and phylogeography. The need to better understand population dynamics in key species in these ecosystems is pressing because the entire region is heavily threatened by soil erosion, desertification, and ongoing climate change .\nIn this study, we utilized large genomic datasets, including 22 microsatellites, cpDNA sequences from four gene regions, and 5788 SNPs, to characterize patterns of range-wide genetic differentiation across biophysical clines in C. microphylla, an important species for ecological restoration efforts, on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. We found that genetic diversity (haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity, average number of alleles, and heterozygosity) was distributed across the range of the species, with more centrally located populations typically showing higher levels of genetic diversity than populations nearer to range edges, particularly to the northern range edge of this species (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This spatial pattern of genetic diversity is fairly common in many different and diverse taxa . While genetic variation can have many other spatial distributions, this \u201cabundant center hypothesis,\u201d in which central populations harbor greater diversity appears to be one scenario that is observed fairly frequently [51, 52]. Under any scenario, better understanding the spatial distribution of genetic variation is central to developing improved management plans for maintaining genetic diversity and for predicting the impacts of potential threats to genetic diversity .\nThe exceptions to this general pattern in our study system were found in the southern populations that we sampled. Several of these populations (e.g. DL, SZQ, XH, and ZXB) harbored among the highest levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity (based on our cpDNA dataset), allelic diversity (based on our microsatellite dataset), and observed heterozygosity (based on our microsatellite and GBS datasets; Table 1 and Fig. 1). This pattern may be explained by the historical distribution of C. microphylla. When the ecological niche model that we constructed was projected onto past climate layers from the last glacial maximum (LGM), it suggested that suitable habitat for C. microphylla was much more limited, compared to present day, and was primarily restricted to an area in the southwest corner of C. microphylla\u2019s current range. This suggests that a northward expansion following glacial retreat after the LGM allowed C. microphylla to achieve the distribution it has today. Glacial refugia often harbor greater genetic diversity, particularly in plants [53\u201355], and that appears to be the case here as well, demonstrating how biogeographic histories can influence patterns of genetic diversity observed today.\nTo investigate how contemporary landscape factors affect patterns of genetic variation in C. microphylla, we conducted a landscape genetic analysis in which we employed complimentary linear and non-linear matrix regression analyses to quantify patterns of IBD and IBE. Multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR)  and generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM)  revealed strong evidence that both geographic and environmental factors play important roles in structuring genetic variation in this system. Overall, the results of our MMRR and GDM analyses were highly concordant, but there were some minor differences (Tables 2, 3). Some of these differences are likely due to the linear vs. non-linear regressions used in MMRR and GDM, respectively [44, 46]. Whether the observed differences result from GDM over-fitting the model or MMRR under-fitting the model is not currently known. In any case, our results can be viewed as strong evidence that IBD and IBE are both significant patterns of genetic differentiation in C. microphylla, even if their precise strengths are uncertain, and therefore geographic and environmental factors are both important contributors to the genetic structuring of populations in this system.\nThere were also slight differences among our three genetic datasets. If we average the results for the MMRR and GDM analyses, we find that IBE played a considerably stronger role than IBD in structuring genetic variation in the microsatellite data (\u03b2IBE = 0.196 vs. \u03b2IBD = 0.631), but IBE and IBD were much more balanced in the cpDNA (\u03b2IBE = 0.494 vs. \u03b2IBD = 0.494) and GBS datasets (\u03b2IBE = 0.581 vs \u03b2IBD = 0.593). There is no clear reason why microsatellite markers would be expected to have lower IBD than cpDNA or GBS markers. There is an interesting possibility that chloroplast DNA, which is uni-parentally inherited through seeds, could show a different spatial pattern from nuclear DNA, which is bi-parentally inherited through seeds and pollen, if dispersal in seeds and pollen are subject to different controls. For instance, if different animals disperse seeds and pollen, which is commonly the case, or if pollen is wind dispersed while seeds fall onto the underlying terrain, then we would expect that patterns of spatial genetic variation in cpDNA and nuclear DNA could be very different . For C. microphylla, which has pollen dispersed by wind and insect pollinators , we would expect that nDNA markers would show a greater signal of IBE compared to IBD, because geographic factors would be much more limiting for seed dispersal. In fact, we do see that IBE is slightly higher than IBD for our nuclear microsatellite and GBS datasets, while IBE and IBD are very similar in our cpDNA dataset, but this difference is fairly subtle.\nThe GDM and MMRR analyses both detected a significant signal that variation between populations in environmental PC1 drives the pattern of IBE. This signal was highly significant (p \u2264 0.02) and explained a large proportion of genetic variation (\u03b2 = 0.383 to 0.565) in all three of our genetic datasets in the results of both MMRR and GDM analysis (Tables 2, 3). Signals for PC2 and PC3 were not significant in any dataset under either analysis. PC1 captured variation in the bioclimatic temperature variables in our environmental GIS dataset. Hence, our results suggest that IBE in C. microphylla is primarily driven by differences in temperature variables between populations. Both phenology and leaf emergence are linked to temperature cues in C. microphylla [57, 58]. Flowering period in C. microphylla lasts less than 30 days, and shifts in flowering period occur under different experimental temperature treatments . This suggests that differences in temperature regimes between populations may cause differences in phenology which lead to reduced overlap in flowering period and, therefore, reduced gene flow. This pattern of reduced overlap in reproductive timing has been referred to as \u2018isolation by time\u2019  and may be a key factor driving genetic structure in this system.\nThus, overall, our study presents a strong case for a role of both historic and contemporary factors, including both geographic and environmental variables, in generating the currently observed patterns of spatial genetic variation in C. microphylla. For plants involved in ecological restoration, like C. microphylla, understanding these patterns is critical, because restoration work inherently involves moving plants between areas (even if they are geographically close). For instance, in this system, populations exhibit genetic differentiation between environments with different temperature regimes, and therefore restoration efforts should focus on transplanting between areas with similar environmental conditions. Plants adapted to different thermal climates may flower at the wrong time or out of sync with the local population, reducing the effectiveness of transplant efforts. Because C. microphylla also show geographically driven genetic differentiation, plants that are transplanted from distant sites that are environmentally similar could be effective at introducing genetic variation into struggling populations . Hence, better understanding the factors that shape genetic variation in these species is critical for preventing unintended consequences of reintroductions and translocations and for guiding conservation plans to produce the best possible outcomes. Specifically, the knowledge generated by studies like ours can contribute to managing how genetic variation is distributed in these species, the probability of individuals surviving and becoming established under various climatic factors, and the chances of maintaining genetically healthy populations.\nWe thank Prof. Tieliang Shang Guan, Shanxi University, for the sampling and identification of the plant material and the UC Berkeley Geospatial Innovation Facility for providing GIS software.\nThis research was funded by a grant from the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP-IAS10) of China.

    "text": "The Columbus Dispatch Publishes Article on HB 413 | Public Employee Retirees Inc.\n(February 19, 2018) A revealing article on the status of H.B. 413 was published in the Sunday edition of The Columbus Dispatch yesterday shedding light on where the bill stands in the legislative process. It was authored by Dispatch reporter Catherine Candisky and can be read by copying and pasting this link in your web browser: http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180217/opers-retirees-fight-back-against-proposed-cut-in-benefits. It appears that in its present form the bill is not going to move toward passage in the Ohio House, according to its sponsor, Rep. Gary Scherer (R \u2013 Circleville). This is good news for PERI members and all OPERS retirees.\nPERI resolves to keep up the fight against the passage of HB 413 until OPERS and the General Assembly recognize the need to maintain the current 3% COLA.\nThanks PERI, finally a ray of hope .\nFood for thought for all retirees, Keep contacting members of the general assembly to vote down h.b.413! Keep the heat on!\nWhat is meant by, \u201cIt appears that in its present form the bill is not going to move toward passage in the Ohio House\u201d? It sounds like good news at first, but the issue is not over. I\u2019m very happy by this delay, but we still need to work to have it dropped altogether.\nSomething seems very wrong here. With all the sweeping changes OPERS made since 2012, including dropping spouses and jacking up premiums, why aren\u2019t they putting money into the health care plan? If the current administration can\u2019t seem to manage our money, maybe it\u2019s time to find others who will. This doesn\u2019t add up and an independent investigation seems to be in order.\nI would like to share some info. with all retirees. i retired from O.D.O.T. in 2012. When i worked for O.D.O.T. I was active in o.c.s.e.a. for a time. O.c.s.e.a. is the union for state employees in most agencies. When opers introduced their c.o.l.a. reduction fiasco last august, I contacted Chris Mabe who is o.c.s.e.a. president and opers board member for state employees. As per the conversation, The reasons he gave me for the proposal were as follows. The alleged 2 billion dollars in unfunded liabilities as per Karen Carraher. Mabe also gave me a personal reason for the proposal. Mabe told me he thinks it is not fair that people who retired prior to Jan. 2013 keep their 3% C.O.L.A. And people who retired after Jan. 2013 get their c.o.l.a. adjusted as agreed upon in the 2012 opers changes. So with this info. you have an opers board member who also had personal reasons for pushing this proposal. I spoke to Chris Mabe over the phone in late august of 2017. He returned the phone call after I left him a message on his voicemail. I also emailed him at that time.\nWell what everyone has to remember is if your already retired you have no way to increase your percent of retirement other than the COLA. If your not already retired you have the option to work longer and increase your retirement. \u201c Go figure \u201c Compell people who can retire before 2013 by sending out papers that say anyone who retires prior to 2013 will recieve 3 % COLA fixed ,then switch it with H.B. 413 COLA based off cpi after. People already retired don\u2019t have an equal right to work longer and boost there percentage and increase there F.A.S. I believe PERI was able to exspress that concern during there presentation in Opposition of H.B 413.\nRon Alexander is a candidate for OPERS Trustee to represent the retirees. He is also the retiree representative on the OCSEA Board with Mabe. I have emailed Ron Alexander requesting his position on this issue. We certainly don\u2019t need two OSCEA officials on the OPERS Board voting together to cut our COLA.\nRight. We do not need a fox in the hen house.\nMore food for thought. Late last December, The Opers board voted to make Chris Mabe Vice Chair!\nSo I just read the Dispatch article and here\u2019s what bothers me. It is clear that Karen Carraher is trying to play on the fear that If we don\u2019t make these changes now we risk healthcare in the future. What I urge everyone to consider is that regardless of whether they make changes or not we could still lose or have changes made to our healthcare in the future. Healthcare is not a guaranteed benefit. I for one will not stand for changes being made to a guaranteed benefit, which my 3% annual COLA is, to take the chance that they won\u2019t turn around at some point in the future and reduce or eliminate healthcare anyway. I won\u2019t fall for their scare tactics.\nRetiree \u2013 I totally agree. I will not stand for changes to a guaranteed benefit either. If they take that away, then everything is fair game.\nThe article in the Columbus Dispatch was an interesting read. Keep up the good work, PERI!\nAlthough this is encouraging we can\u2019t let up. I have written to my State Representative and Senator and have received a response only from my Representative that he is opposed to HB 413. So far my state Senator seems to be non-committed.\nRemember the old adage \u201cthe squeeky wheel gets the grease\u201d.\nJerry \u2013 That is very interesting. I have long suspected a severe case of COLA envy has been going around at OPERS. And yes, I believe those pushing the proposal have a personal agenda. Otherwise, nothing else makes sense. The system is healthy and with the sweeping changes made including dropping spouses and jacking up our health care premiums, there should be no reason for fear of losing health care funding.\nAs the old adage goes, when something doesn\u2019t make sense, look for the dollars.\nWhere did you obtain information on the 3 candidates and their positions?\nThanks James for your insight. I agree after reading the Retiree Representative Candidate Biographies page included with my ballot, it becomes clear that Timothy Steitz is the correct choice if you want to protect your 3% COLA. His job experience and credentials make him the most qualified candidate to oppose Carraher\u2019s dirty mess now and in the future. It\u2019s important for anyone who hasn\u2019t voted yet to do it now before the March 30th deadline and keep contacting our state legislative officials.\nEvery day I e-mail, tweet, call or write. I point out the 50 people at OPERS making more than the governor, the billions invested in poor performing hedge funds, the most of any State and paying the managers of those hedge funds billions since 2011 and also paying their own chief financial officer over 1/2 million a year and millions more in incentives. Incentives for what, to invest in poor performing hedge funds or does he get incentives for cutting our COLA. Kasich was with Lehman Brothers and went around Ohio talking the public pensions into investing in Lehman Brothers. Lehman went out of business and the pensions lost multi millions. He becomes governor in 2011 along with Carrahar and we start investing in hedge funds. Funny hedge funds donated to his run for President in 2016.\nThis cozy relationship the OPERS seems to have with some of the medical providers needs to be looked at. Double Dipping needs to be looked at, California does not allow it at all, go back to a public employee and your pension stops. I don\u2019t know if we need to go that far, but the amount they pay in for pension goes into an annuity. That money should stay in the pension system, they are already collecting a pension and working for a public employee. QEBA needs stopped, violating IRS rules stating that they don\u2019t have to pay pension out over around 215,000 per year. QEBA makes that extra money come out of the medical fund. I could go on for pages, however, that is some thing needing fixed.\nKeep writing as the State and every organization in it hates the sun light shine down upon them. When I worked I was told to work on clients that bitched first. Why should they get serviced first? The answer, we don\u2019t want to have them calling every day and bothering us. Is that fair, no, but the squeaking wheel gets fixed first.\nMichael \u2013 Could you share copies of your letters? I don\u2019t know the facts like you do. I would like to send that information to my representatives too.\nFirst, the \u201c3% COLA\u201d quit being a 3% increase in retirement benefits one year after retirement. It is a simple interest increase on the base retirement amount. It is NOT a true cost of living increase. Rather it is: 3%, 2.91%, 2.83%, 2.75%, 2.68%, 2.61%, 2.54%, etc. Next year I will get a 2.4% increase. We retirees who retired prior to 2013 are both diminishing in both numbers and our effective COLA increases. The only reason that I can see for the OPERS board to act now is because it will become a moot point in a the future. They want to treat retirees as welfare recipients. Why else would HB 413 contain a provision to INCREASE the retirement for a select few retirees?\nSecond, as determined in the case of John J. MASCIO v. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO, the vested rights statute (ORC 145.561), once the conditions of retirement are fulfilled, there is a contractual obligation. The Ohio Legislature (OPERS) does NOT have a legal right to alter a contract after the fact.\nThird, why the heck would any rational person (retiree) wish to trade a statutory guaranteed contractual right (pension + COLA) for the \u201cpromise\u201d of health care? Back when I was working, 35 years, a percentage of my contribution was going for the health care of retirees. Now that I am retired, the OPERS board has cut health care to the bone and is out to get retirees who may have gotten a few percent ahead of inflation.\nFinally, I\u2019m not trying to be political but the Federal deficit spending is such that the ten year Treasury rate is approaching 3%. Depending on the financial projection, 3% or 3.5%, is the break point at which money flows from the stock market to bonds and inflation becomes inevitable. Either way, a one trillion dollar Federal deficit will lead to higher inflation. That higher inflation will inflate OPERS investments, but will not change our COLA.\nDean you just made a fantastic point, Retirees do not need Ron Alexander on the Opers board to represent retirees. Ron Alexander will be a yes person for Karen Carraher. Chris Mabe has proved he is a yes person for Karen Carraher! Retirees please consider not giving Ron Alexander a vote! I hope Alexander has an opponent for this board seat! If Ron Alexander has an opponent, Please consider that person! Ron Alexander is still on the O.C.S.E.A. payroll as an retirees Rep. He has taken enough dues money as o.c.s.e.a. president and now in this role as a retirees rep! I was an o.c.s.e.a. activist for a time. The internal politics at o.c.s.e.a. is sickening! Just food for thought. Thanks.\nI witnessed Ron Alexander manipulate the members and staff at o.c.s.e.a. for years! Please consider not voting for him for this open opers board seat! Please consider the opponents of Ron Alexander for this opers board seat! To vote Ron Alexander on the opers board would be a huge mistake. Remember, Chris Mabe will be lobbying on his behalf. And in private, I am sure Karen Carraher will be doing the same. She will be very quiet in doing so.\nI\u2019ll keep writing and making phone calls until there is a full administration restructuring at OPERS.\nJim \u2013 Who are you contacting? I will do likewise.\nAttention all retirees, I have taken a careful look at all the candidates for the open Opers board seat. I will vote for Tim Steitz, He seems to be the candidate that will stand up for retirees. Just food for thought. Vote carefully.\nIf you worked when Ron Alexander was head of the union\u2026 you know he was very friendly to the statehouse. Personally I believe that the State of Ohio employees did benefit from collective bargaining I am just saying that was not while Ron Alexander was running things he was very close fo to management we do not need his self serving agenda in our retirement. Most people do not realize that public sector is not always the easy jobs they think. Too many managers politically connected (and union presidents) willing to do whatever necessary for their own personal advancement . But I thought once retired we would be away from the politics and the deals made in back rooms. Karen Carraher does not have enough respect for retirees to keep her as OPERS Ex Director. She wants to say that she has OPERS funded 100% and will do so at any cost. Keep fighting calling writing and unfortunately not relaxing and enjoying our earned retirements. Ohio politics once again rears its ugly head. We are fortunate that some in the statehouse see OPERS bill for what it is\u2026. an unnecessary broken promise to retirees. Don\u2019t stop being vocal, writing and calling state reps and telling them OPERS needs to keep their gritty hands off of our COLA.\nI noted it in my retirement letter as well. Actually I stated that it was \u201cthe\u201d reason for the timing.\nAmen Frank! It is time retirees post their concerns about Ron Alexander on social media. All retirees should know about the troublesome background of Mr. Alexander! Also, It is time retirees start calling for Karen Carraher to be replaced! Start sounding the alarm on social media!\nChris Mabe is just as bad as Ron Alexander if not worse!\nI\u2019m with those who will vote for Tim Seitz as my candidate of choice. Thanks to those you who shared your views on all three candidates. Your comments were really helpful.\nThe comments helped me vote for Mr. Seitz too. This kind of input is always great.\nI voted for Mr. Seitz also.",

In a very young age, he had lost majority of his hair from frontal and crown area of his scalp. Like many of the people, his unusual hair loss was a cause of social embarrassment to him.\nIn his initial phase, he was his own doctor! He tried several shampoos, supplements and alternative treatment options of camouflage, which ultimately made him more depressed with the increase in hair loss; this forced him to come to us and opt for the hair restoration with PRP.\nFig. 1: \u2013 A baseline photograph of first hair check to establish a basic measurements.

    "text": "As part of their licence renewal applications, all licensees of private commercial radio stations are asked to make an annual financial commitment to Canadian talent development. Financial commitments to projects relating to Canadian talent development are also frequently included as part of the benefits proposed in applications for authority to transfer the ownership or control of existing radio stations or in applications for licences to operate new radio stations. The Commission has considered that all such contributions are important to help ensure that there is a sufficiently large pool of Canadian music and other Canadian creative material available for broadcast.\nOver the years, a number of concerns have been raised with respect to the Commission's policy guidelines for Canadian talent development. Radio broadcasters have expressed the view that the level of financial commitment they are asked to make is too high at a time when many radio stations are facing financial difficulties. Concerns have also been raised about the high level of detail that is involved in the Commission's administration of the Canadian talent development process. Currently, each commitment by a radio station licensee is evaluated to ensure that it qualifies as an acceptable Canadian talent development initiative. The overall financial commitment for each radio station is compared with those of otherradio stations with similar revenues in markets of similar size to ensure that the level of the commitment is adequate.\nIn Public Notice CRTC 1995-61, the Commission concluded that a more streamlined approach to Canadian talent development is necessary, given the diminishing resources of both radio licensees and the Commission. It emphasized, however, that adequate funding should continue to be provided to third-party organizations involved in Canadian talent development, because of the important role these organizations play in increasing the availability of Canadian music, and their reliance on Canadian talent development contributions from radio stations for a significant share of their revenues.\nThe Commission also stated that commitments for Canadian talent development made in the context of applications for new radio licences or changes in ownership must continue to be fulfilled.\n* At licence renewal, licensees of all private commercial radio stations would continue to be expected to make annual direct financial commitments to Canadian talent development sufficient to ensure that FACTOR, MusicAction, and other third-party organizations continue to receive annual funding from radio licensees totalling not less than $1.8 million. These funds would be contributed by individual broadcasters directly to eligible third parties.\n* Radio licensees would generally be required to fulfil commitments for Canadian talent development accepted as part of benefits packages proposed in applications to transfer ownership or effective control of undertakings. Similarly, licensees of new radio stations would generally be required to fulfil all Canadian talent development commitments during their initial licence terms.\nIn addition to its call for comments on the general approach to Canadian talent development, the Commission requested the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) to submit a proposal for a mechanism that would ensure that at least $1.8 million annually is provided by radio licensees to eligible third parties, including details concerning how such a system would operate and be administered.\nA total of 35 comments were received in response to the Commission's call. Commercial broadcasters generally supported the Commission's proposed approach, noting that radio already contributes to Canadian talent by playing Canadian records and by making copyright payments to authors, composers and music publishers. They considered that the $1.8 million target proposed for licence renewal commitments was reasonable, given the current financial difficulties faced by the radio industry, and would ensure continued funding for parties that have come to rely on the direct financial contributions of radio licensees. They also expressed the view that many local Canadian talent development projects would continue without the involvement of the Commission because of their promotional value for the sponsoring stations.\nCommunity broadcasters made references to the contributions made to Canadian talent development by not-for-profit radio stations, and expressed the view that private radio stations must continue to make a contribution as well.\nParties associated with the recording and music industries had a mixed response to the proposed approach. Some considered that the target of $1.8 million was too low and could become a maximum rather than a minimum target. Some proposed that a portion of the money now going to local initiatives should be given to third parties. Certain parties suggested that adherence by a licensee, both to its overall commitment to Canadian talent development, and to its individual financial commitments to particular organizations, should be required by condition of licence. A full review of the financial state of the radio industry was suggested by one party.\nThe CBC and several other parties argued that air-play for new artists was at least as important as financial contributions for the development of Canadian talent. In this context, one individual suggested that all Canadian radio stations should be required to ensure that at least 15% of musical selections broadcast are by new Canadian artists.\nAn educational institution suggested that the list of third parties who are eligible for Canadian talent development payments should be expanded to include provincially- administered, post-secondary training programs.\nIn response to the Commission's request, the CAB presented a proposal entitled CAB Distribution Guidelines for Canadian Talent Development.\nPayments made according to this schedule would replace all current, ongoing Canadian talent development commitments made in the context of licence renewals. They would not, however, replace benefit commitments made at the time of an ownership or control transaction or commitments to expenditures during the first term of a new licence.\nLicensees would send their contributions directly to eligible third parties; these would include FACTOR, MusicAction, national and provincial music organizations, performing arts groups, schools and scholarship recipients.\nStations would apply to the Commission for a condition of licence requiring them to adhere to the CAB Distribution Guidelines for Canadian Talent Development. The CRTC would require licensees to demonstrate compliance by submitting proof of their contributions to third party organizations as part of their annual returns.\nThe Commission remains convinced that Canadian talent development initiatives undertaken by radio stations play an important role in fostering the careers of new Canadian artists. Consequently, it will continue to expect licensees to fulfil commitments to Canadian talent development offered as benefits in applications for authority to transfer ownership or control of radio stations or contained in applications for new licences, including those involving a move from the AM to the FM band.\nThe Commission, however, shares the concerns of the broadcasting industry that the financial and administrative burden of the current system is too heavy, especially given the difficult financial circumstances faced by many radio stations. The Commission also considers that its own workload and diminished resources argue for a more steamlined approach to Canadian talent development. It therefore views as a reasonable approach the establishment of a system that, through the licence renewal process, would ensure a minimum annual payment of $1.8 million to third parties involved with Canadian talent development. Such an approach will ensure that these third parties continue to receive the same level of funding that they currently receive through the licence renewal process, while decreasing the overall financial and administrative burden on radio licensees and the Commission.\nIn light of concerns expressed by recording industry representatives that the proposed annual contribution of $1.8 million by the radio industry could become a maximum rather than a minimum, the Commission will review this base level in five years to determine whether it remains adequate. With respect to local Canadian talent initiatives, the Commission notes comments by broadcasters that many radio stations will continue to undertake these projects on their own initiative.\nThe Commission, however, has the following concerns with respect to the plan submitted by the CAB.\nThe success of the CAB plan depends on the participation of almost all private commercial radio stations, regardless of their profitability, to raise a minimum of $1.8 million annually for third parties involved in Canadian talent development. To participate in the CAB plan, licensees of radio stations must submit applications to the Commission to be relieved of their current Canadian talent development commitments and to amend their licences by adding a condition of licence requiring them to make payments in accordance with the CAB's Canadian talent development distribution guidelines. As well, the plan assumes participation by radio stations who are not CAB members and may not yet be aware of all aspects of the plan.\nThe Commission, however, notes the CAB's assurances that support for the plan is very high and agrees that, since the majority of radio stations would see their contributions to Canadian talent development decrease under the CAB plan, a high level of participation is likely. The Commission is also reluctant to delay unnecessarily the implementation of a more efficient system for Canadian talent development.\nThe Commission will therefore proceed as follows: licensees of private commercial radio stations have until 16 February 1996 to apply to the Commission for licence amendments, using the form attached to this notice as Appendix 2. Once the Commission has received the applications, it will process them expeditiously via public notice.\nOnce the new conditions of licence are in place, the Commission's intention is to require licensees to report, using their annual returns, the amounts directed to specific third parties associated with Canadian talent development. The Commission will generally expect licensees to ensure that at least half of the annual payments made by each are made in the first quarter of each fiscal year, with the remaining amount to be paid before the end of the third quarter.\nIn its plan, the CAB expressed agreement with the Commission's definition of eligible third parties as including \"FACTOR, MusicAction, national and provincial music organizations, performing arts groups, schools and scholarship recipients.\" The Commission wishes to clarify that, in accordance with its current practice, all money going to third parties must be directly connected to the development of Canadian musical and other artistic talent.\nAlthough it notes the suggestion by one party that provincially-administered post-secondary training programs should qualify as eligible recipients of Canadian talent development funding, the Commission has determined that grants to schools will generally be eligible expenditures for purposes of Canadian talent development only when directed to arts faculties to purchase instruments or undertake performances, or when such grants are used to fund other projects related to the development of musical and artistic talent. Scholarships will qualify as Canadian talent development expenditures only when they support students engaged in music, journalism or other artistic studies. Grants to those organizations offering courses in broadcasting or devoted to the continuing education of radio station staff will not qualify.\nThe Commission reiterates that the CAB plan will apply only to commitments for Canadian talent development that are made in the context of licence renewals. Licensees will be expected, for the duration of their first licence term, to adhere to existing Canadian talent development commitments made in the context of their applications for new radio licences, including commitments made by licensees who have moved from the AM to the FM band. LIcensees will also be expected to adhere to those commitments proposed as benefits in applications for authority to transfer the ownership or control of radio stations.\nThe licensee hereby applies for relief from its current direct cost commitments for Canadian talent development made as part of its last licence renewal, and to amend its licence by adding a condition of licence requiring it to make payments to third parties involved in Canadian talent development at the level identified for it in the CAB Distribution Guidelines For Canadian Talent Development, as set out in Public Notice CRTC 1995-196 or as amended from time to time and approved by the Commission, and to report the names of the third parties associated with Canadian talent development, together with the amounts paid to each, on its annual return.\nThe licensee acknowledges that the payments required under the requested condition of licence are over and above any outstanding commitments to Canadian talent development offered as benefits in an application to acquire ownership or control of the undertaking.",

    "text": "For what reason is the use of words of wisdom (prophetic words in regards to the future) critical and for what purpose is it imperative to know about the significance of their utilization in ministry? Since wisdom causes us to comprehend the difference between what is good and bad in God\u2019s sight, procuring and practicing wisdom will prompt bliss and longevity of life (Proverbs 3:13-16). It is a vital quality God needs to find in us. Below mentioned are some other additional factors showing the importance of utilization of words of wisdom throughout our life and ministry as well.\nAbove all else, it is exceptionally basic to comprehend that the blessings of the Holy Spirit don\u2019t work at our will, however, must be showed when we live our lives dedicated to God and His ministry on earth, as indicated by the covenant we have entered through the forfeit of Jesus on the cross. We surrendered our lives to him and we ought to anticipate that His life to flow over us.\nWords of Wisdom are explicit messages from God with respect to what\u2019s to come. When we are in charge of a specific ministry and genuinely position ourselves by words and deeds in like manner as leaders, we discover God directing us through explicit words in regards to the way, he needs us to take, either by advising us of what the fate of one way brings or by empowering us by the brilliant promises of another.\nEducating of the Word of God is fragmented without Words of Wisdom. Like Words of Knowledge, Words of Wisdom make the Bible a LIVING WORD. Instructing and lecturing the Gospel without being available to this region, renders the Bible an unimportant manual, while Words of Wisdom open the endless element of the Word for all to perceive what lies ahead. At last, we can just really motivate the people of God to make an explicit move with respect to their lives, when the message being lectured rises above the regular and focuses to the prize that lies ahead.\nThose who are following us, do as such as a result of the blessing we have, they will confront genuine circumstances where they should hear a word from God in regards to their future. God will address them through us when we take responsibility for the position of a prophet over their lives. Individuals need to get notification from God with respect to a job offer, a voyaging plan, a business deal, and so forth. Besides, we should work in Words of Wisdom with the end goal to prepare devotees to trust in God and the blessing. This fortifies their confidence.\nRegardless of whether it is healing or throwing out evil spirits, Words of Wisdom are the projectiles of the prophet to announce to the sickness and the demon where he is going. We are called to lecture the Good News not exclusively to men, yet in addition to evil spirits and to this fallen nature.\nWhat God proclaims through us today will set the stage or the establishment on which future ages will assemble. Except if we are available to God what needs to state today in regards to the future, we will announce the demise of our service with us on earth.\nAt long last, Words of Wisdom keep us reminded on our actual character and calling. They advise us that we don\u2019t have a place with this age yet to the one to come. The utilization of Words of Wisdom turns us resistant to the stresses of the present life. Through confidence, it keeps us strolling on the waters of unceasing life.\nPaul Davis is a renowned healing minister. He lives in New York, where he primarily teaches, writes, and offers workshops on journaling and spiritual growth. Paul heads a number of healing ministries New York in the past. Paul makes every effort to combine his own faith with the world\u2019s spiritual teachings and to facilitate the world make well from its past record of religious abuse.\nWhich Car Wash Is Best For Your Car?",

You just push a small button that pauses the water flow so that you can lather up, shampoo your hair, or shave! I LOVE that!!!\nOnce you put in your new showerhead, your old shower caddy will just look SO out of place! Do yourself a favor and get a new caddy.

I decided to give myself one day on the weekends as my \u201ccheat\u201d day and enjoy something that I love. We decided on spaghetti and meatballs. No argument from the family, either. We all love spaghetti.\nThese homemade Italian meatballs were sooooo good and really simple to make. I\u2019m going to share the recipe with you.

Watch carefully so you don\u2019t burn them.\nWe recently remodeled and updated our kitchen. I wanted a white farmhouse kitchen, and that\u2019s what I got. However, the beadboard backsplash around the counter and the panel behind the stove is white and shows ALL kinds of splatters. Spaghetti making the worst messes, naturally. The sauce is yummy, but it\u2019s also messy. When it bubbles, it pops and splatters everywhere. Do you have the same issue?\nI also opted for all white dish towels and dish cloths. I just love the way they look in a kitchen. So fresh and crisp. I never even thought how EVERY thing that you clean up stains those pretty white towels and cloths and they get really dingy really fast.\nBounty recently came out with a BRAND new kind of paper towel. It\u2019s Bounty with Dawn, ya\u2019ll. With Dawn. They\u2019re thicker than your average paper towel and you just activate them with water. Then they get all nice and sudsy! I am in LOVE with these. You can rinse and wring these puppies out so you can clean up the whole mess with ONE paper towel instead of 10!\nDawn is awesome at fighting grease so that combined with the thickness of these new Bounty with Dawn paper towels is a double-whammy! The towels were good at breaking up dried on food too. I had the oven on, baking the meatballs and the sauce and spaghetti on the stovetop. The heat from the stove made the sauce dry up and after dinner, the new Bounty with Dawn paper towel wiped it up in just a couple of swipes. I was VERY impressed!\nMake sure to check out the new Bounty with Dawn paper towels the next time you\u2019re at Walmart and pick up a roll to try for yourself. I think you\u2019ll love them as much as I do. Keep in mind that these do not replace paper towels for food prep. My husband almost stuck the meatballs out of the oven onto one of these to soak the grease up. I was like, noooooooo!!!! I don\u2019t want my meatballs to taste like Dawn dish soap, hahaha!!!\nVisit Bounty on Facebook and on Twitter for news, updates and promotions!\nWhat do you typically use to clean up tough messes?\nI participated in the NIOXIN Challenge blog program as a member of One2One Network. I received free product and compensation but all opinions are my own.\nAll of my life I\u2019ve had thin and really fine hair. I have always struggled with getting curls to stay in or when I style my hair, it just flops after a couple of hours. I remember my mom jumping on me for using rubber bands as ponytail holders cause she said it would break my hair off. They were perfect ponytail holders for me though, because just about anything else would end up loosening and sliding off.\nI found out about the NIOXIN Hair System Kits and jumped at the chance to review one. I had heard rave reviews so I really wanted to try it out. I was asked to do the NIOXIN 30 Day Challenge and then share my experience. NIOXIN has 6 different hair system kits and I chose system 3 for normal to thin-looking hair with color treatment (yes, I color my hair!). Each kit includes an easy 3 step daily regimen including shampoo, conditioner and a treatment.\nThe first thing I noticed when starting the 30 day challenge was the tingling and refreshing sensation on my scalp. Other than that, I didn\u2019t really notice a big difference that first week in my hair. Then by the middle of the 2nd week, I started noticing that my hair was much easier to fix and that my hairstyle would last longer than usual. It just felt fuller as I would curl or straighten my hair.\nBy the end of the 30 day challenge, my husband even noticed a difference just by looking at my hair. He knew that I had a new product in the shower (which I dared him to use, haha!) but he usually doesn\u2019t pay much attention. He\u2019s used to it being flat as a pancake and he came home from work one day and asked if I\u2019d been to my \u201chair guy\u201d. HA! Overall, my hair feels much fuller. I\u2019m very pleased with NIOXIN and will continue using it!\nWe encourage YOU to take the NIOXIN 30 Day Challenge and see if you don\u2019t notice fuller, thicker hair.

I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with you anyway\u2026I don\u2019t need that sort of negativity in my life. Now, my cookie friends, check out these insane S\u2019mores Cookies!!!\nCookies are just pure pleasure. Especially when they\u2019re warm, straight outta the oven. AND even more especially \u2013 when they\u2019re filled with S\u2019more gooey-ness! HELLO!!! These new Pillsbury Melts are INSANELY delish! They are filled on the inside with yummy goo and topped with a chocolate drizzle. Oh, and in 2 different flavors\u2026.Molten Fudge Cake and S\u2019more Sensation! You can find both of these in the refrigerated cookie dough section. Which is where I spend about 85.677777% of my time when I\u2019m grocery shopping.\nBaking was easy peasy\u2026just like the other Pillsbury Ready to Bake Cookies, they\u2019re already made into little cookie balls for you. SWEET! Just plop them on a pan and bake for a few minutes. After they\u2019ve cooled a bit, just drizzle that yummy chocolate on top! Mmmm. Well, the whole pan was demolished within minutes. I\u2019ll just say that much.\nWe tried the S\u2019mores cookies and man oh mannnn. They were sooo good! I\u2019m saving the Molten Fudge Cake cookies for this weekend. That way my husband can get at least ONE cookie before they\u2019re el-gono! These cookies are perfect for anytime, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be making these around the holidays too. So easy\u2026and so yummy.\nWhich one of these new Pillsbury Melts cookies are you excited to try? Or do you just want to try BOTH?!\nYou might want to visit the Pillsbury Facebook page too, they\u2019re always sharing FAN-flipping tastic recipes that are easy and delicious.\nFriends, football season is coming! It\u2019s not THAT far away and I am so excited! I love football and fall weather. It\u2019s the Tennessee gal\u2019s favorite time of the year. I can almost smell the crisp fall air and hear the roar of the fans in the stadium. That just makes me smile!!\nWe are making an effort to eat healthier and so we wanted to take something we love\u2026pizza\u2026and give it a healthy tailgating twist without losing any flavor or fun! So I was super excited to try this new pizza tray grill pan from Gourmet Grillware.\nThis pizza tray is so versatile. It withstands heat up to 1000\u00b0F and can be used on the grill, on the stove or in the oven. It\u2019s even freezer safe!! It\u2019s made of food safe aluminum alloy which makes for even heating and easy browning on any surface. It also means it isn\u2019t dishwasher safe. But, it\u2019s so easy to clean you won\u2019t even care!\nI know you don\u2019t believe me when I say that this homemade pizza is simple. But trust me, it is SO easy to make! You can whip it up in no time flat.\nMix all ingredients together until you have a dough similar to biscuit dough. It\u2019s not a firm dough. It will be somewhat spreadable.\nPlace your Gourmet Grillware Pizza Tray onto a stove eye on medium/high heat. Spray on some non-stick cooking spray or spread a little vegetable oil on the pan. Plop your dough on and spread it to the thickness that you desire. Let is sit for a bit and brown. Once it\u2019s nice and golden, flip it and brown the other side. Use potholders to carefully remove the pan from the eye. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0 at this point.\nWe chose chicken, zucchinni, onions, garlic and spinach. In a medium pan, with a tablespoon of olive oil my hubby sauteed all the veggies together with a pinch of salt. We keep cooked chicken on hand. He grabbed a chicken breast, chopped it up and threw it in the pan. Once everything was heated through and the onions were translucent, the heat is turned off.\nThis pizza has NO SAUCE! No, I am not kidding. It\u2019s a waste of calories and would overpower the flavors of the veggies. All you do is pour your cooked toppings onto your crust and sprinkle on whatever shredded cheese you may have on hand. Cheese isn\u2019t necessary but can act as a glue to hold all the veggies on the pizza. Throw the pan into your preheated oven and wait for everything to heat up and the cheese to melt.\nCarefully remove your pizza on the Gourmet Grillware Pizza Tray, from the oven. Let it stand for 10 minutes then cut and serve. Another great thing about this pizza tray is that it is also a great serving dish. So you can cut the pizza right on the tough tray and then carry it straight to the table and enjoy!!\nWant to win a set of Gourmet Grillware? You can!
